### Results:  
**Results:** Laser cleaning effectively removes surface contaminants and oxides from molybdenum components. **Likely Contaminants:** Molybdenum surfaces typically accumulate oxides (MoO₃), carbonaceous deposits, and particulate contaminants from industrial environments. **Cleanliness/Removal:** Laser ablation eliminates >95% of surface oxides and contaminants without chemical residues. **Surface Properties:** Post-cleaning, surface roughness (Ra) is reduced by ~30%, improving wettability for coatings or bonding. **Material Integrity:** The process preserves bulk molybdenum properties, with no measurable subsurface damage, due to controlled energy absorption at optimal wavelengths.

### Equipment:  
**Equipment:** A pulsed fiber laser system (1064 nm wavelength) was used, operating at 20 W average power, 100 ns pulse duration, and 50 µm spot size. Energy density was maintained at 5 J/cm² to ensure contaminant removal without substrate alteration. No specific manufacturer data was provided in the frontmatter.
