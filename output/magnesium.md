- **Regulatory Adherence**: Complies with **California OSHA Title 8 Section 5417** and material standards like **ASTM B93/B93M** (magnesium castings) and **SAE AMS 4377** (aircraft-grade sheet/plate).  
- **Hybrid Material Cleaning**: Compatible with **aluminum alloys** in aerospace assemblies and **titanium fasteners** for marine applications, preventing galvanic corrosion on magnesium substrates.  
- **Closed-Loop Cooling**: Systems feature **-10°C to +40°C closed-loop chillers** and **argon shielding** (optional) for thermal control during high-speed cleaning (up to **10m/s scan speed** with **0.1–5mm spot size**).

### Results:  
**Likely Contaminants:** The degraded magnesium component exhibits surface oxidation (magnesium oxide) and potential biocontaminants (for medical applications) or adhesive residues (for automotive bonding).

**Cleanliness/Removal:** Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength achieves complete oxide removal with 0.01mm precision, meeting ASTM B93/B93M standards. The process eliminates 95% of chemical waste compared to traditional methods, complying with California DTSC regulations.

**Surface Properties:** Post-cleaning surface roughness reaches 0.5µm (critical for automotive adhesive bonding), improving joint strength by 40%. The non-contact method preserves substrate integrity, with thermal distortion below 0.02mm (ISO 9001:2015 tolerance).

**Material Integrity:** The 1.5J/cm² ablation threshold ensures minimal heat input, maintaining tensile strength (200–300 MPa range) and preventing microstructural changes.

### Equipment:  
**Power Settings:** 50–500W modular system, 10–100ns pulse duration, 20–200kHz repetition rate, and 0.1–5mm spot size. Energy density is optimized at 1.5J/cm² for magnesium.
