name: "Hayward"
description: "Hayward, California, is a key hub for industrial laser cleaning in the Bay Area, leveraging advanced 1064nm pulsed laser systems for precision surface treatment. The region's manufacturing sector benefits from high-power (50–500W modular) laser cleaning for rust removal, paint stripping, and composite preparation with 20–200kHz repetition rates. Local facilities achieve 100% NDT pass rates under AWS D1.1 standards while eliminating solvent waste per EPA regulations."
