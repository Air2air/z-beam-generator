- **Fixed 80 materials**
- Backup: `backups/laser_optical_fixes_20251016_133912/`

### Result:
- **Before**: 28.7% compliance
- **After**: 100% compliance
- All materials now obey conservation of energy

## Issue 2: Thermal Diffusivity ✅ FIXED

### Problem:
- **61 of 122 materials** had thermal diffusivity values inconsistent with formula: α = k / (ρ × Cp)
- Errors ranged from 20% to 1,249,216% (!)

### Worst Cases:
- Hickory: 1,249,216% error (measured 1650 mm²/s, should be 0.13)
- Walnut: 1,055,900% error (measured 1650 mm²/s, should be 0.16)
- Plywood: 789,425% error (measured 1450 mm²/s, should be 0.18)
- Beryllium: 123,790% error (measured 70,000 mm²/s, should be 56.50)

### Solution:
- Recalculated thermal diffusivity from thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat
- **Fixed 61 materials** with errors > 20%
- Backup: `backups/thermal_diffusivity_fixes_*/`

### Result:
- All materials now have thermally consistent property values
- Formula: α = (k / (ρ × Cp)) × 10⁶ mm²/s

## Issue 3: Electrical Conductivity ✅ FIXED

### Problem:
- **2 materials** had non-standard units:
  - Copper: 5.96 ×10⁷ S/m
  - Zinc: 16.6% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard)

### Solution:
- **Copper**: Converted to 59.6 MS/m (multiply by 10)
- **Zinc**: Converted to 16.9 MS/m (29% IACS using 58.1 MS/m for 100% IACS)

### Result:
- All 7 materials with electricalConductivity now use MS/m (megasiemens per meter)
- 100% unit consistency

## Issue 4: Young's Modulus ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

### Problem Discovered:
**79 of 122 materials** (64.8%) have unusual E/TS (Young's Modulus / Tensile Strength) ratios.

Expected ratio for most materials: **100-300**  
Found ratios: **500 to 26,342**

### Most Severe Cases (Wood Materials):

| Material | E (GPa) | TS (MPa) | E/TS Ratio | Expected Ratio |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Teak | 2502.5 | 95.0 | 26,342 | 100-300 |
| Oak | 2502.5 | 95.0 | 26,342 | 100-300 |
| Walnut | 2502.5 | 101.0 | 24,777 | 100-300 |
| Maple | 2502.5 | 108.9 | 22,980 | 100-300 |
| Beech | 2502.5 | 120.0 | 20,854 | 100-300 |
| Bamboo | 2502.5 | 140.0 | 17,875 | 100-300 |
| Rosewood | 2502.5 | 157.0 | 15,940 | 100-300 |

**Root Cause**: Young's Modulus for wood appears to be **~100x too high**
- All wood materials have E = 2502.5 GPa
- Typical wood E should be: **10-20 GPa**
- This suggests a unit conversion error or data source issue

### Stone/Masonry Issues:

| Material | E (GPa) | TS (MPa) | E/TS Ratio | Issue |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| Stucco | 20.7 | 1.4 | 14,786 | E too high or TS too low |
| Calcite | 70.0 | 6.0 | 11,667 | E too high or TS too low |
| Alabaster | 31.0 | 3.5 | 8,857 | E too high or TS too low |
| Concrete | 30.0 | 3.5 | 8,571 | E too high or TS too low |
| Granite | 55.0 | 7.5 | 7,333 | E too high or TS too low |

### Recommended Fix:
1. **Wood materials**: Divide E by 100 (likely unit error: 2502.5 GPa → 25.0 GPa)
2. **Stone/masonry**: Review tensile strength values (seem too low)
3. **Validate against reference data**: MatWeb, ASM Handbook, CRC Materials Handbook
