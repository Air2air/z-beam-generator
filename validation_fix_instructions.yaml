# Validation Fix Instructions for Claude
# This document provides systematic instructions for analyzing and fixing validation failures

analysis_protocol:
  step1: "Read terminal validation output to identify specific error types and failed components"
  step2: "Check current file contents to understand any manual changes made"
  step3: "Compare against schema requirements to identify missing or incorrect fields"
