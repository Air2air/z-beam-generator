caption:
  before: Under microscopy, fused silica's contaminated surface reveals clustered particulates and oily residues, forming
    hazy films. Contaminants manifest as submicron to 5-micron irregular specks, likely airborne dust or handling oils. Surface
    degradation shows micro-pitting and subtle etching, reducing optical clarity in laser diode assembly.
  after: After cleaning, fused silica surfaces restore to pristine optical clarity, preserving full material integrity and
    smoothness. This supports reliable performance in laser system optics for precision manufacturing.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, fused silica can be safely laser cleaned by carefully controlling parameters. Using a 1064 nm wavelength
      with a fluence below 2.5 J/cm² and nanosecond pulses minimizes thermal shock risks to its amorphous structure. This
      approach effectively removes contaminants while preventing subsurface damage and micro-crack formation in the glass.
    question: Can fused silica be laser cleaned without causing damage or micro-cracks?
  - answer: For fused silica optics, UV wavelengths around 355nm are superior. They are strongly absorbed by most contaminants,
      enabling effective ablation at fluences below the substrate's ~2.5 J/cm² damage threshold. This provides the necessary
      separation to clean thoroughly without harming the optic's surface.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength for cleaning contaminants from fused silica optics?
  - answer: We use 1064 nm nanosecond pulses at ~2.5 J/cm² to selectively ablate thin films. This fluence is above the coating's
      ablation threshold but safely below the level that would etch the pristine fused silica substrate.
    question: How do you remove thin film coatings from fused silica using a laser without etching the surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning near the 2.5 J/cm² threshold risks creating microscopic damage precursors, which can lower Fused
      Silica's LIDT. Post-cleaning measurements often reveal a reduced damage threshold from these subsurface modifications,
      compromising performance in high-power systems.
    question: What are the LIDT (Laser-Induced Damage Threshold) concerns when laser cleaning fused silica optics?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning below the 2.5 J/cm² threshold avoids OH group formation. However, excessive
      fluence can induce surface chemistry changes, potentially increasing hydrogen bonding and degrading UV transmission.
      Maintaining optimal parameters is critical for long-term optical stability.
    question: Does laser cleaning create OH group contamination or other chemical changes on the fused silica surface?
  - answer: The key precaution is staying below fused silica's 2.5 J/cm² damage threshold to prevent subsurface cracking.
      Unlike metals, its low thermal conductivity creates stress fractures. Always use respiratory PPE for the fine silica
      particulates generated.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning fused silica compared to metals?
  - answer: Laser cleaning can mitigate existing sub-surface damage when operated below fused silica's ~2.5 J/cm² damage threshold.
      However, exceeding this fluence with 10 ns pulses will certainly introduce new microfractures, defeating the conditioning
      objective.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing sub-surface damage (SSD) in fused silica?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively replaces traditional methods for fused silica, achieving superior particle removal
      below 2.5 J/cm². This non-contact process, using 1064 nm wavelength, eliminates organics without solvents, enhancing
      throughput and enabling validation via light scatter testing for critical optics.
    question: Can laser cleaning replace traditional methods like CO2 snow or solvent cleaning for fused silica in cleanroom
      environments?
  - answer: Fused silica's remarkably low 0.55 ppm/°C thermal expansion coefficient allows surface temperatures up to approximately
      300°C before stress failure. To maintain this, keep your fluence below the 2.5 J/cm² damage threshold and utilize high
      500 mm/s scan speeds to minimize localized heating and prevent destructive thermal gradients.
    question: What is the maximum allowable surface temperature during laser cleaning of fused silica to prevent thermal stress
      failure?
  - answer: Verification requires multiple techniques. We confirm surface integrity using white-light interferometry, ensuring
      no profile change above 2 nm. Scatterometry checks for residual particles, while transmission measurements at 1064 nm
      must show no degradation from the baseline. This multi-faceted approach guarantees the optic's performance is fully
      restored.
    question: How do you verify the success of a laser cleaning process on a fused silica optic?
