caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the stoneware surface appears very-very contaminated with clustered particles and oily residues
    from food processing, sticking tightly and embedding into pores. Degradation shows as micro-cracks, pitting, and discoloration,
    so the texture becomes rough-rough and uneven, compromising its cultural heritage integrity.
  after: The stoneware surface is cleaned very-very effectively by ultrafast laser process, removing contaminants then revealing
    original texture smooth-smooth. It appears pristine and clean, with restoration quality high-high, preserving material
    integrity without cracks or weakening. So, the ceramic maintains durability for cultural heritage preservation and food
    processing applications, ensuring safe and authentic use.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For glazed stoneware, the 1064 nm near-infrared wavelength excels at ablating soot and grease, thanks to high
      contaminant absorption and low penetration into the ceramic substrate, preserving its integrity. This beats 532 nm,
      which could overheat glazes, and avoids abrasive techniques' risk of surface scratching—aim for 5 J/cm² fluence for
      safe, uniform results.
    question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning soot and grease from glazed stoneware without affecting
      the underlying ceramic structure?
  - answer: To prevent thermal shock in antique stoneware pottery during pulsed laser cleaning, use 10 ns pulses at 5 J/cm²
      fluence, which curbs rapid heat spikes on this low-conductivity ceramic with its moderate thermal expansion. Mild pre-heating
      to 40°C beforehand equalizes surface temperatures, reducing stress risks while ensuring gentle contaminant removal.
    question: How can thermal shock be prevented when using pulsed lasers to clean antique stoneware pottery?
  - answer: Strong adhesion of metal oxides to stoneware's porous ceramic matrix poses a key challenge in industrial laser
      ablation, demanding precise fluence of 5 J/cm² to vaporize contaminants without fracturing the substrate. Thermal sensitivity
      requires nanosecond pulses at 50 kHz for control, and post-cleaning spectroscopy analysis often reveals trace residues
      needing multiple passes for full removal.
    question: In industrial settings, what are the common challenges in removing metal oxides from stoneware surfaces using
      laser ablation?
  - answer: In art restoration workshops, wear ANSI Z136.1-compliant laser safety goggles rated for 1064 nm wavelengths to
      shield eyes from stray beams during stoneware cleaning. Ensure robust ventilation systems capture ceramic dust at under
      5 mg/m³ to prevent inhalation risks. Monitor surface temperatures below 200°C with IR thermography, using 5 J/cm² fluence
      to avoid thermal stress and glaze cracking on this porous ceramic.
    question: What safety protocols should be followed when laser cleaning stoneware in art restoration workshops to avoid
      glaze cracking?
  - answer: Porosity in unglazed stoneware lets laser beams penetrate deeper, scattering energy into voids and lowering efficiency
      for removing surface organic residues. Opt for a 1064 nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence to boost targeted absorption,
      ideal for porous ceramics versus denser ones needing tighter pulse control.
    question: How does the porosity of unglazed stoneware affect the efficiency of laser cleaning for organic residues?
  - answer: For stoneware tiles in architectural settings, manufacturers suggest 100 W average power at 1064 nm wavelength
      to gently ablate grime without harming the ceramic matrix. Pair this with 500 mm/s scan speeds and 5 J/cm² fluence,
      starting with test patches on varied compositions for optimal results.
    question: What are the typical laser power settings recommended by manufacturers for cleaning stoneware tiles in architectural
      applications?
  - answer: Laser cleaning of food-grade stoneware effectively removes oils without chemicals, aligning with FDA guidelines
      for inert ceramic surfaces that prevent leaching. At 5 J/cm² fluence and 1064 nm wavelength, it ablates contaminants
      precisely, minimizing thermal stress—validate efficacy via surface residue tests below 10 ppm for compliance.
    question: In food-grade stoneware cleaning, are there regulatory concerns with laser methods removing contaminants like
      food oils?
  - answer: Dry laser cleaning proves more effective for restoring faded colors on weathered stoneware sculptures, using 1064
      nm wavelength and 5 J/cm² fluence to precisely ablate surface grime without water. This avoids absorption damage in
      porous ceramics like stoneware, unlike wet techniques that risk cracking or staining, while offering eco-friendly results
      and better preservation of original textures.
    question: How effective is dry laser cleaning compared to wet methods for restoring color on weathered stoneware sculptures?
  - answer: Stoneware glazes, rich in silica content around 60-70%, strongly absorb near-infrared light at 1064 nm, making
      Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers ideal for surface treatment without excessive heating. This minimizes melting risks during
      pottery production, especially at fluences of 5 J/cm², ensuring precise contaminant removal while preserving the glaze's
      integrity.
    question: What chemical properties of stoneware glazes influence the choice of laser for surface treatment in pottery
      production?
