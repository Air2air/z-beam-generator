caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the lead surface reveals a heavily contaminated condition, with irregular oxide layers and particulate
    debris adhering tightly, causing pitting, micro-cracks, and overall degradation that dulls its metallic sheen.
  after: The lead surface, now impeccably cleaned via laser ablation, reveals a smooth, uniform finish free from oxides and
    residues. This restoration excels in quality, fully preserving the metal's integrity—its density, malleability, and corrosion
    resistance remain unaltered. Such precision ensures reliable performance in diverse applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning of lead-based paint requires extreme caution due to toxic fume generation. Using a 1064 nm wavelength
      at a low fluence of 2.5 J/cm² minimizes particulate release. Operators must employ high-efficiency local exhaust ventilation
      and wear supplied-air respiratory protection to ensure safety.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for lead-based paint removal, and what specific safety measures are required?
  - answer: For lead decontamination, employ nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence around 2.5 J/cm². This configuration,
      using a fiber laser, effectively ablates surface contaminants while the short pulse duration minimizes thermal penetration,
      thus preventing hazardous vaporization of the underlying lead substrate.
    question: What laser parameters (wavelength, pulse duration, power) work best for removing lead contamination without
      vaporizing it?
  - answer: For lead particle capture, we employ HEPA filtration rated for nanoparticles below 100nm. The vacuum system must
      maintain high velocity, using our standard 50 μm spot size and 500 mm/s scan speed to contain the toxic plume effectively.
    question: How do you properly capture and filter lead particles generated during laser cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser ablation of lead at 2.5 J/cm² can generate hazardous aerosols. Continuous air monitoring is mandatory,
      as particulate levels often surpass the OSHA PEL of 50 μg/m³. Proper local exhaust ventilation is absolutely essential
      to maintain compliance.
    question: Does laser cleaning create airborne lead levels that exceed OSHA exposure limits?
  - answer: Laser cleaning significantly reduces hazardous waste volume compared to traditional methods. Our 1064 nm wavelength
      and 2.5 J/cm² fluence enable selective removal without media contamination, crucial for sensitive applications like
      nuclear components. This process minimizes secondary waste generation, enhancing safety and efficiency.
    question: What are the advantages of laser cleaning over traditional methods (blasting, chemical stripping) for lead removal?
  - answer: Proper laser parameters like 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 10 ns pulses effectively ablate surface lead without significant
      substrate penetration. For porous materials like concrete, we recommend initial surface sealing. Post-process verification
      testing is essential to confirm complete decontamination.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove lead from porous surfaces like concrete or wood without driving it deeper?
  - answer: Given lead's toxicity, you must wear a P100 respirator and disposable coveralls. Our 1064 nm laser at 100 W creates
      hazardous fumes and fine particulates. Strict decontamination protocols for your PPE and equipment are absolutely essential
      after each session.
    question: What personal protective equipment (PPE) is specifically needed for laser cleaning of lead-containing materials?
  - answer: We verify lead removal using XRF analysis and swipe tests, targeting clearance below 10 µg/100 cm². Our 1064 nm
      laser system, operating at 2.5 J/cm², ensures complete decontamination. Proper documentation of all parameters is essential
      for regulatory acceptance.
    question: How do you test and verify that laser cleaning has effectively removed lead to meet regulatory standards?
  - answer: Laser-ablated lead debris is classified as hazardous waste D008. It must be sealed in certified containers for
      transport and disposal. The fine particulate generated at 2.5 J/cm² fluence can be recycled by specialized facilities,
      which is the preferred management route for this toxic metal.
    question: What waste classification does laser-ablated lead debris fall under, and how should it be disposed?
  - answer: Cleaning lead in confined spaces demands extreme caution. The 1064 nm wavelength at 100W power generates highly
      concentrated toxic fumes requiring continuous atmospheric monitoring. You must implement enhanced local exhaust ventilation
      and emergency protocols, as airborne lead concentrations can rapidly exceed 500 µg/m³, the typical occupational exposure
      limit.
    question: Are there specific laser safety considerations when cleaning lead in confined spaces?
