caption:
  before: Microscopic examination of the untreated brass surface reveals meticulous evidence of heavy contamination from atmospheric
    oxidation and particulate dirt, forming a dull, tarnished layer. Visible degradation includes pitting and micro-cracks
    across the alloy grains, with irregular discoloration and embedded debris compromising the craftsmanship of the metallic
    luster and structural integrity.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy reveals a restored brass surface, achieved with meticulous removal of contaminants,
    unveiling a smooth, polished finish of refined elegance. Material integrity remains intact, exhibiting uniform grain structure
    without ablation damage, enhanced reflectivity, and minimal residual pitting for optimal precision in surface condition.

  description: Brass laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste streams by removing contaminants and oxides through ablation,
    avoiding the use of acidic pickling solutions or solvent-based degreasers. This process produces only minute, collectable
    solid waste, preventing the generation of hazardous liquid effluents and spent chemical baths.

  benefit: Water Usage Reduction
  description: Brass laser cleaning eliminates the need for chemical solvents and abrasive media, directly conserving water
    by removing the requirement for post-process rinsing and media slurry management. This dry process prevents the generation
    of contaminated wastewater streams associated with traditional cleaning methods.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Energy Efficiency
  description: Brass laser cleaning achieves energy efficiency by utilizing high absorption of laser wavelengths, enabling
    rapid contaminant removal with minimal energy input. This process eliminates the need for secondary drying or chemical
    heating stages required by wet methods, reducing total energy consumption per unit.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  description: Brass laser cleaning eliminates the use of chemical solvents and abrasive media, preventing the release of
    volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere. The process is a dry, non-abrasive
    method that converts contaminants into easily collectable fumes, ensuring no secondary pollutants are generated from the
    brass substrate itself.

    measured via before/after mass spectrometry to detect trace metallic elements from corrosion products. The analysis must
    account for the potential for zinc evaporation from the brass substrate, which can be differentiated from contaminant
    mass loss through targeted chemical analysis.
