caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the platinum surface appears very-very rough and uneven, covered by contaminants that
    stick and accumulate irregularly. These contaminants, mostly fine particles and oily residues from handling, show clustered
    shapes around 5-20 micrometers, darkening the metallic sheen. Surface degradation is evident in micro-pits and scratches,
    so the material looks weakened, affecting its use in aerospace and medical devices.
  after: The cleaned platinum surface appears very-very smooth and pristine, restored effectively by ultrafast laser process.
    Restoration quality maintains material integrity fully, so no defects occur, ensuring suitability for aerospace, medical
    devices, and electronics.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning won't damage platinum coatings when fluence is carefully controlled below its ablation threshold,
      typically under 5 J/cm². Using nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength minimizes thermal stress. Verification via scanning
      electron microscopy confirms the underlying layer remains intact post-process.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage the thin platinum coating on medical devices or catalytic converters?
  - answer: For platinum jewelry, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength fiber lasers with 10 ns pulses at 5 J/cm² fluence. This balances
      platinum's high reflectivity while minimizing heat penetration. The 50 μm spot size with 500 mm/s scanning prevents
      micro-pitting by limiting thermal accumulation in the precious metal substrate.
    question: What laser wavelength (nm) and pulse duration work best for cleaning platinum jewelry without causing micro-pitting?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence effectively removes platinum oxides without chemical residues. This maintains
      surface purity for high-temperature applications, unlike acid methods that risk contamination. The 1064 nm wavelength
      ensures minimal thermal impact on the substrate.
    question: How do you safely remove oxidation layers from platinum crucibles used in laboratory settings without altering
      their chemical purity?
  - answer: For platinum components with absorbed contaminants like arsenic, implement Class III fume extraction and full-face
      respirators. The 1064 nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² efficiently removes hazardous materials while minimizing toxic fume generation.
      Always conduct material safety analysis before processing.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning platinum components that may have absorbed hazardous
      materials in industrial processes?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence actually enhances platinum's electrochemical performance. The
      process removes contaminants while creating beneficial micro-roughness, increasing active surface area without introducing
      impurities that degrade catalytic activity.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the electrochemical properties of platinum electrodes used in scientific instruments?
  - answer: Untuk platinum dengan titik leleh 1768°C, rapat daya aman maksimum sekitar 5 J/cm² pada laser 1064 nm. Konduktivitas
      termalnya yang tinggi memungkinkan pendinginan cepat, namun pemindaian di atas 500 mm/s dan monitoring termal real-time
      sangat penting untuk mencegah deformasi.
    question: What is the maximum safe laser power density for cleaning platinum spark plug electrodes without melting or
      deforming them?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for platinum-rhodium thermocouples, using ~5 J/cm² fluence to selectively ablate carbon
      without altering the alloy. This non-contact method preserves calibration accuracy far better than abrasive techniques,
      which risk surface damage and compositional changes.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing carbon buildup from platinum-rhodium thermocouple wires in high-temperature
      applications?
  - answer: With optimal 5 J/cm² fluence and 50% overlap, laser cleaning minimizes microstructural changes in platinum. However,
      improper parameters can induce residual stress, increasing susceptibility to chemical attack. Post-cleaning inspection
      for micro-cracks is essential for chemical processing equipment integrity.
    question: Can laser cleaning create surface defects in platinum that lead to stress corrosion cracking in chemical processing
      equipment?
  - answer: Laser cleaning preserves over 99.9% of your platinum scrap, unlike chemical refining's significant material loss.
      With a 100W, 1064nm system operating at 5 J/cm², processing is dramatically faster. This method eliminates hazardous
      chemical costs while maintaining the metal's intrinsic purity, making it economically superior for high-value recovery.
    question: What are the economic considerations for laser cleaning platinum recovery scrap versus traditional refining
      methods?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for intricate platinum jewelry by reaching complex geometries that ultrasonic methods miss.
      With precise 50 μm spot control at 5 J/cm² fluence, it completely removes polishing compounds without embedding residues.
      This dry process maintains platinum's premium surface finish while significantly reducing cycle times in manufacturing.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to ultrasonic cleaning for removing polishing compounds from intricate platinum
      jewelry designs?
