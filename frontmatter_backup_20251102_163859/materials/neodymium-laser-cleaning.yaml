caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the neodymium surface shows heavy contamination with oily residues and fine dust particles clinging
    tightly. This rare-earth material reveals pitting and light oxidation, degrading its smooth finish and exposing underlying
    vulnerabilities.
  after: Laser cleaning restores neodymium surfaces by removing contaminants gently. The cleaned surface looks smooth and
    even, with its natural shine back in place. This method demonstrates excellent restoration quality, and material integrity
    stays strong—no cracks or weakening in the rare-earth structure. It suits general cleaning needs well.

  benefit: Chemical Waste Elimination
  description: Neodymium laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste by using high-peak-power pulses to ablate contaminants through
    photomechanical and photothermal processes, a method enabled by the material's high thermal conductivity which efficiently
    dissipates heat to prevent damage to the underlying rare-earth substrate. This non-contact, solvent-free process is critical
    in high-purity industries like semiconductor and medical manufacturing, preventing the generation of hazardous solvent
    waste streams.

    rare-earth oxides, as the low Vickers hardness (0.265 GPa) of the neodymium substrate necessitates a non-contact analysis
    to prevent surface deformation. The primary measurement challenge is differentiating the mass signal of the removed contaminant
    from the potential minor ablation of the soft neodymium base material.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning neodymium magnets is high-risk due to their extreme flammability and toxic fume generation from
      rare earth oxides. The 1064nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² can easily cause demagnetization from heat, unlike safer rust
      removal. You must use robust fume extraction and strictly control thermal input to prevent ignition.
    question: Is it safe to laser clean neodymium magnets, and what are the specific risks?
  - answer: For neodymium component cleaning, the optimal 1064 nm wavelength is ideal due to its high absorption. Use a low
      fluence near 5.1 J/cm² with high-frequency pulses to effectively remove oxides while preventing substrate damage. This
      approach leverages the material's thermal properties to ablate contaminants without generating excessive heat.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength and parameter settings for cleaning a neodymium component without damaging
      it?
  - answer: Removing Ni-Cu-Ni plating from NdFeB magnets is extremely challenging. The thermal threshold for magnetic degradation
      is only ~150°C, while achieving effective ablation requires careful fluence control near 5.1 J/cm². This high-risk process
      demands exceptional thermal management to prevent irreversible magnetic loss.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove the nickel-copper-nickel plating from a neodymium magnet without affecting the magnetic
      properties?
  - answer: Neodymium's low oxidation resistance of 0.15°C necessitates robust fume extraction. We use HEPA/ULPA filtration
      with activated carbon to capture heavy metal aerosols, ensuring airborne particulate levels remain below 1 mg/m³ for
      operator safety.
    question: How do you handle the toxic fumes generated when laser cleaning neodymium alloys?
  - answer: The black discoloration is surface oxidation from laser heating, as neodymium's low oxidation resistance (0.15°C)
      makes it highly reactive. This thin oxide layer typically doesn't affect magnetic performance. To minimize it, use a
      lower fluence near 5.1 J/cm² and a faster scan speed.
    question: Why does the surface of a neodymium magnet turn black or discolored after laser cleaning?
  - answer: Neodymium iron boron is pyrophoric, with fine particulates igniting spontaneously. We mitigate this using inert
      argon shielding at 1064 nm wavelength and maintaining strict housekeeping. A Class D extinguisher is mandatory for the
      reactive metal powders generated during laser cleaning.
    question: What is the risk of a fire when laser cleaning neodymium, and how is it mitigated?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² fluence effectively removes contaminants from neodymium, creating an ideal surface
      for recoating. However, its low oxidation resistance of 0.15°C requires meticulous thermal control with 50% beam overlap
      to prevent oxide formation that would impair adhesion.
    question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for preparing neodymium surfaces for recoating or re-plating?
  - answer: Neodymium's low oxidation resistance means a freshly laser-cleaned surface at 5.1 J/cm² will rapidly re-oxidize.
      This cleaning step must immediately precede applying a protective oil or coating within a controlled environment to
      prevent corrosion.
    question: How does the high reactivity and corrosion tendency of neodymium affect the laser cleaning process and post-cleaning
      handling?
  - answer: Cleaning pure neodymium requires extreme care due to its 0.265 HV softness and extreme pyrophoricity, demanding
      inert atmosphere shielding. In contrast, NdFeB magnets, while still hazardous, are more robust; their iron content alters
      fume composition and allows for slightly higher fluence near 5.1 J/cm², but both materials present a significant fire
      risk during laser processing.
    question: What are the key differences between laser cleaning a pure neodymium metal versus a common NdFeB magnet?
  - answer: While theoretically possible with precise 5.1 J/cm² fluence control, selectively ablating rust from pinholes without
      damaging the intact plating is extremely difficult. The magnet's low 0.265 HV hardness and 16.5 W/(m·K) conductivity
      make it highly susceptible to thermal damage, rendering this approach impractical for widespread corrosion.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to selectively remove corrosion (rust) from a sintered neodymium magnet without damaging
      the plating?
