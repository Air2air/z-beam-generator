caption:
  before: Microscopy shows ash wood's contaminated surface with dirt-clogged pores and uneven texture. Contaminants include
    fine dust and organic residues. Degradation features micro-cracks, hindering cleaning in optical laser applications.
  after: After cleaning ash wood surfaces, the material exhibits a restored smoothness and vibrant grain, free from residues
    that dull its appearance. This process upholds the wood's structural integrity, preventing fiber damage or discoloration.
    In furniture refinishing applications, such restoration ensures long-term durability and aesthetic appeal for everyday
    use.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Ash exhibits moderate thermal sensitivity, so your 5.1 J/cm² fluence must be carefully managed. The wood's porous
      structure aids heat dissipation, but exceeding ~200°C risks irreversible surface charring. With a 50% overlap, monitor
      for discoloration to stay below this critical temperature threshold.
    question: How does heat affect Ash during laser cleaning?
    word_count: 42
  - answer: Ash requires careful handling at 5.1 J/cm² due to its open grain structure. The 1064 nm wavelength is well-absorbed,
      but excessive fluence can compromise its integrity by removing softer earlywood.
    question: Is Ash fragile during laser cleaning?
    word_count: 30
  - answer: Yes, contaminants can definitely damage Ash's surface. At 5.1 J/cm², embedded particles can absorb laser energy,
      leading to localized overheating and potential etching or discoloration of the wood
    question: Can contaminants damage Ash's surface?
    word_count: 28
  - answer: Ash is selected for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and shock resistance, particularly in aerospace and
      musical instruments. Its open grain structure responds well to 1064 nm laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm², allowing for precise
      surface preparation without compromising structural integrity.
    question: Why is Ash chosen for its main applications?
    word_count: 40
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage Ash wood. At 5.1 J/cm², the 1064 nm wavelength can easily carbonize its porous
      surface. Monitor for darkening or a brittle texture, and always begin with a low fluence test on an inconspicuous area
      to establish a safe parameter window.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage Ash?
    word_count: 45
  - answer: After laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm², this wood requires immediate application of a protective oil or lacquer. Proper
      sealing prevents moisture absorption and preserves its open-grain structure. Store the component in a stable, climate-controlled
      environment to maintain its integrity.
    question: What care does Ash need after cleaning?
    word_count: 39
  - answer: Verify proper cleaning by examining the surface under 10x magnification for uniform, undamaged wood grain. With
      your 5.1 J/cm² fluence, the surface should appear consistent in color and texture, free from any residual contaminants
      or laser-induced discoloration.
    question: How can I verify Ash was cleaned properly?
    word_count: 37
  - answer: Ash's moderate density and hardness require careful fluence control around 5.1 J/cm². Its cellular structure can
      absorb energy efficiently, but excessive power must be avoided to prevent etching the wood grain.
    question: What physical properties make Ash unique for cleaning?
    word_count: 31
  - answer: Ash has low thermal conductivity, so heat accumulation is a primary concern. With your 5.1 J/cm² fluence, closely
      monitor the surface temperature to prevent charring. Ensure adequate cooling between passes to manage the energy deposited
      in the wood.
    question: What temperature considerations exist for Ash?
