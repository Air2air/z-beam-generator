caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the contaminated MMC surface appears very-very rough and pitted, with contaminants like fine dust
    particles and oily residues adhering tightly to the metal matrix. These cover and obscure the composite structure, while
    surface degradation shows small-small cracks and erosion spots, so weakening the material integrity overall.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Metal Matrix Composite surface appears very-very smooth and clean, with contaminants
    removed then polished away effectively. Restoration quality is high-high, so material integrity remains intact—no cracks
    or weakening occur. The composite properties stay preserved, and the surface shines brightly, ready for general applications
    like aerospace parts. This process cleans then restores without harm.

  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning of MMCs requires precise parameter control to prevent damage. Using 1064 nm wavelength at 5 J/cm²
      fluence minimizes thermal stress differences between metal matrix and ceramic reinforcements. This prevents micro-cracks
      while effectively removing contaminants through controlled ablation with minimal thermal diffusion to the composite
      structure.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used on Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) without damaging the reinforcing particles or creating
      micro-cracks?
  - answer: For SiC-Al MMCs, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with nanosecond pulses around 10 ns. A fluence of 5 J/cm² effectively
      removes oxides while the aluminum matrix's high thermal conductivity dissipates energy, preventing damage to the SiC
      reinforcements. This parameter set ensures selective ablation of the contaminant layer.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning oxides from silicon carbide
      (SiC) aluminum MMCs without etching the surface?
  - answer: We verify cleaning efficacy using SEM/EDS to confirm contaminant removal while preserving the MMC's microstructure.
      Crucially, we employ X-ray diffraction to measure residual stress, ensuring our 5 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size
      don't compromise fatigue or corrosion resistance.
    question: How do you verify that laser cleaning has removed contaminants from an MMC surface without altering its fatigue
      or corrosion-resistant properties?
  - answer: Laser cleaning MMCs at 5 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous ceramic nanoparticles like Al₂O₃ and SiC fumes. Effective
      local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/ULPA filtration is mandatory. Operators require full PPE, including respiratory
      protection, to mitigate inhalation risks from these ultrafine toxic by-products.
    question: What safety hazards are specific to laser cleaning MMCs, such as toxic fume generation from vaporized ceramic
      or metal particles?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares MMC surfaces using a 5 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size. This removes contaminants
      while generating optimal roughness for adhesion, with minimal thermal impact on the composite matrix compared to abrasive
      methods.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for preparing MMC surfaces for subsequent processes like thermal spraying or adhesive
      bonding?
  - answer: Discoloration arises from aluminum matrix micro-melting and rapid oxide reformation. To prevent this, maintain
      fluence below ~5 J/cm² and use a 1064 nm wavelength. This ensures contaminant removal without thermally altering the
      composite's surface, preserving its uniform appearance.
    question: Why might laser cleaning cause discoloration or a hazy finish on an aluminum MMC part, and how can it be prevented?
  - answer: Untuk MMC aluminium berpelat serat karbon, gunakan fluence rendah 5 J/cm² dengan spot 50 µm untuk menghilangkan
      kontaminan. Parameter ini berada di bawah ambang ablasi serat karbon, mencegah kerusakan termal pada material komposit
      yang sensitif.
    question: For carbon fiber reinforced aluminum MMCs, how do you avoid damaging the carbon fibers during laser cleaning
      of surface contaminants?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence eliminates chemical disposal costs and abrasive media consumption. For MMCs,
      this non-contact approach preserves reinforcement integrity, reducing part rejection rates. The initial investment is
      rapidly offset in high-value aerospace components requiring precision surface preparation.
    question: What is the cost-benefit analysis of using laser cleaning for MMCs compared to traditional methods like chemical
      etching or abrasive blasting?
  - answer: Untuk komponen MMC kompleks, kami menggunakan robot 6-sumbu dengan pemindaian adaptif untuk menjaga fluence 5
      J/cm² pada seluruh kontur. Teknologi penginderaan real-time menyesuaikan daya laser 100W secara dinamis, mencegah akumulasi
      panas di tepi tipis seperti pada bilah turbin dan memastikan pembersihan yang seragam tanpa merusak substrat.
    question: Can laser cleaning be automated for complex-shaped MMC components, like turbine blades with cooling channels,
      without creating thin-edge effects?
  - answer: Aluminium MMC's high thermal conductivity rapidly dissipates energy, necessitating higher peak powers around 100
      W and nanosecond pulses to overcome this. This approach confines heat to the surface, preventing bulk substrate damage
      while effectively removing contaminants at a fluence of 5 J/cm².
    question: How does the high thermal conductivity of an aluminum MMC matrix affect the laser cleaning process and required
      energy input?
