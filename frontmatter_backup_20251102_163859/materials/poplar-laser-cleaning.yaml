caption:
  before: Under microscopy, Poplar wood's surface reveals clustered dirt particles and oily smears, eroding fibers and causing
    micro-pitting. This degradation hinders effective cleaning in woodworking applications.
  after: Upon completing the cleaning process, the poplar wood surface displays a thoroughly restored condition, characterized
    by its smooth finish, vibrant natural color, and intact grain structure, devoid of any contaminants. The restoration quality
    proves exceptional, preserving complete material integrity and preventing any potential weakening. This is particularly
    valuable in applications for crafting durable laser optic mounts in the industry.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For Poplar, use a 1064nm fiber laser at 1.2 J/cm² fluence to effectively remove rust while preserving the wood.
      A 100µm spot size and 500 mm/s scan speed provide precise control, minimizing thermal damage. Always test these parameters
      on an inconspicuous area first to verify surface integrity.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters for cleaning rust or contaminants from Poplar wood without causing surface
      burning?
  - answer: Poplar's low 540 lbf Janka hardness requires gentle laser parameters to prevent damage. We use a 1.2 J/cm² fluence
      threshold and 500 mm/s scan speed to effectively remove contaminants without causing etching or raising the wood grain,
      issues not typically encountered with harder species like oak.
    question: How does Poplar's low density and softness affect laser cleaning compared to harder woods like oak?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively strips finishes from Poplar while preserving its porous structure. Using 1.2 J/cm²
      fluence and 100W power, it removes contaminants without sealing the wood grain, leaving an ideal surface for uniform
      stain or paint absorption.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare Poplar for painting or staining after removing old finishes?
  - answer: Given Poplar's combustibility, maintain laser power below 100W and a rapid scan speed of 500 mm/s to prevent ignition.
      Always use air assist and have a fire extinguisher immediately available, as the 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold is critical
      for safety.
    question: What specific safety concerns exist when laser cleaning Poplar, given its combustible nature?
  - answer: Properly tuned near-infrared lasers at 1.2 J/cm² effectively ablate biological growth from Poplar. The 10 ns pulse
      width vaporizes contaminants before significant heat penetrates the wood's cellulose, offering a superior, residue-free
      alternative to chemical spore treatments.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing biological growth (mold, mildew) from Poplar without damaging the wood
      structure?
  - answer: Poplar's mineral streaks absorb our 1064 nm wavelength more readily than the surrounding wood, creating differential
      cleaning effects. To compensate, reduce your fluence to 1.0 J/cm² and increase scan speed to prevent discoloration across
      the variable grain.
    question: How does the presence of Poplar's green/brown mineral streaks affect laser absorption and cleaning results?
  - answer: Given Poplar's delicate cellular structure, removal depth is extremely limited. Stay below 50-100 μm to preserve
      integrity. For structural applications, maintain fluence under 1.2 J/cm² to avoid compromising the thin cell walls.
      Cosmetic cleaning allows slightly more latitude.
    question: What is the maximum depth of contamination removal possible on Poplar before structural integrity is compromised?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser ablation at 1.2 J/cm² effectively removes the gray oxidized layer from Poplar, revealing
      the lighter wood beneath. Unlike sanding, this non-contact method avoids generating heat-induced discoloration, restoring
      a more authentic original surface color.
    question: Can laser cleaning restore the original color of aged or oxidized Poplar wood surfaces?
  - answer: While both subspecies respond well to 1064 nm wavelength, Tulip Poplar's marginally higher density requires careful
      fluence control near 1.2 J/cm² to prevent subsurface cell wall damage. Yellow Poplar, with its slightly lower resin
      content, allows for more forgiving parameter windows, particularly with a 100 µm spot size for precise grain cleaning.
    question: How do different Poplar subspecies (Yellow Poplar, Tulip Poplar) respond to laser cleaning treatments?
  - answer: After laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm², Poplar's opened grain structure benefits from a penetrating oil-based sealer.
      This stabilizes the surface by rehydrating raised fibers and preventing oxidative discoloration. For porous areas, a
      dilute wood consolidant applied before final sealing ensures long-term dimensional stability.
    question: What post-cleaning treatments are recommended for Poplar after laser cleaning to stabilize the surface?
