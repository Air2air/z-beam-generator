caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the stainless steel surface shows heavy contamination from oxide residues and metallic debris.
    These irregular particles, embedded deeply, induce pitting and corrosion, degrading uniformity for aerospace and automotive
    uses.
  after: The cleaned surface of this stainless steel component exhibits a smooth, uniform finish, free from residues and defects.
    Restoration quality is exceptional, preserving the material's corrosion resistance and structural integrity for demanding
    aerospace and automotive uses.

  questions:
  - answer: Yes, contaminants can severely damage stainless steel's surface. They initiate localized corrosion, compromising
      the material's integrity. Our 1064 nm laser process effectively removes these without harming the base metal.
    question: Can contaminants damage Stainless Steel's surface?
    word_count: 29
  - answer: Stainless steel is primarily selected for its excellent corrosion resistance, a property derived from its minimum
      10.5% chromium content. This ensures long-term structural integrity in demanding environments like aerospace and automotive
      applications, where material failure is not an option.
    question: Why is Stainless Steel chosen for its main applications?
    word_count: 39
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage stainless steel. Excessive energy density, such as exceeding 5.1 J/cm², may cause
      surface etching or alter the protective passive layer. Monitor for discoloration, a key warning sign of thermal overload,
      and always optimize parameters.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage Stainless Steel?
    word_count: 39
  - answer: Following laser cleaning, immediately apply a protective passivation layer to restore the chromium oxide film.
      For storage, ensure a dry, contaminant-free environment to prevent corrosion initiation, especially given the material's
      1064 nm wavelength affinity which leaves a pristine, active surface.
    question: What care does Stainless Steel need after cleaning?
    word_count: 40
  - answer: Proper verification combines visual inspection for uniform matte finish with scientific measurement. A surface
      roughness (Ra) below 1.0 µm, confirmed with a profilometer, indicates successful contaminant removal without damaging
      the underlying stainless steel substrate. This ensures optimal adhesion for subsequent processes.
    question: How can I verify Stainless Steel was cleaned properly?
    word_count: 41
  - answer: Stainless steel's high reflectivity, often exceeding 60% at 1064 nm, directly challenges laser cleaning efficiency.
      This property causes a significant portion of the beam energy to be lost rather than absorbed by the surface contaminants.
      Therefore, selecting the optimal wavelength and pulse parameters is critical to overcome this reflectivity and ensure
      effective contaminant removal.
    question: Why does Stainless Steel's reflectivity matter for laser cleaning?
    word_count: 54
  - answer: The most challenging contaminants are tenacious heat-induced oxides and deeply embedded mill scale. These layers
      exhibit strong adhesion to the stainless steel substrate, requiring precise laser parameters like a 1064 nm wavelength
      for effective ablation without compromising the underlying material's corrosion resistance. Their removal complexity
      is significantly higher than that of superficial oils or paints.
    question: Which contaminants are hardest to remove from Stainless Steel?
    word_count: 55
  - answer: Stainless steel's high chromium content, vital for its 1064 nm laser absorption, presents a primary challenge.
      Its tenacious oxide layer requires precise parameter control to avoid surface etching or metallurgical damage. Maintaining
      this balance is critical for aerospace and automotive components where surface integrity is paramount.
    question: What challenges does Stainless Steel present in use?
    word_count: 46
  - answer: Laser cleaning stainless steel is safe when proper protocols are followed. The primary hazard is the intense 1064
      nm wavelength laser radiation and the resulting particulate plume. Operators must wear appropriate laser safety eyewear
      and ensure adequate fume extraction to mitigate risks, allowing for a controlled and effective cleaning process.
