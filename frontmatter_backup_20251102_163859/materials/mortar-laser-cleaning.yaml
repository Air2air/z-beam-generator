caption:
  before: Under microscopic examination, the mortar surface reveals a heavily contaminated condition, with irregular pores
    clogged by fine particulate matter—likely dust, organic residues, and efflorescent salts. These contaminants, unevenly
    distributed, exhibit crystalline structures and amorphous aggregates, accelerating degradation through micro-cracks and
    pitting. This erosion, it weakens the masonry integrity over time.
  after: After laser cleaning, the mortar surface gleams smooth and restored, with pristine condition and full material integrity
    intact. Restoration quality excels, preserving original strength.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes mortar residue while preserving brick integrity. Using 1064 nm wavelength
      at 12.7 J/cm² fluence ensures selective ablation of the mortar. Optimal parameters like 500 mm/s scan speed and 50%
      overlap prevent thermal damage to the underlying masonry, making it ideal for sensitive restoration work.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove mortar residue from brickwork without damaging the bricks?
  - answer: For historical mortar on delicate stone, use low fluence around 12.7 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses at 10 ns. This
      provides controlled ablation, preserving the substrate. A 1064 nm wavelength and 50% beam overlap ensure uniform removal
      of traditional lime-based compositions without thermal damage.
    question: What laser parameters work best for cleaning historical mortar from delicate stone surfaces?
  - answer: Laser ablation at 12.7 J/cm² significantly reduces hazardous silica dust compared to mechanical grinding. However,
      the process still generates fine particulate, requiring local exhaust ventilation and respiratory protection to meet
      OSHA's permissible exposure limits for crystalline silica.
    question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when removing mortar containing silica?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² selectively ablates contaminants without chemical reactions, preserving the mortar's
      original composition. This prevents damaging salt crystallization and avoids pH shifts, ensuring superior long-term
      stability compared to chemical methods which can leave reactive residues.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the chemical composition of mortar surfaces compared to chemical cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can differentiate materials through selective ablation. At 12.7 J/cm², original mortar and
      modern repairs, with their distinct compositions, ablate at different rates. This allows precise removal of later cementitious
      additions while preserving the authentic, historical substrate.
    question: Can laser cleaning distinguish between original mortar and later repairs during restoration projects?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes mortar layers up to 2-3 mm thick per pass at 12.7 J/cm². For thicker residues,
      a multi-pass strategy is essential to avoid substrate damage, often requiring mechanical pre-cleaning for deposits exceeding
      5 mm.
    question: What's the maximum thickness of mortar residue that laser cleaning can effectively remove?
  - answer: Lime mortar's higher absorption at 1064 nm allows gentler cleaning near 12.7 J/cm². Denser Portland cement requires
      higher fluence, risking discoloration if its different mineralogy isn't accommodated with adjusted power and scan speed.
    question: How does mortar composition (lime-based vs. Portland cement) affect laser cleaning results?
  - answer: For large masonry facades, laser cleaning becomes cost-effective at scale despite higher initial equipment costs.
      Our 100W systems achieve 500 mm/s scan speeds with 12.7 J/cm² fluence, significantly reducing labor and eliminating
      abrasive disposal compared to traditional methods.
    question: Is laser cleaning cost-effective for large-scale mortar removal from masonry facades?
  - answer: In confined spaces like chimneys, implement aggressive fume extraction to manage hazardous mortar dust. The 1064
      nm wavelength poses significant reflection risks, requiring careful beam positioning. Continuously monitor oxygen levels
      and combustible gases to prevent atmospheric hazards.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning mortar from confined spaces like chimneys or tunnels?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² effectively strips contaminants and micro-roughens the mortar surface, creating an
      ideal adhesion profile for repointing. This method surpasses mechanical abrasion by preserving the substrate's integrity,
      ensuring superior bond strength for the new mortar without inducing micro-fractures.
    question: Can laser cleaning prepare mortar surfaces for repointing by creating better adhesion profiles?
  - answer: Moisture significantly increases steam generation risks during laser cleaning of mortar. For damp historical structures,
      I recommend reducing the fluence from 12.7 J/cm² and increasing the scan speed above 500 mm/s to manage thermal input.
      This adjustment helps prevent micro-fracturing while maintaining effective ablation on wet surfaces.
    question: How does moisture content in mortar affect laser cleaning efficiency and safety?
