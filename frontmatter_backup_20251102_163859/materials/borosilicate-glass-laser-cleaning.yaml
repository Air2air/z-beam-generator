caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the borosilicate glass surface reveals a contaminated condition with scattered fine dust particles
    and oily residues from handling. These contaminants form irregular clusters and streaks, adhering tightly and causing
    minor surface pitting along with reduced transparency. This degradation affects optical clarity, and cleaning restores
    integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the borosilicate glass surface regains its original clarity and smoothness. This process removes
    contaminants without altering the material's thermal stability or optical properties. The restoration quality is high,
    with no micro-cracks or haze, preserving integrity for everyday uses like labware and optics. It shows uniform shine,
    ready for reliable performance.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can safely remove coatings from borosilicate glass. Using a 1064 nm wavelength with a fluence
      below 2.5 J/cm² minimizes thermal shock risk due to the material's low expansion. Always begin with a test area, employing
      parameters like a 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent substrate damage.
    question: Can a laser cleaner remove coatings or contaminants from borosilicate glass without damaging or cracking the
      substrate?
  - answer: For borosilicate glass, a 1064nm wavelength is optimal. Its transmission profile allows controlled energy deposition
      at the surface, preventing internal damage. Maintain a fluence below 2.5 J/cm² with a 100µm spot size to effectively
      remove contaminants while avoiding micro-fractures in the sensitive glass substrate.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning borosilicate glass without causing internal
      damage or micro-fractures?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to avoid etching the borosilicate surface. Optimize your scan speed near 500
      mm/s and pulse overlap to prevent cumulative thermal effects that cause irreversible whitening. This damage permanently
      alters the glass structure.
    question: How do you prevent the formation of permanent whitening or 'frosting' on borosilicate glass during the laser
      cleaning process?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at ≤2.5 J/cm² fluence is safe for borosilicate glass. This avoids altering
      the refractive index or inducing stress birefringence in precision optics. Post-process inspection with polarimetry
      is recommended to verify surface integrity.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for precision borosilicate glass components like lenses, mirrors, or laboratory ware
      where surface integrity is critical?
  - answer: Borosilicate glass is susceptible to thermal fracture if fluence exceeds 2.5 J/cm². The process generates fine
      glass particulate, necessitating robust fume extraction. Operators must wear appropriate laser safety eyewear for the
      1064 nm wavelength.
    question: What are the specific safety hazards of laser cleaning borosilicate glass, such as shattering or harmful fumes?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes these contaminants from borosilicate glass. Using a fluence near 2.5 J/cm²,
      the process ablates deposits without thermal shock. This method typically leaves no residue, unlike chemical alternatives
      which can etch the surface.
    question: Can a laser effectively remove hard water stains, mineral deposits, or biological films from borosilicate glass
      surfaces?
  - answer: While borosilicate glass's low CTE provides inherent thermal shock resistance, the intense 2.5 J/cm² fluence from
      a pulsed laser can still generate steep thermal gradients. This localized stress, if parameters are mismatched, readily
      exceeds the material's fracture strength, leading to micro-cracking.
    question: How does the low coefficient of thermal expansion in borosilicate glass affect its susceptibility to thermal
      shock from a pulsed laser?
  - answer: For borosilicate glass, the safe fluence threshold is typically below 2.5 J/cm². This prevents substrate ablation
      while removing contaminants. Precise control of parameters like the 100 µm spot size is essential to stay beneath the
      material's damage limit.
    question: What is the maximum safe power density (fluence) threshold for cleaning borosilicate glass without causing ablation
      or damage to the base material?
  - answer: When performed correctly using 1064 nm wavelength and fluence below 2.5 J/cm², laser cleaning of borosilicate
      glass is typically a final-step process. No subsequent polishing is required to restore optical clarity, as the process
      effectively removes contaminants without inducing significant surface alteration that would impair transparency.
    question: Are there any post-laser cleaning treatments required for borosilicate glass, such as etching or polishing,
      to restore optical clarity?
  - answer: The haze often stems from recondensed contaminants or subsurface damage from excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm².
      Optimize your scan speed near 500 mm/s and pulse overlap to prevent this. For persistent films, a secondary wipe or
      a wavelength adjustment from 1064 nm may be necessary for a pristine finish.
    question: Why might a laser leave a hazy residue on borosilicate glass after cleaning, and how can this be eliminated?
