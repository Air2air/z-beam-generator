faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint and varnish from pine. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 1.8 J/cm² fluence
      and 90 W power prevents damage to the soft wood structure. Precise parameter control is essential to avoid charring,
      ensuring the delicate surface remains intact.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove old paint and varnish from pine wood without damaging the soft wood surface?
  - answer: For pine's lower density and resinous structure, I recommend a 1064 nm wavelength at 90 W average power. This
      setting, combined with a fluence of 1.8 J/cm², effectively removes contaminants while minimizing the charring risk associated
      with its softer composition compared to hardwoods.
    question: What laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best for cleaning pine compared to hardwoods?
  - answer: Pine's high resin content poses significant melting risks at excessive fluence levels. Maintain energy density
      below 1.8 J/cm² with 90W power to prevent redeposition. The 1064nm wavelength effectively vaporizes contaminants while
      managing thermal input to the wood substrate.
    question: How does the resin content in pine affect laser cleaning results and potential residue issues?
  - answer: With proper 1064nm wavelength and controlled 1.8 J/cm² fluence, laser cleaning safely preserves pine patina. Our
      90W power and 800mm/s scan speed selectively remove contaminants without damaging the delicate aged wood surface, maintaining
      its historical integrity.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for antique pine furniture where preserving the patina is important?
  - answer: Pine's high resin content releases terpenes when laser cleaned at 1064nm wavelength. You'll need industrial fume
      extraction rated for VOCs and respiratory protection. Continuous air monitoring for organic compounds is essential during
      processing.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning pine due to potential VOC emissions from resins?
  - answer: Properly calibrated laser parameters at 1.8 J/cm² and 90W power effectively remove contaminants from pine. This
      process enhances surface energy for superior bonding without compromising the delicate cellular structure of the wood
      fibers, ensuring a sound substrate.
    question: Can laser cleaning prepare pine surfaces for refinishing or bonding without creating a weakened surface layer?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior precision for pine restoration, operating at 90W average power to avoid charring.
      Unlike abrasive methods, it preserves delicate wood grain while removing contaminants at 800 mm/s, making it both faster
      and more environmentally sound than chemical alternatives.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sanding, chemical stripping) for pine restoration projects?
  - answer: Pine's low thermal threshold requires careful fluence control below 1.8 J/cm² to prevent charring. Utilize real-time
      monitoring to detect discoloration, adjusting the 90W power and 800 mm/s scan speed dynamically. This ensures uniform
      cleaning while preserving the wood's natural integrity.
    question: What are the risks of discoloration or charring when laser cleaning pine, and how can they be minimized?
  - answer: Properly configured laser parameters like 1.8 J/cm² fluence and 90W power avoid significant thermal penetration
      into pine's cellular structure. This preserves dimensional stability by preventing lignin softening and maintains the
      wood's inherent moisture equilibrium, ensuring no long-term warping or shrinkage from the cleaning process.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the dimensional stability or moisture content of pine wood?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively ablates biological contaminants from pine at 1.8 J/cm², eliminating surface spores
      without chemical residue. The 1064 nm wavelength and 90 W power ensure thorough decontamination while preserving the
      wood's structural integrity. This non-contact method significantly reduces the potential for future regrowth on the
      substrate.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing biological growth (mold, mildew) from pine surfaces?
