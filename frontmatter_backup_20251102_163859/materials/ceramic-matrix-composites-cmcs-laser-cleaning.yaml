caption:
  before: The microscopy image of the contaminated Ceramic Matrix Composite surface reveals adhered fine particulates and
    oily residues on fibers and matrix. These contaminants, sized 5-40 microns, form irregular clusters in pores and low spots,
    creating uneven coverage. This buildup causes surface degradation, including micro-cracks at interfaces and mild pitting.
    And it shows the need for cleaning to avoid further wear and preserve integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the CMC surface appears smooth and residue-free. It demonstrates high restoration quality,
    preserving material integrity.

  questions:
  - answer: For typical SiC/SiC composites, maintain fluence below 2-4 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. This range
      effectively removes oxides and carbon deposits while preserving the matrix integrity. The precise safe threshold depends
      on your specific fiber type and the initial surface contamination level.
    question: What is the maximum safe laser fluence (J/cm²) for cleaning CMCs without damaging the SiC matrix or fiber reinforcement?
  - answer: Using 1064nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence selectively ablates carbonaceous soot while preserving Yb₂SiO₅ EBC
      integrity. Maintain 500 mm/s scan speed with 50μm spot size to ensure contaminant removal without thermal alteration.
      Post-process verification via optical microscopy confirms surface preservation.
    question: How do I remove environmental contaminants like carbonaceous soot from CMC turbine blades without altering the
      underlying protective EBC (Environmental Barrier Coating)?
  - answer: For CMC laser cleaning, 1064nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence provides optimal absorption balance. This effectively
      removes contaminants while preserving the SiC matrix and carbon fibers, preventing thermal damage to the composite's
      critical constituents.
    question: What laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm, or 10.6μm) is most effective for cleaning CMCs, and why?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can induce micro-cracks in CMCs from thermal shock. Using nanosecond pulses at 10 ns and a
      fluence of 5 J/cm² minimizes this risk by limiting heat diffusion. Process monitoring is essential to detect any subsurface
      thermal stress damage.
    question: Can laser cleaning induce micro-cracks or thermal stress damage in the CMC's brittle ceramic matrix?
  - answer: The 5 J/cm² fluence generates nanoparticles of SiC and carbon fibers requiring HEPA filtration. Maintain industrial
      hygiene with proper ventilation and respiratory protection for operators handling these ultrafine byproducts from CMC
      laser processing.
    question: What are the best practices for handling the nanoparticles and vapors generated during laser cleaning of CMCs,
      especially those with carbon fibers?
  - answer: Properly tuned 1064 nm laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² minimally alters CMC topography. It can slightly increase surface
      roughness by opening sealed pores, which often enhances coating adhesion but may require NDE signal compensation for
      accurate inspection.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface roughness and porosity of a CMC, and what is the impact on subsequent
      re-coating or re-inspection?
  - answer: Laser depainting at 5 J/cm² effectively removes organic coatings from CMCs with minimal substrate interaction.
      The primary risk is incomplete paint pyrolysis, which can leave carbonaceous residues not found with mechanical methods.
      Proper parameter control is essential to avoid this contamination.
    question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for depainting CMC components, and what are the risks of leaving residual
      chemical contaminants from the paint?
  - answer: For complex CMC airfoils, precise 3D beam delivery is paramount. Galvo scanners enable high-speed contour following
      at 500 mm/s, while closed-loop monitoring with LIBS prevents hot spots by ensuring the 5 J/cm² fluence remains uniform,
      thus avoiding thermal damage.
    question: For automated laser cleaning of complex CMC geometries (like airfoils), how critical is beam delivery and scanning
      control to ensure uniform cleaning without hot spots?
  - answer: The fundamental difference lies in carbon's high 1064nm absorption and oxidation risk versus SiC's higher ablation
      threshold near 5 J/cm². C/C cleaning demands inert gas assist and lower fluence, while SiC/SiC withstands more aggressive
      ns-pulse parameters. This dictates entirely different laser strategies for each composite system.
    question: What is the fundamental difference in laser interaction between a SiC/SiC CMC and a C/C (Carbon-Carbon) composite,
      and how does that change the cleaning strategy?
  - answer: For CMC surface integrity verification after laser cleaning at 5 J/cm², fluorescent penetrant inspection effectively
      reveals micro-cracks. Pulsed thermography is also highly reliable for detecting subsurface thermal alterations, as it
      maps thermal effusivity changes from potential heat-affected zones without contact.
    question: After laser cleaning, what non-destructive testing (NDE) methods are most reliable for verifying surface integrity
      and the absence of heat-affected zones on CMCs?
