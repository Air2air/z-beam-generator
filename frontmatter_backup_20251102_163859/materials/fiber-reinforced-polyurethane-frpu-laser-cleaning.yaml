caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the FRPU surface shows heavy contamination by fine dust particles and oily residues. This degradation
    manifests in micro-cracks and pitting, compromising integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane surface appears smooth and uniform, free from contaminants
    and oxidation layers. This restoration quality excels, preserving the composite's structural integrity with fibers intact
    and the polyurethane matrix undamaged. No thermal degradation occurs, ensuring the material retains its original mechanical
    properties for reliable applications in demanding environments.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For FRPU cleaning, utilize nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with a fluence near 2.5 J/cm². This wavelength is well-absorbed
      by contaminants and the polyurethane matrix, while the short 10 ns pulse duration and 100 W power limit heat diffusion,
      preserving the sensitive fiber reinforcement from thermal degradation.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning contaminants from FRPU
      without damaging the fiber reinforcement?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² with a defocused 100 µm spot to prevent polyurethane melting. Utilize high scan
      speeds exceeding 500 mm/s and multiple passes to remove material incrementally. This approach manages thermal input,
      avoiding the sub-surface delamination that occurs with excessive energy density.
    question: When laser cleaning FRPU, how do I avoid melting the polyurethane surface or causing sub-surface delamination?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power safely removes contaminants from FRPU.
      This preserves the fiber-matrix interface far better than abrasives, but post-process validation through bond strength
      testing is essential to confirm structural integrity.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for FRPU, or will it degrade the material's mechanical properties and structural integrity?
  - answer: Lasing FRPU at 2.5 J/cm² generates toxic isocyanates and hydrogen cyanide gas, plus fine carbon fiber particulates.
      You require a HEPA filter for the particles and a chemical scrubber for the gases, with sufficient airflow to manage
      these specific byproducts.
    question: What specific safety hazards are created when lasing FRPU, and what extraction/filtration is required?
  - answer: Yes, lasers excel at removing release agents from FRPU composites. Using low fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with a 100
      µm spot size, we can vaporize silicone residues without damaging the fiber reinforcement, ensuring a perfectly clean
      surface.
    question: Can a laser effectively remove release agents and mold residues from FRPU composite parts after demolding?
  - answer: Laser cleaning with 1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence selectively ablates the polyurethane matrix without
      damaging fibers, unlike blasting methods. This prevents media embedment, ensuring a pristine surface for superior adhesion
      with no secondary waste, despite requiring greater initial investment.
    question: How does laser cleaning FRPU compare to traditional methods like dry ice blasting or plastic media blasting
      for adhesion preparation?
  - answer: For FRPU, first verify a visually clean surface without fiber damage. Quantitatively, use dyne pens to confirm
      surface energy above 42 mN/m. The definitive validation, however, is a lap shear test on a coupon processed at 2.5 J/cm².
    question: What is the best way to validate the success of a laser cleaning process on FRPU before bonding or painting?
  - answer: Carbon fibers' high conductivity and strong absorption at 1064 nm necessitate a cautious approach. We must use
      a lower fluence, around 2.5 J/cm², and a rapid 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent scorching. Conversely, glass fibers are
      more transparent, allowing for greater energy density without compromising their structural integrity.
    question: Why is the fiber type (glass vs. carbon) in FRPU critical for selecting a laser cleaning strategy?
  - answer: The high elasticity of polyurethane provides inherent resistance to mechanical shock damage. The primary risk
      is thermal degradation, which is mitigated using nanosecond pulses at 100 W and a 1064 nm wavelength. With ultra-short
      pulses, excessive fluence above ~2.5 J/cm² can induce stress-confinement effects, risking micro-cracking at the fiber-matrix
      interface.
    question: Does the high elasticity and toughness of polyurethane make it more or less susceptible to laser-induced shock
      damage?
