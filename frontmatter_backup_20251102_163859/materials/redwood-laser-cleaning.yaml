caption:
  before: Under microscopy, redwood's surface shows heavy-heavy contamination by dirt particles and organic residues. These
    cling tightly, degrading wood with pitting and discoloration. Surface appears rough-rough and damaged.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the redwood surface appears very-very smooth and clean, with dirt removed then contaminants
    eliminated thoroughly. The process restores natural grain patterns beautifully, so the wood looks renewed and vibrant.
    Material integrity remains intact, no burns or cracks appear, and strength stays preserved for long-lasting applications.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk redwood yang lunak, gunakan fluence 1.2 J/cm² dengan spot 100 µm untuk menghilangkan kontaminan tanpa merusak
      struktur selulernya. Kecepatan scan 500 mm/s dan overlap 50% memastikan pembersihan seragam, sementara pulsa 10 ns memberikan
      kontrol ablasi yang optimal untuk material berpori ini.
    question: What laser settings work best for cleaning redwood without damaging the soft wood surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively eliminates mildew and biological growth from redwood surfaces through precise ablation
      at 1.2 J/cm². This process removes spores and surface contaminants without damaging the wood's lignin structure. Unlike
      chemical treatments, this dry method prevents immediate regrowth by thoroughly sanitizing the substrate at a microscopic
      level.
    question: How effectively does laser cleaning remove mildew and biological growth from redwood decks and siding?
  - answer: With optimal 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 1064 nm wavelength, laser cleaning selectively removes contaminants while preserving
      redwood's protective tannins. This non-abrasive process maintains the wood's inherent weather resistance, ensuring long-term
      durability for architectural and marine applications.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect redwood's natural weather resistance and tannin content?
  - answer: Laser cleaning with 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size effectively removes contaminants from redwood without
      hydrating the fibers. This non-contact process avoids grain raising, unlike sanding, creating an ideal porous surface
      for uniform stain or sealant adhesion.
    question: Can laser cleaning prepare redwood surfaces for staining or sealing without raising the grain?
  - answer: Redwood's natural resins require robust fume extraction due to hazardous particulates. At the optimal 1.2 J/cm²
      fluence, use local ventilation with HEPA/activated carbon filtration to capture volatile organic compounds and sub-micron
      aerosols generated during ablation.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning redwood due to its resin content?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² selectively ablates grayed surface contaminants from Redwood, preserving the sound
      wood beneath. This non-contact method offers superior control over traditional abrasives, safeguarding the material's
      historical integrity with 100 µm precision.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods for restoring aged redwood structures?
  - answer: Deep iron-tannate staining poses significant challenges as the 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold can be insufficient
      for complete removal. Embedded metallic particles may reflect the 1064 nm wavelength, risking localized thermal damage
      and requiring meticulous parameter adjustment to avoid wood substrate charring.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for redwood with deep staining or embedded metal particles?
  - answer: Dengan parameter optimal seperti fluence 1,2 J/cm² dan spot size 100 μm, pembersihan laser pada redwood dapat
      mempertahankan warna alaminya. Pengaturan termal yang tepat mencegah perubahan warna dengan mengablasikan kontaminan
      sebelum panas meresap ke serat kayu.
    question: Does laser cleaning alter the color of redwood or cause any discoloration effects?
  - answer: Redwood's poor thermal conductivity, typically 0.1 W/m·K, severely restricts heat dissipation, elevating charring
      risks. We mitigate this by using a 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold and rapid 500 mm/s scanning to limit energy deposition.
      This strategy prevents thermal degradation in the low-density cellular structure.
    question: How does redwood's low thermal conductivity affect laser cleaning efficiency and heat buildup?
  - answer: Clear heartwood responds well to 1.2 J/cm² fluence, effectively removing contaminants without damage. Knotty areas,
      being denser and resinous, require careful power modulation below 100 W to prevent localized charring. The 1064 nm wavelength
      is optimal for lignin interaction, ensuring uniform cleaning across these distinct grain structures.
    question: What laser cleaning results can be expected on different redwood grades (clear vs. knotty)?
