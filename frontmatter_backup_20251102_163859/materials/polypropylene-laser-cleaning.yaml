caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the polypropylene surface appears dirty-dirty and uneven, covered by oily contaminants that stick-stick
    tightly and gritty particles that scatter-scatter across it. These make the texture rough-rough, so degradation shows
    as small-small pits and micro-cracks, weakening the plastic then reducing its smoothness for cleaning applications.
  after: The polypropylene surface is cleaned very-very thoroughly by the laser process, restoring smoothness and shine. Material
    integrity remains intact, appearing pristine and undamaged.

  questions:
  - answer: Ya, polypropylene dapat dibersihkan dengan laser secara aman menggunakan parameter terkontrol. Dengan fluence
      1.2 J/cm² dan spot size 100 µm pada 1064 nm, kontaminan terangkat tanpa melelehkan substrat yang titik leburnya 160-170°C.
      Kecepatan scan 500 mm/s dan overlap 50% mencegah akumulasi panas berlebih.
    question: Can you safely laser clean polypropylene without melting or damaging the surface?
  - answer: Polypropylene's transparency at 1μm wavelengths necessitates indirect cleaning via contaminant absorption. We
      recommend 1064 nm lasers with 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 100 μs dwell time to selectively remove surface layers without substrate
      degradation. This approach leverages the material's own optical properties for safe, effective cleaning.
    question: What laser wavelength is most effective for cleaning contaminants from polypropylene?
  - answer: For silicone-based release agents on polypropylene, we utilize a 1064 nm wavelength with a fluence of 1.2 J/cm².
      This effectively ablates the thin organic film while the 100 µm spot size ensures the substrate remains undamaged. Verification
      is then performed via FTIR spectroscopy.
    question: How do you remove mold release agents from polypropylene surfaces with laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning significantly enhances polypropylene's adhesion through surface activation. At optimal 1.2 J/cm²
      fluence and 1064 nm wavelength, we achieve improved wettability that often surpasses traditional flame treatment for
      subsequent bonding applications.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the adhesion properties of polypropylene for subsequent painting or bonding?
  - answer: Polypropylene decomposition at 1.2 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous aldehydes like formaldehyde. You must employ
      local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/activated carbon filtration. Operators require appropriate respiratory protection
      to mitigate inhalation risks from these ultrafine particulates and gases.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning polypropylene due to fume generation?
  - answer: Ya, laser cleaning dengan fluence 1.2 J/cm² pada 1064 nm secara bersamaan meningkatkan energi permukaan polipropilena.
      Perlakuan ini menciptakan mikro-roughness yang meningkatkan adhesi cetak, setara dengan korona namun lebih terkontrol
      dan bebas kimia.
    question: Can laser cleaning create surface modifications that improve polypropylene's printability?
  - answer: Polypropylene's yellowing stems from thermal degradation when fluence exceeds ~1.2 J/cm², causing polymer chain
      scission. Optimize parameters like a 500 mm/s scan speed to minimize localized heating and prevent oxidation that leads
      to chromophore formation.
    question: Why does polypropylene sometimes turn yellow or brown after laser cleaning?
  - answer: Untuk membersihkan oksidasi dari polipropilena tua, gunakan fluens rendah 1.2 J/cm² dengan panjang gelombang 1064
      nm. Parameter ini mengatasi embrittlement dengan meminimalkan penetrasi termal, secara efektif menghilangkan lapisan
      terdegradasi UV tanpa merusak substrat.
    question: What laser parameters work best for removing oxidation layers from aged polypropylene?
  - answer: Filler materials like talc significantly alter absorption dynamics, requiring parameter adjustments to prevent
      selective removal. For filled PP composites, reduce fluence to approximately 1.0 J/cm² from the standard 1.2 J/cm² to
      avoid exposing underlying particles while still achieving effective surface cleaning. This prevents undesirable surface
      morphology changes.
    question: How does the presence of fillers (talc, glass) in polypropylene composites affect laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares polypropylene for ultrasonic welding by removing surface contaminants without
      creating bonding barriers. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 1.2 J/cm² fluence ensures optimal surface energy modification.
      This controlled process enhances joint strength by preserving the polymer's integrity while achieving the required cleanliness.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for preparing polypropylene surfaces for ultrasonic welding?
