caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the oak surface displays a contaminated condition with irregular topography. Adherent particles—fine
    dust grains and oily residues—cluster within the porous wood fibers, measuring 1-10 microns in size and exhibiting amorphous
    shapes. This buildup fosters surface degradation, manifesting as micro-fissures, fiber erosion, and localized discoloration,
    which undermine the material's structural integrity for cleaning and manufacturing applications.
  after: The cleaned oak surface gleams smoothly, its natural grain restored vividly. Quality restoration preserves full material
    integrity without compromise.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² using a 100W source at 500 mm/s to ablate charring without carbonizing the lignin.
      A 100µm spot size provides precise control. Employ multiple low-power passes, rather than a single aggressive one, to
      manage thermal input and preserve the wood's integrity.
    question: How do I remove black charring from oak when laser cleaning without damaging the wood?
  - answer: For oak beam cleaning, I recommend nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with approximately 100 W average power.
      Begin testing with a fluence near 2.5 J/cm² and a 100 µm spot size. This combination effectively ablates soot while
      minimizing thermal diffusion into the wood substrate, preventing charring.
    question: What are the ideal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning soot and dirt from an oak
      beam?
  - answer: With precise 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot control, a laser can selectively ablate paint from antique oak.
      This preserves the patina by avoiding the differential erosion of soft earlywood that plagues mechanical methods.
    question: Can a laser safely remove old paint or varnish from an antique oak piece without altering the patina?
  - answer: UV laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² effectively deactivates surface mold spores on oak. However, it cannot eliminate
      deep hyphal growth, necessitating a combined biocidal treatment. Crucially, proper HEPA filtration is mandatory to manage
      aerosolized spores during the process.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for decontaminating mold or biological growth from oak in heritage conservation?
  - answer: Oak laser cleaning at 100W and 2.5 J/cm² generates hazardous aldehydes and acetic acid fumes. Fine wood dust also
      presents a significant explosion risk, necessitating robust fume extraction with P3 respiratory protection and integrated
      spark detection systems for operator safety.
    question: What specific safety hazards exist when laser cleaning oak, especially regarding fumes and particulates?
  - answer: Oak's alternating porous and dense grain causes differential ablation at our 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This can create
      a slightly textured surface, requiring multi-directional passes at 500 mm/s to ensure uniform cleaning across the entire
      grain structure.
    question: How does the density and grain structure of oak affect the laser cleaning process and final result?
  - answer: Laser cleaning on oak is inherently superficial, removing just 10-50 microns per pass. Exceeding this risks degrading
      the cellular structure. The key is using a low fluence, around 2.5 J/cm², and limiting passes to preserve the wood's
      integrity.
    question: What is the maximum depth of material removal possible on oak with a laser before structural integrity is compromised?
  - answer: Success is confirmed via colorimetry showing ΔE<5 for acceptable lightening, avoiding charring. Microscopy must
      reveal intact cell walls at 100µm resolution. Maintain 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power to prevent surface roughening.
    question: How do I evaluate the success of a laser cleaning treatment on oak, and what are the acceptable post-treatment
      changes?
  - answer: The white residue is micro-charred lignin from excessive fluence above the 2.5 J/cm² threshold. To prevent this,
      reduce your laser power or increase the scan speed beyond 500 mm/s. A final, gentle pass at lower energy will effectively
      remove the remaining ash without damaging the oak substrate.
    question: Why does my laser leave a white, ashy residue on the oak surface after cleaning, and how can I prevent it?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for delicate oak artifacts like historical furniture or violins, where our 2.5 J/cm² fluence
      and 100 µm spot size remove contaminants with micron-level precision. This prevents substrate loss, unlike aggressive
      soda blasting, making it ideal for high-value conservation where the original surface integrity is paramount.
    question: For which applications is laser cleaning oak most suitable compared to traditional methods like soda blasting
      or chemical stripping?
