caption:
  before: Microscopy of the untreated marble surface reveals heavy contamination by atmospheric particulates and organic biofilms,
    manifesting as irregular dark encrustations and diffuse soiling. Visible degradation includes surface pitting, microcracks
    from weathering, and localized discoloration, indicating compromised structural integrity and aesthetic deterioration.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy illustrates a highly restored marble surface, with thorough ablation of contaminants
    exposing the underlying calcite crystalline structure and intergranular porosity. The treatment achieves superior restoration
    quality, featuring smooth topography, intact material integrity, minimal thermal discoloration, and preserved microstructural
    features without substrate damage or excessive ablation.

  questions:
  - answer: Ya, laser dapat membersihkan graffiti dari marmer dengan aman menggunakan parameter spesifik seperti fluence 2.5
      J/cm² dan spot size 100 µm. Kunci suksesnya adalah menghindari kejutan termal dengan pulse duration 10 ns. Selalu uji
      di area tersembunyi dulu untuk memastikan tidak terjadi perubahan warna atau etching pada permukaan batuannya.
    question: Can you safely use a laser cleaner to remove graffiti from marble without damaging the surface?
  - answer: For white Carrara marble, 1064nm at 2.5 J/cm² is typically optimal. However, darker marbles and stains absorb
      shorter wavelengths more efficiently, often necessitating 532nm to prevent thermal damage to the calcite substrate.
      The choice hinges on the specific contaminant's absorption profile versus the stone's mineral composition.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning different types of marble (e.g., white
      Carrara vs. dark marble)?
  - answer: We utilize a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² to selectively ablate black crusts. This fluence vaporizes iron oxides
      and biological growth without exceeding the marble's damage threshold, thus preventing subsurface calcination and shadowing.
    question: How do you remove black crusts or biological growth (lichens, algae) from marble with a laser without leaving
      a shadow or etch mark?
  - answer: Untuk mencegah yellowing pada Marmer, gunakan fluence rendah ~2.5 J/cm² dan pulsa nanodetik. Parameter ini mengablasikan
      kontaminan tanpa mentransfer panas berlebih yang mengubah kimia permukaan batu kapur sensitif ini.
    question: What are the critical laser parameters (fluence, pulse duration, repetition rate) to avoid the yellowing or
      burning of marble during cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes soot using 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 50 kHz pulses. However, acidic smoke residues
      can permanently etch the marble surface; this chemical alteration is irreversible and cannot be remedied by the laser
      process.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing smoke or fire damage from marble surfaces, and what are the limitations?
  - answer: Water assist serves as a heat sink, suppressing plasma shielding and preventing thermal shock in the marble at
      our typical 2.5 J/cm² fluence. Concurrently, an air jet removes ablation debris from the beam path, ensuring consistent
      cleaning efficiency and protecting the delicate calcite matrix.
    question: Why is water or air-assist often used during laser cleaning of marble, and what are the pros and cons?
  - answer: Veins and fissures concentrate stress, requiring reduced fluence below 2.5 J/cm². Avoid prolonged exposure on
      these features to prevent spalling, using a wider spot size and faster scan speeds to manage thermal input effectively.
    question: How does the presence of veins, fissures, and existing cracks in marble affect the laser cleaning strategy?
  - answer: Laser ablation of marble at 2.5 J/cm² generates fine calcium carbonate dust and hazardous contaminants. A HEPA-filtered
      extraction system is mandatory to capture these sub-100µm particles, and respiratory PPE must always be worn by the
      operator.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning marble, especially in terms of fume extraction?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² ablates contaminants but inherently creates a micro-rough, matte surface on marble.
      The original polished finish is not restored by the laser process itself. To regain the desired gloss, subsequent mechanical
      polishing steps like honing are required after the surface has been thoroughly cleaned.
    question: Can laser cleaning restore the polished finish of marble, or will it leave a matte surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior selectivity, removing black crust at ~2.5 J/cm² while preserving the marble's historical
      patina. This non-contact method eliminates chemical residue risks from poultices and provides precise control with a
      100 µm spot, preventing substrate damage. It is ideal for delicate heritage surfaces where material integrity is paramount.
    question: For a conservator, what are the advantages of laser cleaning marble monuments over traditional methods like
      poultices or chemical gels?
