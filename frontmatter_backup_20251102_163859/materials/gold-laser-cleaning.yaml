caption:
  before: Scanning electron microscopy reveals the gold surface prior to laser cleaning as heavily contaminated with irregular
    particulates, including carbonaceous residues and fine oxide inclusions, adhering to the polycrystalline matrix. Visible
    degradation manifests as micro-pitting and localized etching along grain boundaries, with surface roughness amplified
    by adherent debris, compromising the metallic luster and structural integrity under high magnification.
  after: Post-laser cleaning, optical and electron microscopy illustrate a restored gold surface exhibiting uniform cleanliness
    and preserved material integrity. The polycrystalline structure remains intact without ablation-induced defects, showcasing
    smooth grain facets and minimal residual roughness. Enhanced reflectivity and absence of contaminants confirm effective
    restoration, maintaining the substrate's original morphological characteristics.

  questions:
  - answer: Ya, sistem laser dapat membersihkan emas tanpa merusak substratnya. Dengan fluensi di bawah 0.8 J/cm² dan panjang
      gelombang 532 nm, kontaminasi permukaan seperti sulfida perak dapat dihilangkan secara selektif. Konduktivitas termal
      emas yang tinggi memungkinkan pendinginan cepat, mencegah pelelehan material dasar saat menggunakan pulsa nanodetik.
    question: Can a laser cleaning system remove tarnish or surface contamination from gold without damaging the underlying
      material?
  - answer: For delicate gold surfaces, the optimal wavelength is 532 nm green light. Gold's reflectivity drops significantly
      at shorter wavelengths, enabling efficient ablation at lower fluence near 0.8 J/cm². This approach minimizes thermal
      damage risks to sensitive substrates like historical artifacts or electronics, ensuring precise contaminant removal.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning delicate gold surfaces, such as historical
      artifacts or electronics contacts?
  - answer: We utilize a 532 nm wavelength for enhanced gold absorption, minimizing hazardous reflections. Critical safety
      measures include optical isolators and beam dumps to protect the 15 W laser source from back-reflected energy. Operators
      must wear wavelength-specific eyewear.
    question: How do you prevent the high reflectivity of gold from causing safety issues or damaging the laser cleaning equipment
      itself?
  - answer: Laser cleaning can remove oxidation from gold alloys, but selective ablation of alloying elements like copper
      is a concern. Using a 532 nm wavelength at 0.8 J/cm² fluence minimizes this risk, preserving the surface composition
      and color integrity.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for removing oxidation or fire scale from gold alloys (like 14k or 18k gold) after
      heat treatment or soldering?
  - answer: Discoloration and matte finishes arise from micro-melting and surface roughening if fluence exceeds ~0.8 J/cm².
      Maintaining the specular reflection of polished gold requires precise control of parameters like the 50 µm spot size
      and 500 mm/s scan speed to avoid altering its microstructure.
    question: What are the risks of causing discoloration or a matte finish on a polished gold surface during laser cleaning?
  - answer: Ya, ablasi laser dapat secara selektif menghilangkan lapisan emas tanpa merusak substrat. Dengan fluence terkontrol
      sekitar 0.8 J/cm² dan panjang gelombang 532 nm, proses ini sangat efektif untuk aplikasi perbaikan PCB dan pemulihan
      logam mulia dari komponen elektronik bekas.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to selectively de-plate gold from a substrate without harming the base material?
  - answer: Lower karat gold's higher copper content increases oxidation risk during laser cleaning. We must reduce the fluence
      below 0.8 J/cm² and adjust the 50 kHz repetition rate to prevent thermal damage to the more susceptible alloy, ensuring
      a pristine surface.
    question: How does the karat (purity) of gold affect the laser cleaning process and the parameters required?
  - answer: Untuk memastikan tidak ada penipisan yang terukur, gunakan white light interferometry untuk mengukur topografi
      permukaan secara non-destruktif. Proses harus dijalankan di bawah fluens ablasi emas 0.8 J/cm² pada 532 nm untuk hanya
      menghilangkan kontaminan.
    question: What is the recommended method for verifying that a laser cleaning process on gold has not caused any measurable
      material loss or thinning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning gold at 532 nm wavelength and 0.8 J/cm² fluence can aerosolize hazardous alloying elements like
      nickel or cadmium. Proper fume extraction with HEPA/ULPA filtration is mandatory. Always consult the specific alloy's
      MSDS to identify and mitigate risks from vaporized contaminants.
    question: Are there any hazardous fumes generated when laser cleaning gold, especially from alloys or surface contaminants?
  - answer: Gold's exceptional thermal conductivity and chemical inertness require distinct laser parameters compared to reactive
      metals like silver. We must carefully control the fluence near 0.8 J/cm² and use a 532 nm wavelength to ensure efficient
      energy coupling for contaminant removal without causing microstructural damage to the substrate.
    question: Why might a laser cleaning process that works on other precious metals (like silver) not be directly applicable
      to gold?
