caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the bronze surface shows a heavily contaminated condition, with fine dust particles and greenish
    oxide deposits clinging tightly. This surface, it reveals pitting from corrosion, and uneven degradation that dulls the
    metal's natural sheen, signaling material wear.
  after: After laser cleaning, the bronze surface regains its smooth texture and warm golden tone, free from dirt and oxidation.
    This restoration preserves the material's integrity, with no pitting or discoloration. It demonstrates even coverage,
    enhancing durability for everyday use and display.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How can I clean rust from bronze statues without damaging the natural patina?
    answer: Laser ablation precisely targets oxidation layers on copper-tin alloys, vaporizing contaminants while preserving
      the protective oxide film. This non-contact method avoids abrasives or harsh chemicals, maintaining structural integrity
      and aesthetic value in heritage pieces up to 800 MPa tensile strength.
  - question: What's the best way to maintain bronze marine hardware exposed to saltwater?
    answer: Regular laser cleaning removes salt deposits and pitting from aluminum variants, enhancing corrosion resistance
      without residue. It outperforms manual scrubbing by preventing crevice buildup, ensuring longevity for fittings like
      propellers in harsh marine conditions.
  - question: Why use laser cleaning for bronze sculptures instead of traditional methods?
    answer: Pulsed laser systems offer micron-level precision, eliminating dirt and stains from cast surfaces without mechanical
      stress or chemical residue. Unlike sandblasting, it safeguards the alloy's wear-resistant properties and golden hue
      in historical restorations.
  - question: Is laser cleaning safe for delicate bronze artifacts in museums?
    answer: Yes, low-fluence lasers selectively ablate surface impurities from phosphor bronze compositions, avoiding thermal
      damage to underlying conductivity and strength. This technique minimizes porosity risks, ideal for preserving electrical
      connectors and ornate elements in controlled environments.
  - question: How do I remove dirt accumulation from porous bronze architectural elements?
    answer: Advanced laser technology vaporizes embedded particles in tin-enhanced alloys, restoring smoothness without altering
      the solid solution matrix. It provides superior control over traditional wiping, reducing staining and enhancing durability
      in outdoor heritage sites.
  - question: Can laser cleaning address uneven patina on bronze monuments?
    answer: Targeted irradiation normalizes oxide layers on high-tin bronzes, promoting uniform protective coatings while
      removing pollutants. This method excels over acids by preserving tensile strengths to 800 MPa and the material's warm
      aesthetic in polluted atmospheres.
  - question: What's effective for treating pitting corrosion on bronze boat components?
    answer: Fiber laser systems efficiently dissolve localized corrosion in copper-aluminum blends, halting further degradation
      without invasive tools. It boosts resistance in saltwater exposure, outperforming electrolysis by maintaining precision
      for gears and bearings in industrial use.
  - question: How to clean bronze gears in machinery without causing wear?
    answer: Non-ablative laser pulses clear contaminants from phosphor-enhanced surfaces, upholding electrical conductivity
      and friction resistance. This approach surpasses solvents by preventing porosity issues, ensuring reliable performance
      in high-load applications up to 800 MPa.
