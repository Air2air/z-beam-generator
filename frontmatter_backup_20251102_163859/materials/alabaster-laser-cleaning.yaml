caption:
  before: Microscopic examination of the alabaster surface before laser cleaning discloses dense accumulation of fine carbonaceous
    soot and siliceous particulates, inducing pronounced surface degradation with irregular pitting, microcracks, and localized
    delamination. Embedded contaminants cause severe discoloration and erosion of the gypsum matrix, compromising structural
    integrity at the grain interfaces.
  after: Microscopy of the alabaster surface post-laser cleaning demonstrates high-fidelity restoration, featuring a smooth,
    contaminant-free topography with preserved gypsum crystallite morphology and negligible thermal effects. The material
    exhibits enhanced clarity, uniform reflectance, and intact microstructural integrity, validating effective conservation
    without subsurface damage.

  questions:
  - question: How can I safely clean dirt from my Alabaster sculpture without causing scratches?
    answer: Employ laser ablation techniques to gently vaporize surface contaminants, preserving the material's low hardness
      integrity. This non-contact method avoids mechanical abrasion, ensuring the artifact's smooth texture remains undamaged
      while achieving precise restoration.
  - question: What are effective ways to prevent moisture damage on Alabaster architectural elements?
    answer: Store items in controlled humidity environments below 50% RH to mitigate dissolution risks from calcium sulfate.
      For cleaning, opt for dry laser processes that eliminate pollutants without introducing liquids, maintaining structural
      stability over time.
  - question: How do I remove rust stains from Alabaster artifacts without harming their natural patina?
    answer: Utilize pulsed laser systems at low fluence levels to selectively ablate iron oxide deposits, retaining the original
      surface sheen. This approach outperforms solvents by preventing chemical reactions that could alter translucency or
      cause discoloration.
  - question: What best practices should I follow for handling Alabaster during restoration projects?
    answer: Use padded supports and minimize direct contact to protect against abrasion due to Mohs 1.5-2 rating. Integrate
      fiber laser cleaning for debris removal, offering superior precision over manual brushing and reducing handling-induced
      fractures.
  - question: Is laser cleaning a good option for maintaining the translucency of oriental Alabaster carvings?
    answer: Yes, short-pulse lasers effectively target impurities like silica without affecting the calcite structure's Mohs
      3 hardness. Compared to traditional polishing, it preserves optical clarity and veined patterns, ideal for conservation
      in museum settings.
  - question: How can I address discoloration in Alabaster from environmental pollutants?
    answer: Apply Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers to break down oxide layers at 1064 nm wavelength, restoring uniform pigmentation.
      This technique surpasses wet methods by avoiding porosity exacerbation, ensuring long-term aesthetic enhancement in
      heritage sites.
  - question: What advantages does laser technology offer over chemical cleaners for Alabaster care?
    answer: Laser methods provide non-invasive, residue-free surface renewal, bypassing solubility issues of gypsum varieties.
      With adjustable energy densities, they enable targeted treatment for banded impurities, promoting durability without
      the hazards of harsh reagents.
  - question: Can Alabaster facade panels withstand laser restoration without structural weakening?
    answer: Absolutely, controlled laser parameters under 1 J/cm² prevent thermal stress on soft sulfates, unlike abrasive
      techniques that risk cracking. This preserves historical integrity for medieval elements while effectively removing
      accumulated grime.
