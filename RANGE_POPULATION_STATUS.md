## üîç Sample Research Findings

### Metal Surface Roughness (VALIDATED)
**Source**: Engineering ToolBox (authoritative engineering reference)

| Material Type | Min (Œºm) | Max (Œºm) | Confidence |
|--------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Drawn copper/brass/aluminum | 1.0 | 2.0 | High |
| Stainless steel (turned) | 0.4 | 6.0 | High |
| Stainless steel (bead blasted) | 1.0 | 6.0 | High |
| Commercial steel | 45.0 | 90.0 | High |
| Galvanized steel | 150.0 | 150.0 | High |

**Recommended Category Range**: 0.4 - 150 Œºm Ra (for industrial metals)

This demonstrates the methodology working correctly!

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Continue Web Searches** for high-priority properties:
   ```
   Priority Order:
   1. ablationThreshold (all categories) - MOST CRITICAL
   2. reflectivity (metal, ceramic, glass)
   3. surfaceRoughness (complete remaining categories)
   4. oxidationResistance (metal, composite)
   5. porosity (ceramic, wood, stone)
   ```

2. **Document Findings** in `data/PublishedRanges_Research.yaml`:
   - Add authoritative sources with URLs
   - Include confidence scores
   - Note measurement conditions
   - Cross-reference multiple sources

3. **Create Integration Script** `scripts/apply_published_ranges.py`:
   - Read published ranges from research file
   - Update Categories.yaml with validated ranges
   - Update frontmatter files where published data supersedes sibling calculations
   - Generate report showing improvements

4. **Validation Step**:
   - Compare published ranges vs sibling-calculated ranges
   - Flag significant discrepancies for review
   - Update confidence scores

### Future Enhancements

5. **Automate Research** (optional):
   - Create API integration with materials databases
   - Automate cross-referencing
   - Build citation management system

6. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regular updates as new research published
   - Community contribution system
   - Peer review process for range validation

## üéì Research Query Templates

### For Each Property-Category Combination:

**Template 1 - General Range**:
```
"[property name] range [category name] materials typical values"
```

**Template 2 - Academic**:
```
"[property name] variation [category name] site:scholar.google.com"
```

**Template 3 - Industry Database**:
```
"[property name] [category name] site:matweb.com OR site:asminternational.org"
```

**Template 4 - Standards**:
```
"ASTM [property name] [category name] standard specification"
```

### Example for Ablation Threshold - Metals:
1. "laser ablation threshold metals typical values J/cm¬≤"
2. "metal ablation fluence range nanosecond pulse site:scholar.google.com"
3. "laser damage threshold metallic materials site:nist.gov"
4. "laser processing metals threshold ASTM standard"

## ‚ú® Innovation Achievement

We've successfully established a **three-tier, science-first approach** to material property ranges:

1. **Categories.yaml** (authoritative published ranges) ‚úÖ
2. **Deep Web Search** (validated research from multiple sources) ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
3. **Sibling Calculation** (fallback only when no published data exists) ‚úÖ

This ensures our laser cleaning content is backed by **authoritative scientific data** rather than just calculated from our limited material database.

## üéØ Call to Action

**Ready to proceed with systematic web searches for the high-priority properties!**

The framework is in place, methodology is approved, and we have a working example with metal surface roughness. Next phase: comprehensive research for the top 10 properties across all major categories.
