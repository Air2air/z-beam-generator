# FAQ Voice & Variation Enhancement Implementation

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for deployment  
**Impact**: Fixes critical voice accuracy issues (29% ‚Üí 80%+ target)

---

## üéØ Updates Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced FAQ Generator** (`components/faq/generators/faq_generator.py`)

#### Voice Enforcement Improvements
- **Expanded voice indicators** - Added 14 indicators per author (was 8)
  - Taiwan: Added `empirical`, `rigorous`, `framework`, `theoretical`, `structured`, `research-based`
  - Italy: Added `finesse`, `craftsmanship`, `artisan`, `mastery`, `heritage`
  - Indonesia: Added `cost-effective`, `reliable`, `versatile`, `clear`
  - USA: Added `breakthrough`, `revolutionary`, `next-generation`, `maximize`, `high-performance`

#### Stronger Prompt Enforcement
```python
# NEW: Explicit voice marker injection
prompt += f"\n\nüéØ VOICE ENFORCEMENT - {author_country} Author ({author_name}):\n"
prompt += f"REQUIRED: Use these {author_country}-specific voice indicators naturally:\n"
prompt += f"  ‚Ä¢ Voice markers: {', '.join(voice_words[:8])}\n"
prompt += "  ‚Ä¢ Include at least 2-3 of these indicators organically\n"
prompt += f"  ‚Ä¢ Write from {author_name}'s perspective and expertise\n"
```

#### Variation Requirements
```python
# NEW: Anti-repetition guidance
prompt += "\n\nüìä VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:\n"
prompt += "‚Ä¢ Vary your opening - avoid starting every answer the same way\n"
prompt += "‚Ä¢ Rotate technical parameter phrasing\n"
prompt += "‚Ä¢ Use different sentence structures and transitions\n"
prompt += "‚Ä¢ Include material-specific context and applications\n"
```

#### Voice-Specific Phrasing Examples
- New `_get_voice_guidance()` method provides context-appropriate examples
- Injects opening phrases, technical phrasing, and transitions per author
- Guides AI toward authentic voice without being prescriptive

### 2. **Variation Patterns Configuration** (`components/faq/config/variation_patterns.yaml`)

Comprehensive 250+ line configuration file providing:

#### Question Starter Alternatives
Reduces "What are the..." from 140 uses to <50:
```yaml
parameters:
  - "What are the optimal parameters"
  - "Which parameters work best"
  - "How should I configure"
  - "What parameter settings deliver"
```

#### Technical Parameter Variations
Reduces "1064 nm wavelength" from 95 uses to <30:
```yaml
wavelength:
  "1064 nm":
    - "1064 nm wavelength"
    - "1.064 Œºm laser light"
    - "near-infrared wavelength at 1064 nanometers"
    - "1064nm Nd:YAG emission"
```

#### Voice-Specific Phrase Templates
Provides authentic phrasing for each author:

**Taiwan (Yi-Chun Lin)**:
```yaml
taiwan:
  opening:
    - "Systematic analysis demonstrates that"
    - "Research-based methodology indicates"
    - "Empirical studies show that"
  technical:
    - "precisely calibrated at"
    - "systematically optimized for"
    - "empirically validated approach"
```

**Italy (Alessandro Moretti)**:
```yaml
italy:
  opening:
    - "The sophisticated approach involves"
    - "Refined technique demonstrates"
    - "Elegant methodology reveals"
  technical:
    - "elegantly configured at"
    - "meticulously optimized for"
    - "sophisticated parameter selection"
```

**Indonesia (Ikmanda Roswati)**:
```yaml
indonesia:
  opening:
    - "Practical experience shows that"
    - "Efficient approach involves"
    - "Sustainable methodology demonstrates"
  technical:
    - "practically optimized at"
    - "efficiently configured for"
    - "cost-effective technique"
```

**United States (Todd Dunning)**:
```yaml
united_states:
  opening:
    - "Innovative technology enables"
    - "Cutting-edge approach achieves"
    - "Advanced methodology delivers"
  technical:
    - "optimized for peak performance at"
    - "advanced configuration featuring"
    - "cutting-edge parameter selection"
```

### 3. **Batch Regeneration Script** (`scripts/batch_faq_voice_fix.py`)

Automated workflow for fixing voice accuracy issues:

#### Features
- Analyzes current voice accuracy per author
- Identifies materials with voice mismatches
- Prioritizes regeneration (Taiwan ‚Üí Italy ‚Üí USA ‚Üí Indonesia)
- Batch processes with progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic
- Post-regeneration verification

#### Usage
```bash
python3 scripts/batch_faq_voice_fix.py
```

#### Process
1. Analyzes 132 materials for voice consistency
2. Reports accuracy by author country
3. Asks for confirmation before starting
4. Regenerates FAQs in priority order
5. Provides success/failure statistics
6. Recommends next steps (export ‚Üí deploy)

#### Expected Timeline
- ~90 materials need regeneration
- ~3-5 minutes per material (DeepSeek API)
- Total: 4.5-7.5 hours for complete batch

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Test Enhanced Generator (Day 1)
```bash
# Test with one material per author
python3 run.py --faq "Beryllium"  # Taiwan
python3 run.py --faq "Alabaster"  # Italy
python3 run.py --faq "Aluminum"   # USA
python3 run.py --faq "Breccia"    # Indonesia
```

Verify:
- ‚úÖ Voice indicators present (2-3 per answer)
- ‚úÖ Varied question starters
- ‚úÖ Rotated technical phrasing
- ‚úÖ Word count 20-60 words

### Phase 2: Batch Regeneration (Days 2-3)
```bash
# Run batch script
python3 scripts/batch_faq_voice_fix.py

# Answer "yes" to confirmation prompt
# Wait 4.5-7.5 hours for completion
```

Monitor:
- Progress per material
- Success/failure counts
- Voice accuracy improvements

### Phase 3: Verification (Day 3)
```bash
# Re-run FAQ analysis
python3 << 'EOF'
import yaml
from collections import Counter

with open('data/Materials.yaml', 'r') as f:
    materials = yaml.safe_load(f)['materials']

# Check voice accuracy
voice_indicators = {
    'Taiwan': ['systematic', 'methodology', 'precisely', 'comprehensive'],
    'Italy': ['sophisticated', 'elegant', 'refined', 'meticulous'],
    'Indonesia': ['practical', 'efficient', 'sustainable', 'effective'],
    'United States': ['innovative', 'performance', 'advanced', 'cutting-edge']
}

# Analyze voice matches
for material_name, material_data in materials.items():
    # ... validation logic
    pass

print("‚úÖ Voice accuracy verification complete")
EOF
```

### Phase 4: Export & Deploy (Day 4)
```bash
# Export to frontmatter
python3 -m components.frontmatter.core.trivial_exporter

# Deploy to production
python3 run.py --deploy

# Commit changes
git add data/Materials.yaml content/frontmatter/
git commit -m "Fix FAQ voice consistency across 90 materials"
git push
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Batch regeneration may hit DeepSeek rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Script includes 2-second delays between materials
   - **Fallback**: Can process in smaller batches if needed

2. **Generation Variance**: AI may not always include all voice indicators
   - **Mitigation**: Requires 2-3 indicators minimum, not all
   - **Acceptance**: 80%+ accuracy target, not 100%

3. **Configuration Loading**: Variation patterns file must exist
   - **Mitigation**: Generator works without it (degraded mode)
   - **Recovery**: File included in commit
