title: Lead Laser Cleaning
subtitle: When laser cleaning lead, the main challenge comes from its low melting
  point that makes surfaces vulnerable to heat damage during the process, so I've
  seen the best results by using lower power settings to gently remove contaminants
  while preserving the material's dense structure for shielding applications, but
  always monitor closely to avoid any softening or deformation at the end.

description: 'When laser cleaning lead, watch its tendency to melt easily. Start with
  very low power right away. I''ve seen surfaces puddle if you push too hard.


  This works when you keep pulses short and focused. Lead''s softness means it responds
  quickly to heat. So, gentle passes bring back the shine without damage.


  Tends to reflect a lot of laser energy too. That makes cleaning slower than on darker
  metals. Adjust by overlapping scans a bit more.


  Its density holds heat in spots, so move the beam steadily. I''ve found this prevents
  warping on thin pieces.


  Avoid rushing with high speed. Lead can smear or oxidize if you do. Instead, do
  multiple light passes. That clears rust and grime safely, especially on old roofing
  or shields. In my experience, it restores heritage items perfectly this way.'

caption:
  before: You see thick layers of grime and rust clinging tightly to the lead surface.
    Dark spots and uneven buildup scatter across the rough texture. This mess hides
    the metal's true form under a dull, patchy coat.
  after: Start with the laser pass to strip away all that residue quickly. Now the
    surface gleams smooth and even without any scars. Fresh lead shines clearly, free
    from old stains and debris.
