title: Bronze Laser Cleaning
material_description: When laser cleaning bronze, make sure you adjust settings carefully because its lower melting point sets it apart from tougher ferrous metals like steel and can lead to surface damage if heat builds up too quickly, so this demands precise control to strip away corrosion or patina effectively while preserving the material's natural durability for applications in architecture and marine use.

caption:
  before: Looking closely at the bronze surface before cleaning, I see a layer of dull, patchy grime covering everything. Dark streaks and tiny clumps stick tightly to the metal, making it look uneven and worn. Scratches and small pits scatter across, roughening the whole view.
  after: After the laser treatment, the bronze surface appears smooth and brightly metallic. The grime vanishes completely, revealing a uniform shine without any streaks. Now, the texture looks even and clear, free from those old pits
faq:
- question: What makes bronze a reliable metal for industrial use?
  answer: Bronze is a copper-tin alloy we often turn to in manufacturing. It holds up well in tools, fittings, and even marine parts because it resists corrosion. Density sits around 8.8 g/cm³, so pieces stay sturdy without getting too heavy. Porosity hovers at about 0.5%, which means fewer voids that could trap dirt or weaken the structure.
- question: How do we clean bronze with lasers?
  answer: Laser cleaning works great here. You apply roughly 100 W power to remove rust or grime from surfaces. This method clears contaminants fast and leaves the base metal intact. It suits restoration projects, like old statues, without harsh chemicals. Just watch the settings to avoid heating the alloy too much.
