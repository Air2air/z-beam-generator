caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the bronze surface shows a heavily contaminated condition,
    with fine dust particles and greenish oxide deposits clinging tightly. This surface,
    it reveals pitting from corrosion, and uneven degradation that dulls the metal's
    natural sheen, signaling material wear.
  after: After laser cleaning, the bronze surface regains its smooth texture and warm
    golden tone, free from dirt and oxidation. This restoration preserves the material's
    integrity, with no pitting or discoloration. It demonstrates even coverage, enhancing
    durability for everyday use and display.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How can I clean rust from bronze statues without damaging the natural
      patina?
    answer: Laser ablation precisely targets oxidation layers on copper-tin alloys,
      vaporizing contaminants while preserving the protective oxide film. This non-contact
      method avoids abrasives or harsh chemicals, maintaining structural integrity
      and aesthetic value in heritage pieces up to 800 MPa tensile strength.
  - question: What's the best way to maintain bronze marine hardware exposed to saltwater?
    answer: Regular laser cleaning removes salt deposits and pitting from aluminum
      variants, enhancing corrosion resistance without residue. It outperforms manual
      scrubbing by preventing crevice buildup, ensuring longevity for fittings like
      propellers in harsh marine conditions.
  - question: Why use laser cleaning for bronze sculptures instead of traditional
      methods?
    answer: Pulsed laser systems offer micron-level precision, eliminating dirt and
      stains from cast surfaces without mechanical stress or chemical residue. Unlike
      sandblasting, it safeguards the alloy's wear-resistant properties and golden
      hue in historical restorations.
  - question: Is laser cleaning safe for delicate bronze artifacts in museums?
    answer: Yes, low-fluence lasers selectively ablate surface impurities from phosphor
      bronze compositions, avoiding thermal damage to underlying conductivity and
      strength. This technique minimizes porosity risks, ideal for preserving electrical
      connectors and ornate elements in controlled environments.
  - question: How do I remove dirt accumulation from porous bronze architectural elements?
    answer: Advanced laser technology vaporizes embedded particles in tin-enhanced
      alloys, restoring smoothness without altering the solid solution matrix. It
      provides superior control over traditional wiping, reducing staining and enhancing
      durability in outdoor heritage sites.
  - question: Can laser cleaning address uneven patina on bronze monuments?
    answer: Targeted irradiation normalizes oxide layers on high-tin bronzes, promoting
      uniform protective coatings while removing pollutants. This method excels over
      acids by preserving tensile strengths to 800 MPa and the material's warm aesthetic
      in polluted atmospheres.
  - question: What's effective for treating pitting corrosion on bronze boat components?
    answer: Fiber laser systems efficiently dissolve localized corrosion in copper-aluminum
      blends, halting further degradation without invasive tools. It boosts resistance
      in saltwater exposure, outperforming electrolysis by maintaining precision for
      gears and bearings in industrial use.
  - question: How to clean bronze gears in machinery without causing wear?
    answer: Non-ablative laser pulses clear contaminants from phosphor-enhanced surfaces,
      upholding electrical conductivity and friction resistance. This approach surpasses
      solvents by preventing porosity issues, ensuring reliable performance in high-load
      applications up to 800 MPa.
