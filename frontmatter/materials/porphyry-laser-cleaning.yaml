caption:
  before: Under microscopy, contaminated porphyry surface appears very-very rough
    and degraded. Fine dust particles and organic residues cling tightly, so pitting
    forms and natural shine dims.
  after: The cleaned porphyry surface appears very-very smooth and clean. Restoration
    quality is high, so material integrity stays intact. Process removes stains then
    restores original texture without damage.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk membersihkan pertumbuhan biologis pada Porphyry, gunakan laser 1064
      nm dengan fluens 12.7 J/cm² dan daya 100 W. Durasi pulsa nanodetik ini mengablasikan
      organik secara selektif, menghindari kejutan termal pada matriks kristalin feldspar
      yang sensitif. Pengaturan ini mempertahankan integritas mineral tanpa menyebabkan
      perubahan warna.
    question: What are the best laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning biological growth like lichen and moss from Porphyry without damaging
      the crystalline matrix?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes black gypsum crusts from Porphyry at
      12.7 J/cm², but risks forming altered mineral phases like anhydrite. The 1064
      nm wavelength minimizes sub-surface damage to phenocrysts. Verify complete removal
      using Raman spectroscopy to detect residual sulfates without surface etching.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove black gypsum crusts from Porphyry
      surfaces, and what are the risks of leaving behind altered mineral phases?
  - answer: Porphyry's variable crystal distribution and porous groundmass create
      inconsistent absorption of our 12.7 J/cm² fluence. This demands constant power
      and scan speed adjustments to prevent uneven cleaning, as denser areas resist
      ablation while pores may overheat.
    question: How does the variable composition and porosity of Porphyry affect the
      consistency of laser cleaning results across a single slab or facade?
  - answer: Thermal cracking risk is significant due to differing expansion coefficients
      between feldspar phenocrysts and groundmass. Use nanosecond pulses at 12.7 J/cm²
      to confine thermal stress, preventing micro-fractures in the crystalline structure.
      This regime ensures controlled contaminant ablation.
    question: Is there a risk of thermal cracking or micro-fracturing in Porphyry's
      large feldspar phenocrysts during laser cleaning, especially with high-power
      or continuous-wave lasers?
  - answer: For Porphyry's pitted surface, I recommend combining low-pressure water
      rinsing with soft nylon brushing after laser ablation at 12.7 J/cm². This effectively
      dislodges trapped particles from vesicles without the risk of micro-fracture
      propagation that air abrasion can cause.
    question: What is the recommended method for post-laser cleaning residue removal
      from the rough, often pitted, surface of Porphyry?
  - answer: At 12.7 J/cm² fluence, ns-pulsed 1064 nm lasers effectively remove contaminants
      without altering Porphyry's purplish-red hematite pigments. This wavelength's
      mineral-specific interaction preserves the stone's chromatic integrity, as demonstrated
      in European monument conservation projects.
    question: For historical Porphyry monuments, does laser cleaning cause any irreversible
      color changes, particularly to the characteristic purplish-red hues?
  - answer: Validasi keberhasilan pada Porphyry memerlukan spektrofotometri untuk
      memastikan warna asli tercapai dan mikroskopi untuk memeriksa integritas permukaan.
      Pengujian ultrasonik juga efektif mendeteksi delaminasi sub-permukaan yang tak
      kasat mata akibat paparan fluence 12.7 J/cm².
    question: How do we validate the success of a laser cleaning process on Porphyry?
      What non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are most effective?
  - answer: Laser cleaning preserves Porphyry's delicate arrises and patina, unlike
      abrasive methods. With precise parameters like a 12.7 J/cm² fluence threshold,
      it selectively removes contaminants without chemical runoff or substrate damage,
      ensuring the stone's integrity.
    question: Why might laser cleaning be preferred over chemical or abrasive methods
      for sensitive Porphyry restoration?
  - answer: Porphyry's metal oxide content requires HEPA filtration for hazardous
      aerosols like crystalline silica. At 100 W and 1064 nm wavelength, proper fume
      extraction is critical. Operators must wear P3-rated respiratory protection
      to mitigate exposure to these fine particulates generated during the ablation
      process.
    question: What are the specific safety considerations (e.g., fume extraction,
      PPE) when laser cleaning Porphyry, given its potential metal oxide content?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² effectively prepares Porphyry by removing
      contaminants to create a micro-rough, chemically clean surface that enhances
      coating adhesion. However, careful parameter control is essential to prevent
      surface glazing, which would reduce the permeability required for subsequent
      consolidation treatments. The 1064 nm wavelength is particularly suitable for
      this stone's mineralogy.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a Porphyry surface for subsequent
      treatments like consolidation or protective coatings?
