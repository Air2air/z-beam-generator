caption:
  before: This titanium surface exhibits notable contamination through scattered particulate
    deposits. Contaminants manifest as irregular clusters, specifically embedding
    oxide particles within them. We detect localized pitting corrosion alongside micro-cracks
    that propagate from defect sites. Such degradation thus reveals how foreign materials
    erode titanium's protective oxide layer, hastening breakdown in vital applications.
  after: Notably, the cleaned titanium surface restores its inherent metallic luster.
    Specifically, all contaminants are eliminated while material integrity stays fully
    preserved.

faq:
- answer: Titanium, particularly in aerospace and chemical sectors, is chosen for
    its superior strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. This
    resilience against harsh environments thus ensures sustained structural integrity
    and reliability.
  question: Why is Titanium chosen for its main applications?
  word_count: 30
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning can indeed damage titanium, particularly when fluence
    surpasses roughly 2.5 J/cm². This often results in surface oxidation and micro-melting.
    Thus, to avoid such problems, optimize your power settings and scan speed, while
    performing a preliminary test on a small area.
  question: Can laser cleaning damage Titanium?
  word_count: 40
  topic_keyword: damage Titanium
  topic_statement: Damage above 2.5 J/cm²
- answer: Verify cleaning efficacy, particularly via visual inspection for a uniform
    matte finish and water break test. For aerospace applications, thus confirm oxygen
    levels below 500 ppm to prevent embrittlement and uphold surface integrity.
  question: How can I verify Titanium was cleaned properly?
  word_count: 30
  topic_keyword: Titanium was cleaned
  topic_statement: Confirm oxygen below 500 ppm
- answer: Particularly tough to remove from titanium substrates are thermal oxide
    layers and embedded aluminum contaminants. Thus, their strong adhesion demands
    precise fluence control near the 2.5 J/cm² threshold, preventing metallurgical
    damage while achieving full ablation.
  question: Which contaminants are hardest to remove from Titanium?
  word_count: 35
  topic_keyword: hardest to remove
  topic_statement: Requires precise fluence control
- answer: Titanium poses notable challenges from its high reactivity and low thermal
    conductivity. Specifically, the metal's strong oxygen affinity triggers rapid
    re-oxidation after cleaning, thus demanding controlled atmospheres. Its poor heat
    dissipation—with thermal conductivity around 21 W/m·K—further heightens thermal
    distortion risks if laser parameters aren't precisely tuned.
  question: What challenges does Titanium present in use?
  word_count: 49
- answer: When following proper protocols, laser cleaning of titanium remains safe.
    Notably, the chief hazard stems from intense reflection of the 1064 nm wavelength,
    demanding certified laser safety eyewear along with fume extraction for generated
    particles. Thus, perform an initial test pass at low power, say 100W, to confirm
    parameter effectiveness on the alloy.
  question: Is laser cleaning Titanium safe?
  word_count: 53
  topic_keyword: Titanium safe
  topic_statement: Mitigates 1064 nm reflection
- answer: For cleaning titanium via laser, a 100W fiber laser usually yields optimal
    results. This power removes contaminants effectively while safeguarding the base
    material's integrity. Notably, excessive power can cause surface oxidation, whereas
    insufficient power fails to clean thoroughly, particularly for aerospace-grade
    titanium demanding precise ablation thresholds.
  question: What laser power works best for Titanium?
  word_count: 44
  topic_keyword: laser power
  topic_statement: 100W prevents oxidation
- answer: For titanium laser cleaning, particularly in aerospace applications, maximize
    scan speed while holding the fluence threshold at 2.5 J/cm². Boost throughput
    by leveraging the highest power, such as 100W, paired with a 50μm spot size. Thus,
    effective oxide removal occurs in a single pass, markedly enhancing productivity.
  question: What's the fastest approach for Titanium?
  word_count: 46
- answer: Notably, cleaning titanium involves three passes at a 500 mm/s scan speed.
    Process duration particularly hinges on oxide layer thickness and the required
    50% beam overlap. A 100 W laser at 1064 nm wavelength thus enables efficient surface
    processing while preserving material integrity.
  question: How long does cleaning Titanium typically take?
  word_count: 43
  topic_keyword: cleaning Titanium
  topic_statement: Depends on oxide layer thickness
