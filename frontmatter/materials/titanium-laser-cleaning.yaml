caption:
  before: This titanium surface shows significant contamination with scattered particulate
    deposits. The contaminants appear as irregular clusters and reveal embedded oxide
    particles. We observe localized pitting corrosion and micro-cracks propagating
    from defect sites. The surface degradation demonstrates how foreign materials
    compromise titanium's protective oxide layer, leading to accelerated material
    breakdown in critical applications.
  after: The cleaned titanium surface reveals its original metallic luster. All contaminants
    are removed, and the material integrity remains fully intact.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Titanium is selected for aerospace and chemical applications due to its
      exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and outstanding corrosion resistance. Its
      ability to withstand aggressive environments ensures long-term structural integrity
      and reliability.
    question: Why is Titanium chosen for its main applications?
    word_count: 30
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage titanium if the fluence exceeds approximately
      2.5 J/cm². This can cause surface oxidation and micro-melting. To prevent this,
      always optimize your power settings and scan speed, and conduct a preliminary
      test on a small area.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage Titanium?
    word_count: 40
  - answer: Verify cleaning efficacy through visual inspection for uniform matte finish
      and water break test. For aerospace applications, confirm oxygen levels remain
      below 500 ppm to prevent embrittlement, ensuring surface integrity.
    question: How can I verify Titanium was cleaned properly?
    word_count: 30
  - answer: Thermal oxide layers and embedded aluminum contaminants present the greatest
      removal challenge from titanium substrates. Their strong adhesion requires precise
      fluence control near the 2.5 J/cm² threshold to avoid metallurgical damage while
      ensuring complete ablation.
    question: Which contaminants are hardest to remove from Titanium?
    word_count: 35
  - answer: Titanium's high reactivity and low thermal conductivity present significant
      challenges. Its strong affinity for oxygen causes rapid re-oxidation after cleaning,
      requiring controlled atmospheres. The material's poor heat dissipation, with
      a thermal conductivity around 21 W/m·K, also elevates the risk of thermal distortion
      if laser parameters are not meticulously managed.
    question: What challenges does Titanium present in use?
    word_count: 49
  - answer: Laser cleaning titanium is safe when proper protocols are followed. The
      primary hazard is the intense 1064 nm wavelength reflection, requiring certified
      laser safety eyewear and fume extraction for any generated particles. Always
      conduct a test pass at a low power setting, such as 100W, to verify parameter
      efficacy on the specific alloy.
    question: Is laser cleaning Titanium safe?
    word_count: 53
  - answer: For titanium laser cleaning, a 100W fiber laser typically provides optimal
      results. This power effectively removes contaminants while preserving the base
      material's integrity. Excessive power risks surface oxidation, while insufficient
      power fails to achieve thorough cleaning, especially for aerospace-grade titanium
      requiring precise ablation thresholds.
    question: What laser power works best for Titanium?
    word_count: 44
  - answer: For titanium laser cleaning, maximize scan speed while maintaining the
      2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold. Optimize throughput by utilizing the highest available
      power, such as 100W, and a 50μm spot size. This strategy ensures effective oxide
      removal in a single pass, significantly boosting productivity for aerospace
      components.
    question: What's the fastest approach for Titanium?
    word_count: 46
  - answer: Cleaning titanium typically requires 3 passes at 500 mm/s scan speed.
      The process duration depends on oxide layer thickness and the required 50% beam
      overlap. With a 100 W laser at 1064 nm wavelength, surface areas are processed
      efficiently while maintaining material integrity.
