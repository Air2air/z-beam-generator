faq:
- answer: Titanium is selected for aerospace and chemical applications due to its
    exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and outstanding corrosion resistance. Its
    ability to withstand aggressive environments ensures long-term structural integrity
    and reliability.
  question: Why is Titanium chosen for its main applications?
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage titanium if the fluence exceeds approximately
    2.5 J/cm². This can cause surface oxidation and micro-melting. To prevent this,
    always optimize your power settings and scan speed, and conduct a preliminary
    test on a small area.
  question: Can laser cleaning damage Titanium?
- answer: Verify cleaning efficacy through visual inspection for uniform matte finish
    and water break test. For aerospace applications, confirm oxygen levels remain
    below 500 ppm to prevent embrittlement, ensuring surface integrity.
  question: How can I verify Titanium was cleaned properly?
- answer: Thermal oxide layers and embedded aluminum contaminants present the greatest
    removal challenge from titanium substrates. Their strong adhesion requires precise
    fluence control near the 2.5 J/cm² threshold to avoid metallurgical damage while
    ensuring complete ablation.
  question: Which contaminants are hardest to remove from Titanium?
- answer: Titanium's high reactivity and low thermal conductivity present significant
    challenges. Its strong affinity for oxygen causes rapid re-oxidation after cleaning,
    requiring controlled atmospheres. The material's poor heat dissipation, with a
    thermal conductivity around 21 W/m·K, also elevates the risk of thermal distortion
    if laser parameters are not meticulously managed.
  question: What challenges does Titanium present in use?
- answer: Laser cleaning titanium is safe when proper protocols are followed. The
    primary hazard is the intense 1064 nm wavelength reflection, requiring certified
    laser safety eyewear and fume extraction for any generated particles. Always conduct
    a test pass at a low power setting, such as 100W, to verify parameter efficacy
    on the specific alloy.
  question: Is laser cleaning Titanium safe?
- answer: For titanium laser cleaning, a 100W fiber laser typically provides optimal
    results. This power effectively removes contaminants while preserving the base
    material's integrity. Excessive power risks surface oxidation, while insufficient
    power fails to achieve thorough cleaning, especially for aerospace-grade titanium
    requiring precise ablation thresholds.
  question: What laser power works best for Titanium?
- answer: For titanium laser cleaning, maximize scan speed while maintaining the 2.5
    J/cm² fluence threshold. Optimize throughput by utilizing the highest available
    power, such as 100W, and a 50μm spot size. This strategy ensures effective oxide
    removal in a single pass, significantly boosting productivity for aerospace components.
  question: What's the fastest approach for Titanium?
- answer: Cleaning titanium typically requires 3 passes at 500 mm/s scan speed. The
    process duration depends on oxide layer thickness and the required 50% beam overlap.
    With a 100 W laser at 1064 nm wavelength, surface areas are processed efficiently
    while maintaining material integrity.
  question: How long does cleaning Titanium typically take?
