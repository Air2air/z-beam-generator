caption:
  before: This titanium surface exhibits notable contamination through scattered particulate deposits. Contaminants manifest as irregular clusters, specifically embedding oxide particles within them. We detect localized pitting corrosion alongside micro-cracks that propagate from defect sites. Such degradation thus reveals how foreign materials erode titanium's protective oxide layer, hastening breakdown in vital applications.
  after: Notably, the cleaned titanium surface restores its inherent metallic luster. Specifically, all contaminants are eliminated while material integrity stays fully preserved.
faq:
- question: Why is Titanium chosen for its main applications?
  answer: Titanium, particularly in aerospace and chemical sectors, is chosen for its superior strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. This resilience against harsh environments thus ensures sustained structural integrity and reliability.
- question: Can laser cleaning **damage Titanium**?
  answer: '**Damage above 2.5 J/cm²**. Yes, laser cleaning can indeed damage titanium, particularly when fluence surpasses roughly 2.5 J/cm². This often results in surface oxidation and micro-melting. Thus, to avoid such problems, optimize your power settings and scan speed, while performing a preliminary test on a small area.'
- question: How can I verify **Titanium was cleaned** properly?
  answer: '**Confirm oxygen below 500 ppm**. Verify cleaning efficacy, particularly via visual inspection for a uniform matte finish and water break test. For aerospace applications, thus confirm oxygen levels below 500 ppm to prevent embrittlement and uphold surface integrity.'
- question: Which contaminants are **hardest to remove** from Titanium?
  answer: '**Requires precise fluence control**. Particularly tough to remove from titanium substrates are thermal oxide layers and embedded aluminum contaminants. Thus, their strong adhesion demands precise fluence control near the 2.5 J/cm² threshold, preventing metallurgical damage while achieving full ablation.'
- question: What challenges does Titanium present in use?
  answer: Titanium poses notable challenges from its high reactivity and low thermal conductivity. Specifically, the metal's strong oxygen affinity triggers rapid re-oxidation after cleaning, thus demanding controlled atmospheres. Its poor heat dissipation—with thermal conductivity around 21 W/m·K—further heightens thermal distortion risks if laser parameters aren't precisely tuned.
- question: Is laser cleaning **Titanium safe**?
  answer: '**Mitigates 1064 nm reflection**. When following proper protocols, laser cleaning of titanium remains safe. Notably, the chief hazard stems from intense reflection of the 1064 nm wavelength, demanding certified laser safety eyewear along with fume extraction for generated particles. Thus, perform an initial test pass at low power, say 100W, to confirm parameter effectiveness on the alloy.'
- question: What **laser power** works best for Titanium?
  answer: '**100W prevents oxidation**. For cleaning titanium via laser, a 100W fiber laser usually yields optimal results. This power removes contaminants effectively while safeguarding the base material''s integrity. Notably, excessive power can cause surface oxidation, whereas insufficient power fails to clean thoroughly, particularly for aerospace-grade titanium demanding precise ablation thresholds.'
- question: What's the fastest approach for Titanium?
  answer: For titanium laser cleaning, particularly in aerospace applications, maximize scan speed while holding the fluence threshold at 2.5 J/cm². Boost throughput by leveraging the highest power, such as 100W, paired with a 50μm spot size. Thus, effective oxide removal occurs in a single pass, markedly enhancing productivity.
- question: How long does **cleaning Titanium** typically take?
  answer: '**Depends on oxide layer thickness**. Notably, cleaning titanium involves three passes at a 500 mm/s scan speed. Process duration particularly hinges on oxide layer thickness and the required 50% beam overlap. A 100 W laser at 1064 nm wavelength thus enables efficient surface processing while preserving material integrity.'
