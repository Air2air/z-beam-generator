title: Lanthanum Laser Cleaning
subtitle: When laser cleaning lanthanum for electronics or magnet production, the
  biggest hurdle comes from its quick oxidation that dulls the surface fast, so you
  must shield it with inert gas right away to keep its soft malleability intact and
  restore that clean finish for reliable aerospace use without any lingering residue
  buildup

description: When laser cleaning Lanthanum, we've found the biggest challenge lies
  in its quick tendency to oxidize during the process, since it reacts strongly with
  air even at moderate heat levels. This sets it apart from more stable metals, demanding
  a careful approach to prevent surface discoloration that could ruin precision parts
  like optical components or magnets. To handle this, we typically use short, controlled
  pulses in an inert gas environment, which clears contaminants effectively while
  keeping the underlying material intact and shiny. Watch out for excessive dwell
  time, though—it can lead to uneven heating and potential warping on thin sections.
