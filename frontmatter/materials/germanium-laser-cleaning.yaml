title: Germanium Laser Cleaning
name: Germanium
settings_description: I've found that laser cleaning Germanium works best with gentle,
  short pulses to gently lift contaminants without stressing its brittle structure.
  This approach preserves the smooth, non-porous surface that makes it ideal for optical
  uses, as the material absorbs energy moderately and conducts heat poorly, so overheating
  stays localized. Tends to restore clarity effectively if you keep intensities low.
  Just watch out for oxidation buildup—always clean in an inert atmosphere to avoid
  surface degradation.
