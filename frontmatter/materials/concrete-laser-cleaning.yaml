micro:
  before: The surface shows dark stains and fine particles clinging tightly to the
    rough texture. Cracks and pits fill with debris that scatters light unevenly across
    the view. Layers of grime obscure the underlying grains completely.
  after: Laser treatment removes the stains and exposes smooth, bare areas on the
    texture. Particles vanish, leaving clear edges around the grains in the view.
    The surface now reflects light evenly without any hidden debris.
faq:
- question: Can laser cleaning remove paint and graffiti from concrete **without damaging
    the surface**?
  answer: '**Preserves substrate avoids aggregate exposure**. Yes, laser cleaning
    pretty effectively removes paint and graffiti from concrete. By employing a 1064
    nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it selectively ablates the coating while preserving
    the substrate. This approach typically avoids the surface etching and aggregate
    exposure seen in abrasive methods like sandblasting.'
- question: What laser settings (**wavelength, power, pulse duration**) work best
    for concrete cleaning?
  answer: '**1064 nm nanosecond pulses**. For concrete''s heterogeneous makeup, I''d
    recommend a 1064 nm wavelength at about 100 W average power. Typically, a fluence
    around 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses effectively removes contaminants while
    fairly mitigating thermal stress on the aggregate and cement matrix, preserving
    substrate integrity.'
- question: Does laser cleaning create **hazardous dust** when used on concrete, and
    how is it controlled?
  answer: '**Minimizes respirable silica dust**. Compared to abrasive blasting, laser
    cleaning produces significantly less respirable silica dust. Typically, with our
    100 W, 1064 nm settings, it basically generates coarse debris. Effective fume
    extraction remains essential to manage the fine particulate produced.'
- question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing **biological growth** like
    mold or algae from concrete?
  answer: '**Surface sterilization prevents regrowth**. Laser cleaning pretty effectively
    removes surface biological growth at ~2.5 J/cm² by thermally denaturing contaminants.
    It also sterilizes the concrete, typically preventing immediate regrowth. That
    said, its effect stays fairly limited to the surface, with no penetration for
    deeply embedded organisms.'
- question: Can laser cleaning be used on reinforced concrete without **damaging the
    rebar**?
  answer: '**Preserves concrete-rebar bond integrity**. When properly tuned, laser
    cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² pretty effectively removes contaminants from reinforced
    concrete. This approach fairly well preserves the structural cover over rebar,
    preventing exposure while upholding the vital concrete-rebar bond integrity under
    optimal parameters.'
- question: What is the typical cleaning rate (square meters per hour) for **concrete
    surfaces** with laser?
  answer: '**2-8 m²/hour multiple passes**. Typically, cleaning rates fall between
    2 and 8 m² per hour with a 100 W laser at 1064 nm. Actual speeds depend fairly
    heavily on contaminant type and surface texture, often requiring multiple passes
    at 2.5 J/cm² for full removal.'
- question: Does laser cleaning alter the **surface profile** or texture of concrete?
  answer: '**Preserves micro-roughness for adhesion**. Properly tuned laser cleaning
    at 2.5 J/cm² basically removes contaminants without altering the concrete''s micro-roughness.
    That 1064 nm wavelength pretty much avoids glazing the aggregate, preserving the
    surface profile that''s essential for optimal coating adhesion.'
- question: How does laser cleaning compare to dry ice blasting for **concrete restoration
    projects**?
  answer: '**Preserves substrate without damage**. Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² pretty
    selectively removes contaminants without harming the concrete substrate, unlike
    dry ice blasting. This delivers a superior, residue-free surface for better coating
    adhesion, though the upfront equipment cost is fairly higher.'
- question: Can laser cleaning remove efflorescence (**white salt deposits**) from
    concrete surfaces?
  answer: '**Prevents recurrence on porous substrate**. Yeah, laser cleaning pretty
    effectively removes efflorescence by vaporizing surface salts at around 2.5 J/cm².
    Basically, this beats chemical washes by clearing deposits without adding moisture,
    which is crucial for stopping their quick return on porous concrete.'
- question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily contaminated or
    oil-stained concrete?
  answer: 'Heavily oil-stained concrete creates a pretty major limitation: the depth
    of laser interaction. With our standard 2.5 J/cm² fluence, we typically clear
    surface contaminants well, but deeply penetrated oils often demand multiple passes.
    This fairly extends process time as the laser ablates contamination layer by layer.'
- question: Is laser cleaning safe for **historic concrete structures** and monuments?
  answer: '**Preserves original material integrity**. Properly calibrated at about
    2.5 J/cm², laser cleaning is fairly safe for historic concrete. This non-contact
    method offers precise control, typically removing contaminants like soot or biological
    growth with minimal substrate loss, aligning well with core conservation principles
    of preserving original material integrity.'
