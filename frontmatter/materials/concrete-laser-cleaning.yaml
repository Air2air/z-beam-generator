caption:
  before: Under the microscope, this contaminated concrete surface shows a pretty
    porous matrix clogged with fine dust particles and oily residues from urban runoff.
    Contaminants like silica aggregates and hydrocarbon films basically foster micro-fissures
    and pitting, eroding material cohesion. Such degradation cuts into longevity for
    construction jobs, such as sidewalk repairs.
  after: After thorough cleaning, the concrete masonry surface typically restores
    to a pretty smooth, even condition, upholding full material integrity for durable
    commercial flooring applications.

faq:
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning pretty effectively removes paint and graffiti from concrete.
    By employing a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it selectively ablates
    the coating while preserving the substrate. This approach typically avoids the
    surface etching and aggregate exposure seen in abrasive methods like sandblasting.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove paint and graffiti from concrete without damaging
    the surface?
  topic_keyword: without damaging the surface
  topic_statement: Preserves substrate avoids aggregate exposure
- answer: For concrete's heterogeneous makeup, I'd recommend a 1064 nm wavelength
    at about 100 W average power. Typically, a fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond
    pulses effectively removes contaminants while fairly mitigating thermal stress
    on the aggregate and cement matrix, preserving substrate integrity.
  question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best for
    concrete cleaning?
  topic_keyword: wavelength, power, pulse duration
  topic_statement: 1064 nm nanosecond pulses
- answer: Compared to abrasive blasting, laser cleaning produces significantly less
    respirable silica dust. Typically, with our 100 W, 1064 nm settings, it basically
    generates coarse debris. Effective fume extraction remains essential to manage
    the fine particulate produced.
  question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when used on concrete, and how
    is it controlled?
  topic_keyword: hazardous dust
  topic_statement: Minimizes respirable silica dust
- answer: Laser cleaning pretty effectively removes surface biological growth at ~2.5
    J/cm² by thermally denaturing contaminants. It also sterilizes the concrete, typically
    preventing immediate regrowth. That said, its effect stays fairly limited to the
    surface, with no penetration for deeply embedded organisms.
  question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing biological growth like mold
    or algae from concrete?
  topic_keyword: biological growth
  topic_statement: Surface sterilization prevents regrowth
- answer: When properly tuned, laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² pretty effectively removes
    contaminants from reinforced concrete. This approach fairly well preserves the
    structural cover over rebar, preventing exposure while upholding the vital concrete-rebar
    bond integrity under optimal parameters.
  question: Can laser cleaning be used on reinforced concrete without damaging the
    rebar?
  topic_keyword: damaging the rebar
  topic_statement: Preserves concrete-rebar bond integrity
- answer: Typically, cleaning rates fall between 2 and 8 m² per hour with a 100 W
    laser at 1064 nm. Actual speeds depend fairly heavily on contaminant type and
    surface texture, often requiring multiple passes at 2.5 J/cm² for full removal.
  question: What is the typical cleaning rate (square meters per hour) for concrete
    surfaces with laser?
  topic_keyword: concrete surfaces
  topic_statement: 2-8 m²/hour multiple passes
- answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² basically removes contaminants
    without altering the concrete's micro-roughness. That 1064 nm wavelength pretty
    much avoids glazing the aggregate, preserving the surface profile that's essential
    for optimal coating adhesion.
  question: Does laser cleaning alter the surface profile or texture of concrete?
  topic_keyword: surface profile
  topic_statement: Preserves micro-roughness for adhesion
- answer: Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² pretty selectively removes contaminants without
    harming the concrete substrate, unlike dry ice blasting. This delivers a superior,
    residue-free surface for better coating adhesion, though the upfront equipment
    cost is fairly higher.
  question: How does laser cleaning compare to dry ice blasting for concrete restoration
    projects?
  topic_keyword: concrete restoration projects
  topic_statement: Preserves substrate without damage
- answer: Yeah, laser cleaning pretty effectively removes efflorescence by vaporizing
    surface salts at around 2.5 J/cm². Basically, this beats chemical washes by clearing
    deposits without adding moisture, which is crucial for stopping their quick return
    on porous concrete.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove efflorescence (white salt deposits) from concrete
    surfaces?
  topic_keyword: white salt deposits
  topic_statement: Prevents recurrence on porous substrate
- answer: 'Heavily oil-stained concrete creates a pretty major limitation: the depth
    of laser interaction. With our standard 2.5 J/cm² fluence, we typically clear
    surface contaminants well, but deeply penetrated oils often demand multiple passes.
    This fairly extends process time as the laser ablates contamination layer by layer.'
  question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily contaminated or
    oil-stained concrete?
- answer: Properly calibrated at about 2.5 J/cm², laser cleaning is fairly safe for
    historic concrete. This non-contact method offers precise control, typically removing
    contaminants like soot or biological growth with minimal substrate loss, aligning
    well with core conservation principles of preserving original material integrity.
  question: Is laser cleaning safe for historic concrete structures and monuments?
  topic_keyword: historic concrete structures
  topic_statement: Preserves original material integrity
