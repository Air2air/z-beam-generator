caption:
  before: Microscopic inspection of the contaminated concrete surface reveals a porous matrix clogged with fine dust particles and oily residues from urban runoff. Contaminants include silica aggregates and hydrocarbon films, fostering micro-fissures and pitting that erode material cohesion. This degradation impacts longevity in construction site applications like sidewalk repairs.
  after: Following thorough cleaning, the concrete masonry surface restores to a smooth, even condition, upholding full material integrity for durable commercial flooring applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint and graffiti from concrete. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² selectively ablates the coating while preserving the substrate. This method avoids the surface etching and aggregate exposure common with abrasive techniques like sandblasting.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove paint and graffiti from concrete without damaging the surface?
  - answer: For concrete's heterogeneous composition, I recommend a 1064 nm wavelength at approximately 100 W average power. A fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses effectively removes contaminants while mitigating thermal stress on the aggregate and cement matrix, preserving the substrate integrity.
    question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best for concrete cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning generates significantly less respirable silica dust than abrasive blasting. At our typical 100 W, 1064 nm settings, the process primarily creates coarse debris. Effective fume extraction is still mandatory to control the fine particulate that is produced.
    question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when used on concrete, and how is it controlled?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes surface biological growth at ~2.5 J/cm², thermally denaturing contaminants. The process also sterilizes the concrete, preventing immediate regrowth. However, its effect is limited to the surface, offering no penetration for deeply embedded organisms.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing biological growth like mold or algae from concrete?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² effectively removes contaminants from reinforced concrete. The process preserves the structural cover over rebar, preventing exposure and maintaining the critical concrete-rebar bond integrity when using optimal parameters.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used on reinforced concrete without damaging the rebar?
  - answer: Typical cleaning rates range from 2 to 8 m²/hour using a 100 W laser at 1064 nm. The actual speed is highly dependent on the contaminant type and surface texture, with multiple passes at 2.5 J/cm² often required for complete removal.
    question: What is the typical cleaning rate (square meters per hour) for concrete surfaces with laser?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² removes contaminants without altering the concrete's micro-roughness. The 1064 nm wavelength avoids glazing aggregate, preserving the surface profile essential for optimal coating adhesion.
    question: Does laser cleaning alter the surface profile or texture of concrete?
  - answer: Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² selectively removes contaminants without damaging the concrete substrate, unlike dry ice. This provides a superior, residue-free surface for coating adhesion, though the initial equipment investment is higher.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to dry ice blasting for concrete restoration projects?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes efflorescence by vaporizing surface salts at approximately 2.5 J/cm². This method outperforms chemical washes by eliminating deposits without introducing moisture, which is key to preventing their rapid recurrence on the porous concrete substrate.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove efflorescence (white salt deposits) from concrete surfaces?
  - answer: 'Heavily oil-stained concrete presents a key limitation: the depth of laser interaction. At our standard 2.5 J/cm² fluence, we effectively remove surface contaminants, but deeply penetrated oils often require multiple passes. This increases process time as the laser gradually ablates the contamination layer-by-layer.'
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily contaminated or oil-stained concrete?
  - answer: When properly calibrated at ~2.5 J/cm², laser cleaning is exceptionally safe for historic concrete. This non-contact method provides precise control, removing contaminants like soot or biological growth with minimal substrate loss, fully aligning with core conservation principles of preserving original material integrity.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for historic concrete structures and monuments?
