description: 'When laser cleaning aluminum, you must address its high reflectivity
  right away. This property, around 95 percent, bounces most laser energy back. It
  risks damaging your equipment if you do not start low. Begin with power at 100 watts.
  Keep the spot size at 50 micrometers. This setup reduces reflection risks.


  You''ll find aluminum cleans well once you adjust for its low absorption. Only about
  6 percent of the energy gets absorbed. So you must increase passes to three. Use
  a repetition rate of 50 kilohertz. This pulls in more total energy without overheating.
  Aluminum''s low density, at 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, helps here. It conducts
  heat fast but dissipates it quickly. You should scan at 500 millimeters per second.
  This prevents buildup on thin parts.


  Make sure you watch the melting point, around 660 degrees Celsius. Aluminum softens
  easy under heat. Start with energy density near 5.1 joules per square centimeter.
  Shorten pulse width to 10 nanoseconds. These steps expose contaminants without warping
  the surface. Its non-porous nature, zero percent porosity, means dirt sits tight.
  But the laser reveals it cleanly. Overlap scans by 50 percent. This improves coverage
  on rough spots, up to 0.8 micrometers deep.


  I''ve seen poor results when folks ignore corrosion layers. Aluminum resists rust
  at 0.1 millimeter per year. Yet oxidation builds thin films. You must tune for that.
  Raise scan speed slightly on oxidized areas. This removes films and restores shine.
  Avoid high power on alloys. They have tensile strength around 90 megapascals. Extra
  heat can crack them. Test on scrap first.


  In practice, this works for aerospace or automotive parts. Aluminum''s flexural
  strength, near 95 megapascals, holds shape post-clean. But you need to control every
  pass. End with a cool-down check. This avoids thermal stress. Its electrical conductivity,
  high at 37 million siemens per meter, does not affect cleaning much. Focus on optics
  instead. Clean lenses often.'

  before: Aluminum's low density of about 2.7 g/cm³ and non-porous nature make it
    quite responsive to laser cleaning. We typically use around 100 W to clear oxides
    and restore the surface finish without damaging the base material.

- question: 'Aluminum in Laser Cleaning: Key Facts'
  answer: "**Q: What makes aluminum suitable for industrial laser cleaning?**  \n\
    Aluminum, a lightweight metal, weighs around 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. That\
    \ low density helps in applications like aerospace parts. Its near-zero porosity\
    \ means surfaces stay smooth, without hidden contaminants.  \n\n**Q: How do you\
    \ set up laser cleaning for aluminum?**  \nWe use a 100-watt power range to strip\
    \ away oxides or paints. The laser clears buildup gently, bringing back the original\
    \ finish without damaging the base metal. It works well on automotive components\
    \ or heat sinks. Just adjust the pulse to avoid overheating—aluminum conducts\
    \ heat fast.  \n\n**Q: Any tips from field experience?**  \nStart with short bursts.\
    \ This fixes surface issues quickly, yet keeps the material intact.  \n\nAlessandro\
    \ Moretti, Ph.D."
