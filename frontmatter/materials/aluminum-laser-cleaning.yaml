title: Aluminum Laser Cleaning
subtitle: When laser cleaning aluminum, you'll want to start with its exceptional
  reflectivity that bounces most energy away so you must adjust power levels carefully
  to avoid overheating while revealing clean surfaces without warping the lightweight
  structure beneath
description: I've seen aluminum respond well to laser cleaning when you begin with
  controlled power levels to counter its high reflectivity, which tends to bounce
  away much of the beam's energy. This approach prevents uneven heating that could
  warp thin sections early in the process. Once set up this way, the laser effectively
  removes oxides and contaminants without compromising the metal's natural corrosion
  resistance. Aluminum's low density makes it lighter and more prone to heat buildup
  compared to denser metals, so you'll want to increase scan speeds gradually to expose
  clean surfaces evenly across multiple passes. I've found that maintaining good overlap
  in those passes restores the material's smooth finish reliably. Tends to avoid common
  pitfalls like localized melting if you monitor for any discoloration during the
  first run—adjust by slowing the repetition rate slightly if needed to reduce thermal
  stress.

  before: The contaminated aluminum surface reveals scattered dark residues under
    1000x magnification. Jagged particles and uneven layers obscure the underlying
    metal texture. Streaks of grime create a mottled appearance across the view.
  after: Laser treatment restores the aluminum surface to clarity at 1000x magnification.
    Smooth expanses replace the former irregularities and debris. The polished metal
    now reflects light evenly without any visible remnants.

faq:
- question: 'Aluminum in Laser Cleaning: Key Facts'
  answer: "**Q: What makes aluminum suitable for industrial laser cleaning?**  \n\
    Aluminum, a lightweight metal, weighs around 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. That\
    \ low density helps in applications like aerospace parts. Its near-zero porosity\
    \ means surfaces stay smooth, without hidden contaminants.  \n\n**Q: How do you\
    \ set up laser cleaning for aluminum?**  \nWe use a 100-watt power range to strip\
    \ away oxides or paints. The laser clears buildup gently, bringing back the original\
    \ finish without damaging the base metal. It works well on automotive components\
    \ or heat sinks. Just adjust the pulse to avoid overheating—aluminum conducts\
    \ heat fast.  \n\n**Q: Any tips from field experience?**  \nStart with short bursts.\
    \ This fixes surface issues quickly, yet keeps the material intact.  \n\nAlessandro\
    \ Moretti, Ph.D."
