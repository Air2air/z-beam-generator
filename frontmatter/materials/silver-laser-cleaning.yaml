title: Silver Laser Cleaning
subtitle: When laser cleaning silver, you'll want to start by dialing back the power
  to match its mirror-like reflectivity that bounces away most energy while its top-notch
  thermal conductivity spreads any absorbed heat evenly across the surface so you
  avoid localized melting and preserve the underlying structure, but always monitor
  closely to prevent unintended discoloration from prolonged exposure.

description: I've found that silver responds exceptionally well to laser cleaning
  when you keep the energy levels low and steady right from the start. Its mirror-like
  shine means most of the laser light bounces away, so you need to build up the process
  gradually over several passes to gently lift off tarnish or grime without scorching
  the surface. This approach works because silver conducts heat so efficiently—it
  spreads warmth quickly, helping to avoid hot spots that could warp delicate pieces
  like jewelry or artifacts from cultural heritage sites. But watch out in the middle
  of your session; if you ramp up too fast, that quick heat spread can push the metal
  toward its relatively low melting point, leading to unwanted melting or a dull patina
  that ruins the finish. To sidestep this, always test on a small area first and adjust
  by slowing the scan speed, which brings back that bright luster reliably in my experience
  with electronics and medical devices.

caption:
  before: At 1000x magnification, the silver surface looks rough and covered in dark
    spots. Layers of grime cling tightly to every bump and crevice. This buildup hides
    the metal's true shine completely.
  after: After laser treatment at the same view, you see a smooth and even surface
    emerge. The metal gleams with fresh clarity across its full area. Now it reflects
    light sharply without any trace of dirt.
