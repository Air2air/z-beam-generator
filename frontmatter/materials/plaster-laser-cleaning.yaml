  before: I've examined the plaster surface before cleaning, and it looks rough with
    dark specks scattered everywhere. Grime clings tightly to the tiny cracks and
    pores, making the whole thing appear dull and uneven. Dust particles stick out,
    blocking any clear view of the base material.
  after: After the laser treatment, that same surface turns smooth and bright under
    magnification. The specks and grime vanish completely, revealing clean pores without
    any residue. Now it shines evenly, showing the plaster's natural texture without
faq:
- question: Can a laser cleaner remove paint from a plaster wall without **damaging
    the underlying surface**?
  answer: '**Nanosecond pulses prevent thermal weakening**. Yes, laser cleaning effectively
    removes paint from plaster walls while preserving the underlying substrate. Specifically,
    a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5 J/cm² fluence ablates the coating with minimal heat
    transfer. Thus, employing nanosecond pulses avoids subsurface thermal damage that
    could weaken the porous plaster structure.'
- question: What is the safe laser power and fluence level for cleaning soot or smoke
    residue from **historic plaster**?
  answer: '**Low fluence avoids vitrification**. For historic plaster, particularly
    with its delicate nature, start testing at 2.5 J/cm² fluence using a 100W laser.
    Excessive power can thus lead to permanent discoloration or vitrification, which
    alters the surface. Always test parameters first on a hidden area to confirm soot
    removal without harming the substrate.'
- question: Does laser cleaning create **hazardous dust** when used on plaster, and
    how does it compare to traditional methods?
  answer: '**Requires HEPA extraction and PPE**. Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² notably
    produces far less bulk dust than mechanical methods. Yet, it generates fine particulates,
    thus requiring HEPA-filtered extraction and respiratory PPE, particularly for
    historic plasters with unknown contaminants.'
- question: Why does my laser sometimes leave a **darkened or yellowed stain** on
    the plaster surface after cleaning?
  answer: '**Avoids mineral hydrate alteration**. Low power may carbonize embedded
    organics, whereas, notably, fluence exceeding 2.5 J/cm² disrupts plaster''s mineral
    hydrates. Thus, fine-tune your 1064 nm laser parameters to sidestep these thermal
    issues, achieving contaminant removal without substrate damage that causes yellowing.'
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing **biological growth** like mold
    or algae from exterior plaster (stucco)?
  answer: '**Porous substrate retains spores**. Yes, notably, laser cleaning removes
    biological growth from plaster at 2.5 J/cm² fluence without introducing moisture.
    However, the porous substrate often retains spores, thus requiring a follow-up
    chemical treatment for full remediation and to curb rapid regrowth.'
- question: What wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 10600nm) is most effective for laser cleaning
    plaster, and why?
  answer: For plaster cleaning, notably the 10600nm CO₂ laser wavelength proves most
    effective. This infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrates in gypsum,
    thus enabling efficient contaminant removal at 2.5 J/cm² while minimizing thermal
    damage to the delicate substrate.
- question: How do I clean **different types of plaster** (e.g., gypsum, lime, cement-based)
    with a laser? Do the settings change?
  answer: '**Adjust fluence by plaster softness**. Due to its softness, lime plaster
    particularly needs a gentle ~2.5 J/cm² fluence, whereas harder cement-based materials
    handle slightly higher energy. First, identify your substrate always; incorrect
    1064 nm settings can thus cause thermal degradation.'
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to delicately clean fragile, historic plaster
    moldings and ornaments?
  answer: Laser cleaning proves particularly effective for conserving delicate plaster,
    with a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² and 100 µm spot size. Notably, this non-contact approach
    using nanosecond pulses selectively removes contaminants, thus safeguarding fragile
    historic details without abrasion.
- question: What are the main advantages of using laser cleaning over chemical or
    abrasive methods for **plaster restoration**?
  answer: '**Preserves fragile substrate**. Laser cleaning delivers excellent selectivity,
    particularly for plaster, by removing contaminants at 2.5 J/cm² without harming
    the delicate substrate. This contactless approach eliminates chemical residues
    and sidesteps mechanical stress from abrasives, thus safeguarding original surfaces.
    Notably, our 1064 nm wavelength achieves thorough cleaning with minimal thermal
    effects.'
- question: How does the **high porosity** of plaster affect the laser cleaning process
    and the final result?
  answer: '**Requires multi-pass for deep removal**. Plaster''s high porosity particularly
    enables contaminants to penetrate deeply, necessitating multiple passes at 2.5
    J/cm² for full removal. Its structure traps ablation byproducts, thus complicating
    the procedure. Notably, a ''clean'' surface means extracting these embedded particles
    successfully without substrate damage.'
