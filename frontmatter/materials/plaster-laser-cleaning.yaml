caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the plaster surface displays fine cracks and pitting
    from degradation, with dark dust particles and oily residues embedded in porous
    areas. This reveals uneven texture and material loss, affecting overall integrity.
  after: The laser-cleaned plaster surface shows a smooth, even finish free of residues.
    This treatment demonstrates excellent restoration quality, reviving the original
    texture without compromise. Material integrity remains fully intact, and it ensures
    the masonry's enduring strength for general applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can remove paint from plaster walls while preserving
      the substrate. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively
      ablates the coating with minimal heat transfer. The key is employing nanosecond
      pulses to avoid the subsurface thermal damage that would weaken the porous plaster
      structure.
    question: Can a laser cleaner remove paint from a plaster wall without damaging
      the underlying surface?
  - answer: For historic plaster, begin testing at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a 100W laser.
      Excessive power can cause permanent discoloration or vitrification, altering
      the surface. Always validate parameters on a concealed area first to ensure
      the soot is removed without damaging the delicate substrate.
    question: What is the safe laser power and fluence level for cleaning soot or
      smoke residue from historic plaster?
  - answer: Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² generates significantly less bulk dust than
      mechanical methods. However, it produces fine particulate, necessitating HEPA-filtered
      extraction and respiratory PPE, especially for historic plasters containing
      unknown contaminants.
    question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when used on plaster, and
      how does it compare to traditional methods?
  - answer: Low power can carbonize embedded organics, while excessive fluence above
      2.5 J/cm² alters plaster's mineral hydrates. Optimize your 1064 nm laser's parameters
      to avoid these thermal effects, ensuring contaminant removal without inducing
      yellowing from substrate damage.
    question: Why does my laser sometimes leave a darkened or yellowed stain on the
      plaster surface after cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes biological growth from plaster
      using 2.5 J/cm² fluence without adding moisture. However, the porous substrate
      often retains spores, so a subsequent chemical treatment is essential for complete
      remediation and to prevent rapid regrowth.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing biological growth like mold
      or algae from exterior plaster (stucco)?
  - answer: For plaster cleaning, the 10600nm CO₂ laser wavelength is most effective.
      This infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrates in gypsum, enabling
      efficient contaminant removal at 2.5 J/cm² while minimizing thermal damage to
      the delicate substrate.
    question: What wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 10600nm) is most effective for laser
      cleaning plaster, and why?
  - answer: Lime plaster requires gentle ~2.5 J/cm² fluence due to its softness, while
      harder cement-based types tolerate slightly higher energy. Always identify your
      material first, as incorrect 1064 nm settings can thermally degrade sensitive
      substrates.
    question: How do I clean different types of plaster (e.g., gypsum, lime, cement-based)
      with a laser? Do the settings change?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for delicate plaster conservation using 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence and 100 µm spot size. This non-contact method with nanosecond pulses
      selectively removes contaminants while preserving fragile historic details without
      abrasion.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to delicately clean fragile, historic plaster
      moldings and ornaments?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior selectivity for plaster, removing contaminants
      at 2.5 J/cm² without eroding the fragile substrate. This non-contact process
      eliminates chemical residues and avoids the mechanical stress caused by abrasives,
      preserving original surfaces. Our 1064 nm wavelength ensures effective cleaning
      with minimal thermal impact.
    question: What are the main advantages of using laser cleaning over chemical or
      abrasive methods for plaster restoration?
  - answer: Plaster's high porosity allows contaminants to penetrate deeply, requiring
      multiple passes at 2.5 J/cm² for complete removal. The structure can trap ablation
      byproducts, complicating the process. Consequently, a 'clean' surface is defined
      by the successful extraction of these deeply embedded particles without causing
      substrate damage.
    question: How does the high porosity of plaster affect the laser cleaning process
      and the final result?
