title: Plaster Laser Cleaning
faq:
- question: Can a laser cleaner remove paint from a plaster wall without damaging the underlying surface?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning can remove paint from plaster walls while preserving the substrate. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively ablates the coating with minimal heat transfer. The key is employing nanosecond pulses to avoid the subsurface thermal damage that would weaken the porous plaster structure.
- question: What is the safe laser power and fluence level for cleaning soot or smoke residue from historic plaster?
  answer: For historic plaster, begin testing at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a 100W laser. Excessive power can cause permanent discoloration or vitrification, altering the surface. Always validate parameters on a concealed area first to ensure the soot is removed without damaging the delicate substrate.
- question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when used on plaster, and how does it compare to traditional methods?
  answer: Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² generates significantly less bulk dust than mechanical methods. However, it produces fine particulate, necessitating HEPA-filtered extraction and respiratory PPE, especially for historic plasters containing unknown contaminants.
- question: Why does my laser sometimes leave a darkened or yellowed stain on the plaster surface after cleaning?
  answer: Low power can carbonize embedded organics, while excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm² alters plaster's mineral hydrates. Optimize your 1064 nm laser's parameters to avoid these thermal effects, ensuring contaminant removal without inducing yellowing from substrate damage.
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing biological growth like mold or algae from exterior plaster (stucco)?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes biological growth from plaster using 2.5 J/cm² fluence without adding moisture. However, the porous substrate often retains spores, so a subsequent chemical treatment is essential for complete remediation and to prevent rapid regrowth.
- question: What wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 10600nm) is most effective for laser cleaning plaster, and why?
  answer: For plaster cleaning, the 10600nm CO₂ laser wavelength is most effective. This infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrates in gypsum, enabling efficient contaminant removal at 2.5 J/cm² while minimizing thermal damage to the delicate substrate.
- question: How do I clean different types of plaster (e.g., gypsum, lime, cement-based) with a laser? Do the settings change?
  answer: Lime plaster requires gentle ~2.5 J/cm² fluence due to its softness, while harder cement-based types tolerate slightly higher energy. Always identify your material first, as incorrect 1064 nm settings can thermally degrade sensitive substrates.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to delicately clean fragile, historic plaster moldings and ornaments?
  answer: Laser cleaning excels for delicate plaster conservation using 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size. This non-contact method with nanosecond pulses selectively removes contaminants while preserving fragile historic details without abrasion.
- question: What are the main advantages of using laser cleaning over chemical or abrasive methods for plaster restoration?
  answer: Laser cleaning offers superior selectivity for plaster, removing contaminants at 2.5 J/cm² without eroding the fragile substrate. This non-contact process eliminates chemical residues and avoids the mechanical stress caused by abrasives, preserving original surfaces. Our 1064 nm wavelength ensures effective cleaning with minimal thermal impact.
- question: How does the high porosity of plaster affect the laser cleaning process and the final result?
  answer: Plaster's high porosity allows contaminants to penetrate deeply, requiring multiple passes at 2.5 J/cm² for complete removal. The structure can trap ablation byproducts, complicating the process. Consequently, a 'clean' surface is defined by the successful extraction of these deeply embedded particles without causing substrate damage.
