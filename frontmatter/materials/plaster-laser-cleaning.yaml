  before: Examining the plaster under the microscope reveals fine cracks and pitting
    from degradation, particularly with dark dust particles and oily residues lodged
    in porous zones. This thus indicates uneven texture alongside material loss, compromising
    overall integrity.
  after: Notably, the laser-cleaned plaster surface exhibits a smooth, even finish
    devoid of residues. This approach particularly highlights superior restoration
    quality, revitalizing the original texture without any drawbacks. Material integrity
    stays fully preserved, thus securing the masonry's long-term durability for typical
    uses.

faq:
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint from plaster walls while preserving
    the underlying substrate. Specifically, a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5 J/cm² fluence
    ablates the coating with minimal heat transfer. Thus, employing nanosecond pulses
    avoids subsurface thermal damage that could weaken the porous plaster structure.
  question: Can a laser cleaner remove paint from a plaster wall without damaging
    the underlying surface?
  topic_keyword: damaging the underlying surface
  topic_statement: Nanosecond pulses prevent thermal weakening
- answer: For historic plaster, particularly with its delicate nature, start testing
    at 2.5 J/cm² fluence using a 100W laser. Excessive power can thus lead to permanent
    discoloration or vitrification, which alters the surface. Always test parameters
    first on a hidden area to confirm soot removal without harming the substrate.
  question: What is the safe laser power and fluence level for cleaning soot or smoke
    residue from historic plaster?
  topic_keyword: historic plaster
  topic_statement: Low fluence avoids vitrification
- answer: Laser ablation at 2.5 J/cm² notably produces far less bulk dust than mechanical
    methods. Yet, it generates fine particulates, thus requiring HEPA-filtered extraction
    and respiratory PPE, particularly for historic plasters with unknown contaminants.
  question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when used on plaster, and how
    does it compare to traditional methods?
  topic_keyword: hazardous dust
  topic_statement: Requires HEPA extraction and PPE
- answer: Low power may carbonize embedded organics, whereas, notably, fluence exceeding
    2.5 J/cm² disrupts plaster's mineral hydrates. Thus, fine-tune your 1064 nm laser
    parameters to sidestep these thermal issues, achieving contaminant removal without
    substrate damage that causes yellowing.
  question: Why does my laser sometimes leave a darkened or yellowed stain on the
    plaster surface after cleaning?
  topic_keyword: darkened or yellowed stain
  topic_statement: Avoids mineral hydrate alteration
- answer: Yes, notably, laser cleaning removes biological growth from plaster at 2.5
    J/cm² fluence without introducing moisture. However, the porous substrate often
    retains spores, thus requiring a follow-up chemical treatment for full remediation
    and to curb rapid regrowth.
  question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing biological growth like mold or
    algae from exterior plaster (stucco)?
  topic_keyword: biological growth
  topic_statement: Porous substrate retains spores
- answer: For plaster cleaning, notably the 10600nm CO₂ laser wavelength proves most
    effective. This infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrates in gypsum,
    thus enabling efficient contaminant removal at 2.5 J/cm² while minimizing thermal
    damage to the delicate substrate.
  question: What wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 10600nm) is most effective for laser cleaning
    plaster, and why?
- answer: Due to its softness, lime plaster particularly needs a gentle ~2.5 J/cm²
    fluence, whereas harder cement-based materials handle slightly higher energy.
    First, identify your substrate always; incorrect 1064 nm settings can thus cause
    thermal degradation.
  question: How do I clean different types of plaster (e.g., gypsum, lime, cement-based)
    with a laser? Do the settings change?
  topic_keyword: different types of plaster
  topic_statement: Adjust fluence by plaster softness
- answer: Laser cleaning proves particularly effective for conserving delicate plaster,
    with a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² and 100 µm spot size. Notably, this non-contact approach
    using nanosecond pulses selectively removes contaminants, thus safeguarding fragile
    historic details without abrasion.
  question: Can laser cleaning be used to delicately clean fragile, historic plaster
    moldings and ornaments?
- answer: Laser cleaning delivers excellent selectivity, particularly for plaster,
    by removing contaminants at 2.5 J/cm² without harming the delicate substrate.
    This contactless approach eliminates chemical residues and sidesteps mechanical
    stress from abrasives, thus safeguarding original surfaces. Notably, our 1064
    nm wavelength achieves thorough cleaning with minimal thermal effects.
  question: What are the main advantages of using laser cleaning over chemical or
    abrasive methods for plaster restoration?
  topic_keyword: plaster restoration
  topic_statement: Preserves fragile substrate
- answer: Plaster's high porosity particularly enables contaminants to penetrate deeply,
    necessitating multiple passes at 2.5 J/cm² for full removal. Its structure traps
    ablation byproducts, thus complicating the procedure. Notably, a 'clean' surface
    means extracting these embedded particles successfully without substrate damage.
  question: How does the high porosity of plaster affect the laser cleaning process
    and the final result?
  topic_keyword: high porosity
  topic_statement: Requires multi-pass for deep removal
