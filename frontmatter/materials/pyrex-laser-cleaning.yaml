caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the Pyrex surface displays a contaminated condition
    marked by clustered particulates and oily residues. These contaminants, fine dust
    and hydrocarbon films, adhere unevenly, forming hazy domains that obscure the
    glass's clarity. Surface degradation manifests in micro-pitting and faint cracks,
    eroding the material's smooth integrity and signaling potential long-term weakening.
  after: After meticulous cleaning, the Pyrex surface emerges pristine, with its inherent
    transparency fully restored. This clarity, it reveals no residual contaminants
    or micro-abrasions, ensuring optical purity akin to the original state. The restoration
    quality excels, preserving the glass's thermal resistance and structural integrity
    without compromising its borosilicate composition. For general applications, such
    as laboratory use, this condition guarantees reliable performance and longevity.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For Pyrex cleaning, employ a 1064 nm wavelength with ~25 W average power
      and 100 ns pulses. Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to selectively remove organics
      and particulates without micro-cracking the substrate, as this wavelength is
      poorly absorbed by the pristine glass. A 50 μm spot size scanned at 500 mm/s
      ensures effective, non-damaging results.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning contaminants from Pyrex without damaging the surface?
  - answer: Yes, Pyrex's low thermal expansion makes it vulnerable to microfractures
      from excessive fluence. We prevent this using nanosecond pulses at 2.5 J/cm²
      and a 50 μm spot size. A defocused beam or thin water film further manages thermal
      stress, ensuring the integrity of your precision components.
    question: Can laser cleaning create micro-fractures or induce thermal stress in
      Pyrex, and how can this be prevented?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence safely removes labels from Pyrex. This process vaporizes adhesives without
      chemical residue, preserving the material's optical clarity and structural integrity
      for laboratory applications.
    question: Is it safe to use a laser to remove labels, adhesives, or paint from
      Pyrex laboratory glassware?
  - answer: Properly calibrated laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence maintains Pyrex's
      optical clarity. This process avoids surface hazing and minimizes roughness
      changes, ensuring high transmission with negligible light scattering for demanding
      optical applications.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the optical properties and surface roughness
      of Pyrex?
  - answer: Thermal shock from exceeding 2.5 J/cm² can shatter Pyrex. The 1064 nm
      wavelength requires IR-specific laser safety eyewear. Hazardous glass and coating
      particulates necessitate a properly fitted respirator to protect against inhalation.
    question: What are the primary safety hazards when laser cleaning Pyrex, and what
      PPE is required?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively prepares Pyrex for high-vacuum applications.
      Using a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5 J/cm² removes contaminants and activates
      the surface without subsurface damage, outperforming solvent methods for superior
      thin-film adhesion.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a Pyrex surface for high-vacuum
      or thin-film deposition applications?
  - answer: Pulsed fiber lasers, typically at 1064 nm wavelength, provide nanosecond
      pulses that enable precise thermal control. This prevents heat diffusion into
      the Pyrex bulk, crucial as its low thermal conductivity makes it susceptible
      to thermal shock from continuous-wave exposure.
    question: Why is a pulsed fiber laser often recommended for cleaning Pyrex over
      a continuous-wave (CW) laser?
  - answer: First, inspect under 50× magnification for micro-cracks. For critical
      flatness in optics, use white-light interferometry to verify surface roughness
      remains below 10 nm Ra. Finally, conduct a helium leak test to ensure integrity
      for vacuum systems, confirming the 2.5 J/cm² fluence didn't compromise the material.
    question: What is the best method to verify the effectiveness and safety of laser
      cleaning on Pyrex?
  - answer: For deeply embedded metallic stains in Pyrex, we use a multi-step approach.
      First, a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence selectively vaporizes the surface
      contaminant. A subsequent, gentler pass then removes any remaining diffusion
      layer without exceeding the ablation threshold of the Pyrex substrate itself.
    question: How do you clean deeply embedded metallic stains or diffusion layers
      from Pyrex with a laser?
