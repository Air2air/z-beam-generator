caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the porcelain surface looks very rough and heavily
    contaminated. Fine particles scatter and cluster, building irregular layers that
    hide the original smooth glaze. Contaminants appear as dark, amorphous deposits—mostly
    organic residues and mineral dusts—that cling tightly, resulting in discoloration.
    From a practical view, surface degradation shows in micro-cracks and pitting,
    where etching weakens the ceramic structure, boosting porosity and drawing in
    more soiling.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the porcelain surface turns very smooth and
    glossy, restoring its original clean condition effectively. This process removes
    contaminants while preserving the ceramic's fine texture; material integrity remains
    intact, free from cracks or alterations. Restoration quality is excellent for
    general applications.

faq:
- answer: For historical porcelain, a straightforward choice is the 1064 nm wavelength
    with fluence under 2.5 J/cm² and nanosecond pulses. That method efficiently removes
    contaminants like soot while safeguarding the delicate glaze. Test these parameters
    on a concealed spot first to prevent micro-cracking or gloss changes.
  question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) are safe and effective
    for cleaning soot, grime, or biological growth from historical porcelain without
    damaging the glaze?
- answer: Using a 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size, the 1064 nm laser straightforwardly
    ablates metal staining from porcelain. This process exploits the glaze's strong
    thermal shock resistance to efficiently vaporize contaminants, sidestepping the
    substrate etching risks from chemical poultices' extended contact.
  question: Can a laser safely remove metal staining (like rust or bronze drips) from
    a porcelain surface without etching or discoloring it?
  topic_keyword: etching or discoloring
  topic_statement: Glaze's high thermal shock resistance
- answer: Glazed porcelain's high reflectivity at 1064 nm poses serious stray radiation
    risks. For practical safety, operators should wear wavelength-specific laser safety
    glasses, as this process requires a 2.5 J/cm² fluence that's mostly reflected,
    not absorbed, by the substrate.
  question: How does the high reflectivity of a glazed porcelain surface affect the
    laser cleaning process and operator safety?
  topic_keyword: high reflectivity
  topic_statement: Requires wavelength-specific safety glasses
- answer: This process of laser cleaning on crazed porcelain risks thermal stress
    propagation at fluences above 2.5 J/cm², potentially fusing contaminants within
    micro-fractures. For such delicate pieces, practical non-thermal alternatives
    help avoid worsening existing hairline cracks.
  question: Is laser cleaning suitable for porcelain with existing hairline cracks
    (crazing), or does it risk worsening the damage?
  topic_keyword: hairline cracks (crazing)
  topic_statement: Risks thermal stress propagation
- answer: Over-cleaning can straightforwardly cause glaze ablation if fluence tops
    ~2.5 J/cm². Watch for high-pitched acoustic shifts and permanent surface matting,
    clear signs of damage. This process at 1064 nm wavelength efficiently balances
    contaminant removal with substrate protection.
  question: What is the risk of 'over-cleaning' or ablating the actual porcelain glaze
    when trying to remove a tenacious contaminant?
  topic_keyword: porcelain glaze
  topic_statement: Glaze ablation above 2.5 J/cm²
- answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² using nanosecond pulses efficiently yields a
    stable, non-invasive surface on porcelain. For weathered archaeological pieces,
    this process of applying a silica-based consolidant ensures the long-term stability
    of the cleaned glaze.
  question: After laser cleaning porcelain, is any post-treatment or protective coating
    required to stabilize the surface?
  topic_keyword: stabilize the surface
  topic_statement: Silica consolidant for glaze stability
- answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² straightforwardly removes conductive salt layers
    from porcelain, efficiently restoring dielectric integrity. This process gets
    verified via leakage current measurements and hydrophobicity tests, serving as
    a practical, non-abrasive option over traditional sandblasting that safeguards
    the substrate.
  question: For industrial porcelain (e.g., electrical insulators), can laser cleaning
    restore dielectric strength by removing all conductive pollution, and how is effectiveness
    verified?
  topic_keyword: dielectric strength
  topic_statement: Restores dielectric integrity
- answer: Hard-paste porcelain delivers superior thermal stability, enabling higher
    fluence up to 2.5 J/cm² in a straightforward way. Conversely, soft-paste's lower
    vitrification point and greater thermal expansion call for a practical strategy
    involving reduced power and precise thermal management to avoid glaze damage and
    micro-fracturing. Identifying the material thus becomes an essential initial step.
  question: How do the different compositions of hard-paste vs. soft-paste porcelain
    affect the laser cleaning strategy and risk assessment?
  topic_keyword: hard-paste vs. soft-paste
  topic_statement: Adjusts fluence for thermal stability
- answer: Laser cleaning stands out for porcelain with its non-contact precision,
    crucial for detailed relief designs. Applying a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² and a 100
    µm spot, this process efficiently removes contaminants without mechanical damage
    or chemical traces. Straightforward results keep the fragile ceramic base fully
    intact, safeguarding its structure and visual appeal.
  question: What are the key advantages of using a laser over chemical or mechanical
    (abrasive) methods for cleaning delicate porcelain artifacts?
