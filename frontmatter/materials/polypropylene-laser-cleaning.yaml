caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the polypropylene surface appears dirty-dirty and uneven,
    covered by oily contaminants that stick-stick tightly and gritty particles that
    scatter-scatter across it. These make the texture rough-rough, so degradation
    shows as small-small pits and micro-cracks, weakening the plastic then reducing
    its smoothness for cleaning applications.
  after: The polypropylene surface is cleaned very-very thoroughly by the laser process,
    restoring smoothness and shine. Material integrity remains intact, appearing pristine
    and undamaged.

  questions:
  - answer: Ya, polypropylene dapat dibersihkan dengan laser secara aman menggunakan
      parameter terkontrol. Dengan fluence 1.2 J/cm² dan spot size 100 µm pada 1064
      nm, kontaminan terangkat tanpa melelehkan substrat yang titik leburnya 160-170°C.
      Kecepatan scan 500 mm/s dan overlap 50% mencegah akumulasi panas berlebih.
    question: Can you safely laser clean polypropylene without melting or damaging
      the surface?
  - answer: Polypropylene's transparency at 1μm wavelengths necessitates indirect
      cleaning via contaminant absorption. We recommend 1064 nm lasers with 1.2 J/cm²
      fluence and 100 μs dwell time to selectively remove surface layers without substrate
      degradation. This approach leverages the material's own optical properties for
      safe, effective cleaning.
    question: What laser wavelength is most effective for cleaning contaminants from
      polypropylene?
  - answer: For silicone-based release agents on polypropylene, we utilize a 1064
      nm wavelength with a fluence of 1.2 J/cm². This effectively ablates the thin
      organic film while the 100 µm spot size ensures the substrate remains undamaged.
      Verification is then performed via FTIR spectroscopy.
    question: How do you remove mold release agents from polypropylene surfaces with
      laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning significantly enhances polypropylene's adhesion through
      surface activation. At optimal 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 1064 nm wavelength, we
      achieve improved wettability that often surpasses traditional flame treatment
      for subsequent bonding applications.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the adhesion properties of polypropylene
      for subsequent painting or bonding?
  - answer: Polypropylene decomposition at 1.2 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous aldehydes
      like formaldehyde. You must employ local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/activated
      carbon filtration. Operators require appropriate respiratory protection to mitigate
      inhalation risks from these ultrafine particulates and gases.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning polypropylene
      due to fume generation?
  - answer: Ya, laser cleaning dengan fluence 1.2 J/cm² pada 1064 nm secara bersamaan
      meningkatkan energi permukaan polipropilena. Perlakuan ini menciptakan mikro-roughness
      yang meningkatkan adhesi cetak, setara dengan korona namun lebih terkontrol
      dan bebas kimia.
    question: Can laser cleaning create surface modifications that improve polypropylene's
      printability?
  - answer: Polypropylene's yellowing stems from thermal degradation when fluence
      exceeds ~1.2 J/cm², causing polymer chain scission. Optimize parameters like
      a 500 mm/s scan speed to minimize localized heating and prevent oxidation that
      leads to chromophore formation.
    question: Why does polypropylene sometimes turn yellow or brown after laser cleaning?
  - answer: Untuk membersihkan oksidasi dari polipropilena tua, gunakan fluens rendah
      1.2 J/cm² dengan panjang gelombang 1064 nm. Parameter ini mengatasi embrittlement
      dengan meminimalkan penetrasi termal, secara efektif menghilangkan lapisan terdegradasi
      UV tanpa merusak substrat.
    question: What laser parameters work best for removing oxidation layers from aged
      polypropylene?
  - answer: Filler materials like talc significantly alter absorption dynamics, requiring
      parameter adjustments to prevent selective removal. For filled PP composites,
      reduce fluence to approximately 1.0 J/cm² from the standard 1.2 J/cm² to avoid
      exposing underlying particles while still achieving effective surface cleaning.
      This prevents undesirable surface morphology changes.
    question: How does the presence of fillers (talc, glass) in polypropylene composites
      affect laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares polypropylene for ultrasonic welding
      by removing surface contaminants without creating bonding barriers. Using a
      1064 nm wavelength at 1.2 J/cm² fluence ensures optimal surface energy modification.
      This controlled process enhances joint strength by preserving the polymer's
      integrity while achieving the required cleanliness.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for preparing polypropylene surfaces for
      ultrasonic welding?
