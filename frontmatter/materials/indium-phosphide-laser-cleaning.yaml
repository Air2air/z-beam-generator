title: Indium Phosphide Laser Cleaning
name: Indium Phosphide
settings_description: When laser cleaning Indium Phosphide, compare it to silicon,
  which absorbs laser energy more readily. Indium Phosphide tends to reflect more,
  so it demands gentler pulses to prevent surface cracking. I've seen this low absorption
  help avoid deep thermal damage, but it requires slower scan speeds to ensure complete
  contaminant removal without stressing the brittle structure. Unlike gallium arsenide,
  its dense, non-porous nature resists pitting, allowing tighter focus on oxide layers.
  This restores conductivity effectively when you keep energy low from the start.
  Start with defocused beams to expose underlying layers safely. Watch for micro-fractures
  if power creeps up too fast. In the end, always test a small area first to avoid
  irreversible brittleness issues.
