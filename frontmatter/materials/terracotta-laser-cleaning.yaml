title: Terracotta Laser Cleaning
subtitle: Notably, precision laser cleaning revives terracotta's porous texture, thus
  eliminating thermal damage risks.

description: 'When laser cleaning terracotta, watch out for its porous nature right
  from the start—it can trap heat unevenly and lead to cracks if you''re not careful.
  I''ve seen this happen when folks push too hard too soon, so begin by testing a
  small area with gentle pulses to gauge how the surface responds. This material tends
  to absorb laser energy moderately well, which helps remove dirt and grime without
  much effort, but its low heat spreading means you should keep dwell times short
  to avoid localized overheating.


  Move to a multi-pass approach next, starting low on power and building up only as
  needed. Terracotta''s relative fragility compared to denser stones calls for wider
  scan overlaps, ensuring even coverage without stressing the structure. What sets
  it apart is that baked-clay makeup, so it cleans up beautifully for heritage pieces
  but demands you pause between passes to let it cool. Avoid high speeds early on;
  slower ones prevent surface pitting. In my experience, this setup preserves the
  earthy texture while stripping away years of buildup safely.'
