caption:
  before: The microscopy reveals a contaminated terracotta surface, rough and porous with fine dust particles and organic
    residues clinging to the clay. This buildup clogs pores, causes discoloration, and promotes minor cracking. Such degradation
    weakens its role in architecture and cultural heritage.
  after: The cleaned terracotta surface looks smooth and fresh, with its warm reddish tone fully restored. Laser treatment
    removes dirt and old stains gently, and it preserves the material's porous texture without any cracks. This restoration
    quality is reliable for cultural heritage sites and buildings. It demonstrates careful integrity in processing.

  questions:
  - answer: For terracotta cleaning, 1064 nm near-infrared lasers excel by matching the absorption of iron oxides and clays,
      avoiding cracking or discoloration—unlike 532 nm, which risks deeper heating. Aim for 2.5 J/cm² fluence, and always
      validate on sample tiles first.
    question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning terracotta surfaces without causing cracking or discoloration?
  - answer: Terracotta's high porosity allows laser light at 1064 nm to seep deeper into pores, raising subsurface heating
      risks during embedded salt or dirt removal. To prevent structural weakening, dial pulse energy to 2.5 J/cm² with 10
      ns widths, balancing ablation efficiency and thermal control for safe cleaning.
    question: How does the high porosity of terracotta impact the laser cleaning process, particularly in removing embedded
      salts or dirt?
  - answer: When laser-cleaning terracotta artifacts at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a 1064 nm beam, prioritize robust ventilation
      systems to trap silica-laden clay particles and any fumes. Operators should don N95 masks, goggles, and gloves for dust
      protection. For painted surfaces, closely watch surface temperatures to avoid pigment degradation from localized heating.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when using lasers to clean terracotta artifacts, especially regarding airborne
      clay particles or fumes?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning removes black crusts from historical terracotta facades effectively through layer-by-layer
      ablation, sparing the fragile clay matrix. At 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it outperforms mechanical scraping
      by minimizing erosion, as shown in European architectural restorations.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove black crusts from historical terracotta facades without damaging the underlying
      clay matrix?
  - answer: For cleaning terracotta pottery in archaeological settings, I recommend nanosecond pulses around 10 ns at a fluence
      of 2.5 J/cm² using a 1064 nm wavelength. This short-pulse approach ablates organic residues selectively while sparing
      the delicate surface patina, unlike longer pulses that risk deeper thermal damage. Adjust scan speed to 500 mm/s for
      even coverage.
    question: What are the optimal pulse durations and fluences for cleaning terracotta pottery in archaeological contexts?
  - answer: Terracotta's low thermal conductivity traps heat during laser treatment, risking localized cracks at 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence. Scanning at 500 mm/s with 50% overlap promotes dissipation, boosting cleaning efficiency equally for glazed
      and unglazed surfaces while using 100 W power.
    question: How does the low thermal conductivity of terracotta affect heat buildup during laser surface treatment?
  - answer: Terracotta's inherent porosity can heighten re-wetting risks after laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a
      1064 nm wavelength, potentially accelerating weathering on roofs. Pairing the process with hydrophobic coatings enhances
      water repellency, ensuring long-term outdoor durability by mitigating moisture ingress.
    question: Are there specific concerns about laser cleaning terracotta roofs, such as potential for water absorption post-treatment?
  - answer: When cleaning terracotta with a 1064 nm laser at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, carbonates in impurities like calcite can
      thermally decompose into lime and CO₂, while sulfates may release SO₂, creating off-gassing hazards that require ventilation.
      Pre-cleaning spectroscopic scans help detect these minerals, allowing safe parameter tweaks to avoid substrate damage.
    question: What chemical reactions might occur when lasers interact with mineral impurities in terracotta during cleaning?
  - answer: In museum conservation of terracotta, ICOM-CC guidelines stress non-destructive testing like spectroscopy before
      and after cleaning to safeguard the porous substrate. EN standards mandate detailed documentation of parameters, such
      as 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, ensuring uniform removal of contaminants without thermal stress on the
      fragile material.
    question: How do industry standards guide the use of laser cleaning for terracotta in museum conservation projects?
