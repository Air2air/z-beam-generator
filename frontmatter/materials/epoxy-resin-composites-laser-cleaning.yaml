caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the epoxy resin composite surface appears rough, notably
    dotted with fine dust particles and oily residues. Thus, this leads to pitting,
    alongside slight degradation.
  after: After cleaning, the epoxy resin composite's surface now appears smooth and
    even, particularly free from contaminants like oils or particles. This restoration
    shows solid quality while preserving the material's integrity, with no damage
    to its layered structure. Thus, the process effectively revives functionality,
    upholding strength and durability for routine applications.

faq:
- answer: Yes, by precisely controlling the 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence,
    selective ablation of the epoxy matrix is achievable. Specifically, the laser's
    energy needs absorption in the resin first, thus blocking penetration to underlying
    fibers and averting their exposure or thermal damage.
  question: Can you safely remove epoxy resin from a composite surface with a laser
    without damaging the underlying carbon or glass fibers?
  topic_keyword: carbon or glass fibers
  topic_statement: Selective epoxy matrix ablation
- answer: For cleaning epoxy composites, 355 nm UV lasers are particularly optimal.
    Specifically, this wavelength enables photochemical ablation below the 2.5 J/cm²
    fluence threshold, efficiently breaking molecular bonds without significant heat
    generation. Thus, it prevents thermal degradation that causes yellowing, preserving
    the polymer matrix's chemical integrity.
  question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm, or 355nm) for
    cleaning epoxy composite surfaces without causing yellowing or chemical changes?
  topic_keyword: yellowing or chemical changes
  topic_statement: 355nm enables photochemical ablation
- answer: By employing nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength and fluence exceeding
    2.5 J/cm², we specifically target contaminants for ablation. Notably, this approach
    vaporizes surface layers without melting the epoxy, thus lifting material away
    to avoid infusion.
  question: How do you clean contaminated epoxy composites (e.g., mold release, grease,
    paint) with a laser without just embedding the contaminants deeper?
  topic_keyword: embedding the contaminants deeper
  topic_statement: Ablates without melting epoxy
- answer: Yes, specifically at 2.5 J/cm², laser ablation of epoxy composites releases
    hazardous pyrolysis byproducts, notably benzene and phenol. Thus, operators require
    a high-efficiency fume extraction system with HEPA and activated carbon filtration,
    plus proper respiratory protection.
  question: Does laser cleaning epoxy composites release hazardous fumes, and what
    specific filtration or extraction is required?
  topic_keyword: release hazardous fumes
  topic_statement: Releases benzene phenol byproducts
- answer: For controlled epoxy resin ablation, particularly maintain fluence around
    2.5 J/cm² using a 50 µm spot size. Thus, fine-tune the number of passes along
    with 50% beam overlap to accurately control depth removal on irregular composite
    surfaces.
  question: What laser parameters should I use to ablate a precise depth of epoxy
    resin for repair or inspection purposes?
  topic_keyword: ablate a precise depth
  topic_statement: 2.5 J/cm² fluence with overlap
- answer: Laser cleaning, particularly at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, activates epoxy composites
    by elevating surface energy and forming micro-roughness. This thus delivers strong
    adhesion preparation, commonly avoiding extra steps like abrasion, unlike mechanical
    techniques that typically introduce contaminants.
  question: After laser cleaning an epoxy composite, is the surface properly activated
    for bonding, or does it require a secondary treatment?
  topic_keyword: activated for bonding
  topic_statement: Eliminates secondary treatments
- answer: Hazing typically stems from fluence exceeding 2.5 J/cm², which thermally
    degrades the epoxy matrix. Notably, this generates micro-roughness through selective
    resin removal. Thus, target a scan speed around 500 mm/s while controlling overlap
    to curb heat buildup and yield a clearer surface.
  question: Why does my laser-cleaned epoxy composite surface sometimes look hazy
    or have a changed texture?
  topic_keyword: changed texture
  topic_statement: Excessive fluence degrades epoxy matrix
- answer: Laser cleaning removes carbonized epoxy effectively, but specifically demands
    precise fluence control around 2.5 J/cm². The char layer's altered absorption
    indicates risks to underlying fibers, thus requiring careful parameter tuning
    for selective ablation of residue while sparing the composite substrate.
  question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing carbonized epoxy after a fire
    or thermal event?
  topic_keyword: carbonized epoxy
  topic_statement: Requires precise fluence control
- answer: Laser cleaning surpasses traditional methods, particularly by selectively
    removing epoxy at 2.5 J/cm² fluence without harming underlying fibers. As a non-contact
    approach, it avoids secondary waste from grit or chemicals, thus providing better
    surface preservation. Precise control at 500 mm/s scan speeds delivers consistent,
    high-quality outcomes for vital aerospace and marine parts.
  question: How does the performance of laser cleaning epoxy composites compare to
    traditional methods like grit blasting or chemical stripping?
  topic_keyword: epoxy composites
  topic_statement: Selective removal without fiber damage
- answer: Beyond standard laser protocols, a primary concern involves toxic fume generation
    during the 1064 nm ablation process. Particularly at the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold,
    epoxy decomposes into hazardous compounds, thus requiring integrated fume extraction
    with real-time air monitoring to shield personnel from these carcinogenic byproducts.
  question: What are the critical safety considerations when using a high-power laser
    on an epoxy composite, beyond standard laser safety?
