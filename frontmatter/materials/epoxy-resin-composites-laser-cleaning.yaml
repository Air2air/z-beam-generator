caption:
  before: Microscopy shows the epoxy resin composite surface rough and dotted with fine dust particles and oily residues. This causes pitting, and slight degradation appears.
  after: The cleaned surface of the epoxy resin composite now looks smooth and even, free from contaminants like oils or particles. This restoration demonstrates good quality, and it preserves the material's integrity without any damage to its layered structure. The process restores functionality effectively, keeping strength and durability intact for everyday applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, with precise 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence control, you can selectively ablate the epoxy matrix. The key is ensuring the laser's energy is absorbed by the resin before penetrating to the underlying fibers, thus preventing their exposure or thermal degradation.
    question: Can you safely remove epoxy resin from a composite surface with a laser without damaging the underlying carbon or glass fibers?
  - answer: For epoxy composite cleaning, 355nm UV lasers are optimal. This wavelength enables photochemical ablation below the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold, efficiently breaking molecular bonds without significant heat generation. This process prevents the thermal degradation that causes yellowing, preserving the chemical integrity of the polymer matrix.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm, or 355nm) for cleaning epoxy composite surfaces without causing yellowing or chemical changes?
  - answer: Using nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence above 2.5 J/cm², we selectively ablate contaminants. This process vaporizes surface layers without melting the epoxy, effectively lifting material away to prevent infusion.
    question: How do you clean contaminated epoxy composites (e.g., mold release, grease, paint) with a laser without just embedding the contaminants deeper?
  - answer: Yes, laser ablation of epoxy composites at 2.5 J/cm² releases hazardous pyrolysis byproducts like benzene and phenol. You must use a high-efficiency fume extraction system with HEPA and activated carbon filtration, coupled with appropriate respiratory protection for operators.
    question: Does laser cleaning epoxy composites release hazardous fumes, and what specific filtration or extraction is required?
  - answer: For controlled epoxy resin ablation, maintain fluence near 2.5 J/cm² with a 50 µm spot size. Adjust the number of passes and a 50% beam overlap to precisely manage depth removal, even on uneven composite surfaces.
    question: What laser parameters should I use to ablate a precise depth of epoxy resin for repair or inspection purposes?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence activates epoxy composites by increasing surface energy and creating micro-roughness. This typically provides excellent adhesion readiness, often eliminating the need for secondary treatments like abrasion, unlike mechanical methods that can leave contaminants.
    question: After laser cleaning an epoxy composite, is the surface properly activated for bonding, or does it require a secondary treatment?
  - answer: Hazing often results from excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm², which thermally degrades the epoxy matrix. This creates micro-roughness from selective resin removal. Optimize your scan speed near 500 mm/s and manage overlap to minimize heat accumulation for a clearer surface.
    question: Why does my laser-cleaned epoxy composite surface sometimes look hazy or have a changed texture?
  - answer: Laser cleaning can remove carbonized epoxy, but requires precise fluence control near 2.5 J/cm². The char layer's altered absorption risks damaging underlying fibers, demanding careful parameter tuning to selectively ablate residue without harming the composite substrate.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing carbonized epoxy after a fire or thermal event?
  - answer: Laser cleaning outperforms traditional methods by selectively removing epoxy at 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damaging underlying fibers. This non-contact process eliminates secondary waste from grit or chemicals, offering superior surface preservation. With precise control at 500 mm/s scan speeds, it ensures consistent, high-quality results for critical aerospace and marine components.
    question: How does the performance of laser cleaning epoxy composites compare to traditional methods like grit blasting or chemical stripping?
  - answer: Beyond standard laser protocols, the primary concern is toxic fume generation from the 1064 nm ablation process. At the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold, epoxy decomposes into hazardous compounds, necessitating integrated fume extraction with real-time air monitoring to protect personnel from these carcinogenic byproducts.
    question: What are the critical safety considerations when using a high-power laser on an epoxy composite, beyond standard laser safety?
