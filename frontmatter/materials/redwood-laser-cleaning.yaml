caption:
  before: Under microscopy, redwood's surface shows heavy-heavy contamination by dirt
    particles and organic residues. These cling tightly, degrading wood with pitting
    and discoloration. Surface appears rough-rough and damaged.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the redwood surface appears very-very smooth
    and clean, with dirt removed then contaminants eliminated thoroughly. The process
    restores natural grain patterns beautifully, so the wood looks renewed and vibrant.
    Material integrity remains intact, no burns or cracks appear, and strength stays
    preserved for long-lasting applications.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk redwood yang lunak, gunakan fluence 1.2 J/cm² dengan spot 100 µm
      untuk menghilangkan kontaminan tanpa merusak struktur selulernya. Kecepatan
      scan 500 mm/s dan overlap 50% memastikan pembersihan seragam, sementara pulsa
      10 ns memberikan kontrol ablasi yang optimal untuk material berpori ini.
    question: What laser settings work best for cleaning redwood without damaging
      the soft wood surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively eliminates mildew and biological growth from
      redwood surfaces through precise ablation at 1.2 J/cm². This process removes
      spores and surface contaminants without damaging the wood's lignin structure.
      Unlike chemical treatments, this dry method prevents immediate regrowth by thoroughly
      sanitizing the substrate at a microscopic level.
    question: How effectively does laser cleaning remove mildew and biological growth
      from redwood decks and siding?
  - answer: With optimal 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 1064 nm wavelength, laser cleaning
      selectively removes contaminants while preserving redwood's protective tannins.
      This non-abrasive process maintains the wood's inherent weather resistance,
      ensuring long-term durability for architectural and marine applications.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect redwood's natural weather resistance and
      tannin content?
  - answer: Laser cleaning with 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size effectively
      removes contaminants from redwood without hydrating the fibers. This non-contact
      process avoids grain raising, unlike sanding, creating an ideal porous surface
      for uniform stain or sealant adhesion.
    question: Can laser cleaning prepare redwood surfaces for staining or sealing
      without raising the grain?
  - answer: Redwood's natural resins require robust fume extraction due to hazardous
      particulates. At the optimal 1.2 J/cm² fluence, use local ventilation with HEPA/activated
      carbon filtration to capture volatile organic compounds and sub-micron aerosols
      generated during ablation.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning redwood due to
      its resin content?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² selectively ablates grayed surface contaminants
      from Redwood, preserving the sound wood beneath. This non-contact method offers
      superior control over traditional abrasives, safeguarding the material's historical
      integrity with 100 µm precision.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods for restoring
      aged redwood structures?
  - answer: Deep iron-tannate staining poses significant challenges as the 1.2 J/cm²
      fluence threshold can be insufficient for complete removal. Embedded metallic
      particles may reflect the 1064 nm wavelength, risking localized thermal damage
      and requiring meticulous parameter adjustment to avoid wood substrate charring.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for redwood with deep staining
      or embedded metal particles?
  - answer: Dengan parameter optimal seperti fluence 1,2 J/cm² dan spot size 100 μm,
      pembersihan laser pada redwood dapat mempertahankan warna alaminya. Pengaturan
      termal yang tepat mencegah perubahan warna dengan mengablasikan kontaminan sebelum
      panas meresap ke serat kayu.
    question: Does laser cleaning alter the color of redwood or cause any discoloration
      effects?
  - answer: Redwood's poor thermal conductivity, typically 0.1 W/m·K, severely restricts
      heat dissipation, elevating charring risks. We mitigate this by using a 1.2
      J/cm² fluence threshold and rapid 500 mm/s scanning to limit energy deposition.
      This strategy prevents thermal degradation in the low-density cellular structure.
    question: How does redwood's low thermal conductivity affect laser cleaning efficiency
      and heat buildup?
  - answer: Clear heartwood responds well to 1.2 J/cm² fluence, effectively removing
      contaminants without damage. Knotty areas, being denser and resinous, require
      careful power modulation below 100 W to prevent localized charring. The 1064
      nm wavelength is optimal for lignin interaction, ensuring uniform cleaning across
      these distinct grain structures.
    question: What laser cleaning results can be expected on different redwood grades
      (clear vs. knotty)?
