caption:
  before: Microscopy of the untreated marble surface reveals heavy contamination by
    atmospheric particulates and organic biofilms, manifesting as irregular dark encrustations
    and diffuse soiling. Visible degradation includes surface pitting, microcracks
    from weathering, and localized discoloration, indicating compromised structural
    integrity and aesthetic deterioration.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy illustrates a highly restored marble surface,
    with thorough ablation of contaminants exposing the underlying calcite crystalline
    structure and intergranular porosity. The treatment achieves superior restoration
    quality, featuring smooth topography, intact material integrity, minimal thermal
    discoloration, and preserved microstructural features without substrate damage
    or excessive ablation.

  questions:
  - answer: Ya, laser dapat membersihkan graffiti dari marmer dengan aman menggunakan
      parameter spesifik seperti fluence 2.5 J/cm² dan spot size 100 µm. Kunci suksesnya
      adalah menghindari kejutan termal dengan pulse duration 10 ns. Selalu uji di
      area tersembunyi dulu untuk memastikan tidak terjadi perubahan warna atau etching
      pada permukaan batuannya.
    question: Can you safely use a laser cleaner to remove graffiti from marble without
      damaging the surface?
  - answer: For white Carrara marble, 1064nm at 2.5 J/cm² is typically optimal. However,
      darker marbles and stains absorb shorter wavelengths more efficiently, often
      necessitating 532nm to prevent thermal damage to the calcite substrate. The
      choice hinges on the specific contaminant's absorption profile versus the stone's
      mineral composition.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning
      different types of marble (e.g., white Carrara vs. dark marble)?
  - answer: We utilize a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² to selectively ablate black
      crusts. This fluence vaporizes iron oxides and biological growth without exceeding
      the marble's damage threshold, thus preventing subsurface calcination and shadowing.
    question: How do you remove black crusts or biological growth (lichens, algae)
      from marble with a laser without leaving a shadow or etch mark?
  - answer: Untuk mencegah yellowing pada Marmer, gunakan fluence rendah ~2.5 J/cm²
      dan pulsa nanodetik. Parameter ini mengablasikan kontaminan tanpa mentransfer
      panas berlebih yang mengubah kimia permukaan batu kapur sensitif ini.
    question: What are the critical laser parameters (fluence, pulse duration, repetition
      rate) to avoid the yellowing or burning of marble during cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes soot using 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 50
      kHz pulses. However, acidic smoke residues can permanently etch the marble surface;
      this chemical alteration is irreversible and cannot be remedied by the laser
      process.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing smoke or fire damage from marble
      surfaces, and what are the limitations?
  - answer: Water assist serves as a heat sink, suppressing plasma shielding and preventing
      thermal shock in the marble at our typical 2.5 J/cm² fluence. Concurrently,
      an air jet removes ablation debris from the beam path, ensuring consistent cleaning
      efficiency and protecting the delicate calcite matrix.
    question: Why is water or air-assist often used during laser cleaning of marble,
      and what are the pros and cons?
  - answer: Veins and fissures concentrate stress, requiring reduced fluence below
      2.5 J/cm². Avoid prolonged exposure on these features to prevent spalling, using
      a wider spot size and faster scan speeds to manage thermal input effectively.
    question: How does the presence of veins, fissures, and existing cracks in marble
      affect the laser cleaning strategy?
  - answer: Laser ablation of marble at 2.5 J/cm² generates fine calcium carbonate
      dust and hazardous contaminants. A HEPA-filtered extraction system is mandatory
      to capture these sub-100µm particles, and respiratory PPE must always be worn
      by the operator.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning marble, especially
      in terms of fume extraction?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² ablates contaminants but inherently creates
      a micro-rough, matte surface on marble. The original polished finish is not
      restored by the laser process itself. To regain the desired gloss, subsequent
      mechanical polishing steps like honing are required after the surface has been
      thoroughly cleaned.
    question: Can laser cleaning restore the polished finish of marble, or will it
      leave a matte surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior selectivity, removing black crust at ~2.5
      J/cm² while preserving the marble's historical patina. This non-contact method
      eliminates chemical residue risks from poultices and provides precise control
      with a 100 µm spot, preventing substrate damage. It is ideal for delicate heritage
      surfaces where material integrity is paramount.
    question: For a conservator, what are the advantages of laser cleaning marble
      monuments over traditional methods like poultices or chemical gels?
