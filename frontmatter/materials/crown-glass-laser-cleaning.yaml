caption:
  before: Under microscope, Crown glass surface appears very-very rough and contaminated.
    Dust particles and oily residues cling-cling tightly, forming clusters that scatter
    light irregularly. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and pits, etched-etched
    by contaminants over time. This condition reduces clarity and invites further
    damage, so careful cleaning is needed then.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Crown Glass surface is restored very-very
    smoothly and appears pristine, shiny. Contaminants are removed then polished away,
    so no scratches or haze remain. Material integrity stays intact perfectly, with
    high restoration quality that maintains optical clarity for general applications.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk Crown Glass, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluence 1.2 J/cm² dan
      pulsa 8 ns. Parameter ini mengoptimalkan penyerapan energi oleh kontaminan permukaan
      sambil menjaga energi di bawah ambang batas kerusakan material, sehingga mencegah
      microfracture dan modifikasi permanen pada substrat kaca.
    question: What are the specific laser parameters (wavelength, fluence, pulse duration)
      for safely cleaning contaminants from Crown Glass without causing damage or
      microfractures?
  - answer: Crown Glass's minimal thermal expansion, typically around 8.0 x 10⁻⁶/°C,
      significantly reduces stress cracking risks during laser cleaning. This allows
      us to safely apply a 1.2 J/cm² fluence for contaminant removal, a threshold
      that would pose greater thermal shock hazards for higher-expansion glass types
      like soda-lime.
    question: How does the low thermal expansion coefficient of Crown Glass affect
      laser cleaning compared to other glass types?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 50 μm spot
      size avoids permanent refractive index changes in Crown Glass. The key is maintaining
      parameters below the material's damage threshold, which preserves optical integrity
      without distortion.
    question: Can laser cleaning cause permanent refractive index changes or optical
      distortion in Crown Glass components?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels at removing organic residues like fingerprints and
      thin adhesives from Crown Glass. Using 1064 nm wavelength at 1.2 J/cm² effectively
      ablates these contaminants without damaging the substrate, unlike solvents which
      can leave streaks or require mechanical contact.
    question: What specific contaminants on Crown Glass (fingerprints, adhesives,
      coatings) respond best to laser cleaning versus traditional methods?
  - answer: BK7's minimal dopants yield excellent 1064 nm transmission, allowing safe
      cleaning at 1.2 J/cm². In contrast, variants with cerium or other absorbing
      ions risk thermal stress, requiring significantly lower fluence to prevent subsurface
      damage.
    question: Are there particular Crown Glass compositions (e.g., BK7, other crown
      variants) that are more or less suitable for laser cleaning?
  - answer: Crown Glass requires strict fluence control below 1.2 J/cm² to prevent
      subsurface fracture. Its transparency at 1064 nm creates significant reflection
      hazards, while brittle failure generates hazardous fine particulates, demanding
      enhanced containment and real-time monitoring not typically needed for metals.
    question: What safety considerations are unique to laser cleaning Crown Glass
      compared to metals or other materials?
  - answer: We verify Crown Glass quality using white-light interferometry for surface
      roughness below 1 nm RMS and spectrophotometry to confirm optical transmission
      remains above 99.5%. Non-destructive microscopic inspection at 200x magnification
      ensures no subsurface cracking from the 1.2 J/cm² fluence.
    question: How do you verify the surface quality and optical performance of Crown
      Glass after laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning's higher initial investment delivers superior economics
      for Crown Glass optics. With precise 1.2 J/cm² fluence control, it eliminates
      consumable costs and prevents surface damage, maximizing yield and throughput
      in high-value manufacturing like aerospace components.
    question: What are the economic considerations of laser cleaning Crown Glass versus
      traditional cleaning methods for high-value optical components?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes anti-reflection coatings from Crown
      Glass using selective ablation at 1.2 J/cm². Precise nanosecond pulses at 1064
      nm wavelength ensure the thin film absorbs energy while the transparent substrate
      remains undamaged. Critical process control of parameters like a 50 µm spot
      size and 500 mm/s scan speed is essential for preserving the pristine glass
      surface.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to remove anti-reflection coatings or other
      thin films from Crown Glass without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: Pre-existing flaws in Crown Glass significantly lower the safe operational
      fluence below the typical 1.2 J/cm² threshold. The 1064 nm laser energy can
      be absorbed by subsurface damage, causing localized thermal stress and catastrophic
      crack propagation. A meticulous pre-cleaning assessment using microscopy is
      essential to identify and map these critical defects for process parameter adjustment.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for Crown Glass with existing
      surface defects or subsurface damage?
