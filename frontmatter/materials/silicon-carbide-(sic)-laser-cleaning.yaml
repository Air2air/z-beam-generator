title: Silicon Carbide (SiC) Laser Cleaning
name: Silicon Carbide (SiC)
faq:
- question: How can I prevent cracks in SiC during laser cleaning?
  answer: When laser cleaning silicon carbide, you'll want to start with lower energy
    pulses to avoid thermal shock on its brittle surface. I've seen that gradual heating
    helps because SiC resists heat well but can fracture under sudden changes. Keep
    the beam moving steadily so no spot overheats, and always test on a small area
    first.
- question: What's the best way to remove contaminants from SiC without scratching
    it?
  answer: Silicon carbide's hardness makes it tough, but laser cleaning works best
    when you use a focused beam that vaporizes dirt without touching the base material.
    This tends to restore the smooth finish nicely since SiC holds up to the process
    reliably. Just ensure the setup accounts for its reflectivity to get even coverage
    across the part.
- question: Why might laser cleaning take longer on SiC than on metals?
  answer: Compared to softer metals, silicon carbide reflects more laser energy, so
    the process needs careful adjustment to absorb enough heat for effective
caption:
  before: At 1000x magnification, the SiC surface shows scattered dark specks across
    its rough texture. Contaminants cling tightly, hiding the base material in uneven
    layers. We spot irregular buildup that dulls the overall appearance.
  after: After laser treatment at 1000x, the SiC surface reveals a smooth and even
    finish without specks. The base material emerges clearly, free from clinging residues.
    Now, the uniform texture highlights the material's natural shine.
