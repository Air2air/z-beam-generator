title: Stainless Steel 304 Laser Cleaning
name: Stainless Steel 304
settings_description: We've found that when laser cleaning stainless steel 304, moderate
  power levels restore surfaces cleanly without excessive heat buildup. This approach
  works because the alloy's dense and non-porous nature allows the laser to remove
  oxides and contaminants efficiently while preserving the material's inherent corrosion
  resistance. In our experience, the moderate energy absorption of stainless steel
  304 means it heats up steadily, exposing a fresh layer beneath dirt or rust that
  stays durable and protective afterward. We typically adjust scan speeds to keep
  the process even, reducing the risk of uneven cleaning on its smooth base. Its strong
  mechanical properties further support this by maintaining structural integrity during
  the operation. However, watch for potential surface discoloration if power creeps
  too high, so always monitor temperatures closely to avoid compromising that long-term
  oxidation resistance.
material_description: When laser cleaning stainless steel 304, watch out for its tendency
  to hold heat longer than carbon steels. I've seen this lead to uneven surfaces if
  you push too hard. But its strong resistance to corrosion sets it apart, restoring
  a clean finish that stays protected longer. This works best when you keep pulses
  short and steady.

  before: The contaminated surface reveals irregular patches of dark residue clinging
    to the metal grains. Scattered specks of debris create uneven textures across
    the field of view. Rough edges and embedded particles obscure the underlying structure.
  after: Laser treatment restores a uniform shine to the exposed metal grains. Smooth
    contours replace the former debris, revealing clear boundaries between grains.
    The cleaned area displays consistent reflectivity without lingering irregularities.
