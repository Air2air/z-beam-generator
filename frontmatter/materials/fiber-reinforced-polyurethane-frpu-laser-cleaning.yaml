  before: Through microscopic examination, the FRPU surface reveals notable contamination
    from fine dust particles and oily residues. This essential degradation appears
    as micro-cracks and pitting, undermining structural integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane surface emerges smooth
    and uniform, cleared of contaminants and oxidation layers. Notably, this restoration
    excels by preserving the composite's structural integrity, with fibers intact
    and the polyurethane matrix undamaged. No thermal degradation arises, ensuring
    the material holds its original mechanical properties—essential for reliable use
    in demanding environments.

faq:
- answer: For FRPU cleaning, employ nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with a fluence around
    2.5 J/cm². This wavelength proves essential for absorption by contaminants and
    the polyurethane matrix, while the brief 10 ns pulse duration and 100 W power
    distinctly curb heat diffusion, safeguarding the sensitive fiber reinforcement
    from thermal degradation.
  question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
    for cleaning contaminants from FRPU without damaging the fiber reinforcement?
  topic_keyword: fiber reinforcement
  topic_statement: Nanosecond pulses limit heat diffusion
- answer: Keep fluence under 2.5 J/cm² by using a defocused 100 µm spot, essential
    for preventing polyurethane melting. Apply scan speeds above 500 mm/s with multiple
    passes to ablate material gradually. This strategy controls thermal load, sidestepping
    the notable sub-surface delamination from high energy density.
  question: When laser cleaning FRPU, how do I avoid melting the polyurethane surface
    or causing sub-surface delamination?
  topic_keyword: sub-surface delamination
  topic_statement: Low fluence multi-pass scanning
- answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power safely
    removes contaminants from FRPU. This preserves the fiber-matrix interface far
    better than abrasives, but post-process validation through bond strength testing
    is essential to confirm structural integrity.
  question: Is laser cleaning safe for FRPU, or will it degrade the material's mechanical
    properties and structural integrity?
  topic_keyword: structural integrity
  topic_statement: Preserves fiber-matrix interface
- answer: When lasing FRPU at 2.5 J/cm², it releases toxic isocyanates, hydrogen cyanide
    gas, and fine carbon fiber particulates. A notable aspect involves the HEPA filter
    managing particles, as a chemical scrubber captures the gases—while maintaining
    sufficient airflow for these essential byproducts.
  question: What specific safety hazards are created when lasing FRPU, and what extraction/filtration
    is required?
  topic_keyword: specific safety hazards
  topic_statement: Generates isocyanates HCN particulates
- answer: Indeed, lasers show notable effectiveness in removing release agents from
    FRPU composites. By applying low fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with a 100 µm spot size,
    we vaporize silicone residues without damaging the fiber reinforcement, which
    stays essential for a flawless clean surface.
  question: Can a laser effectively remove release agents and mold residues from FRPU
    composite parts after demolding?
- answer: Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength with 2.5 J/cm² fluence offers a distinct
    advantage by selectively ablating the polyurethane matrix, sparing the fibers—unlike
    abrasive blasting. This essential approach avoids media embedment, delivering
    a pristine surface for optimal adhesion without secondary waste, albeit with higher
    upfront costs.
  question: How does laser cleaning FRPU compare to traditional methods like dry ice
    blasting or plastic media blasting for adhesion preparation?
  topic_keyword: adhesion preparation
  topic_statement: Ablates matrix without fiber damage
- answer: For FRPU, it's essential to first check for a visually clean surface free
    of fiber damage. Quantitatively, employ dyne pens to ensure surface energy exceeds
    42 mN/m. Yet, the notable confirmation comes from a lap shear test on a coupon
    treated at 2.5 J/cm².
  question: What is the best way to validate the success of a laser cleaning process
    on FRPU before bonding or painting?
  topic_keyword: before bonding or painting
  topic_statement: Lap shear test validates adhesion
- answer: The notable conductivity and strong absorption of carbon fibers at 1064
    nm demand careful handling. It's essential to apply a reduced fluence of roughly
    2.5 J/cm² alongside a swift 500 mm/s scan speed, avoiding any scorching. In contrast,
    glass fibers' transparency supports higher energy density while preserving structural
    integrity.
  question: Why is the fiber type (glass vs. carbon) in FRPU critical for selecting
    a laser cleaning strategy?
- answer: The notable elasticity of polyurethane delivers inherent resistance to mechanical
    shock damage. Yet, thermal degradation remains the essential risk, countered through
    nanosecond pulses at 100 W and 1064 nm wavelength. For ultra-short pulses, fluence
    beyond ~2.5 J/cm² triggers stress-confinement effects, potentially leading to
    micro-cracking at the fiber-matrix interface.
  question: Does the high elasticity and toughness of polyurethane make it more or
    less susceptible to laser-induced shock damage?
