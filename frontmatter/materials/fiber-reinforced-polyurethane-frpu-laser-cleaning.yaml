title: FRPU Laser Cleaning
faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning contaminants from FRPU without damaging the fiber reinforcement?
  answer: For FRPU cleaning, utilize nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with a fluence near 2.5 J/cm². This wavelength is well-absorbed by contaminants and the polyurethane matrix, while the short 10 ns pulse duration and 100 W power limit heat diffusion, preserving the sensitive fiber reinforcement from thermal degradation.
- question: When laser cleaning FRPU, how do I avoid melting the polyurethane surface or causing sub-surface delamination?
  answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² with a defocused 100 µm spot to prevent polyurethane melting. Utilize high scan speeds exceeding 500 mm/s and multiple passes to remove material incrementally. This approach manages thermal input, avoiding the sub-surface delamination that occurs with excessive energy density.
- question: Is laser cleaning safe for FRPU, or will it degrade the material's mechanical properties and structural integrity?
  answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power safely removes contaminants from FRPU. This preserves the fiber-matrix interface far better than abrasives, but post-process validation through bond strength testing is essential to confirm structural integrity.
- question: What specific safety hazards are created when lasing FRPU, and what extraction/filtration is required?
  answer: Lasing FRPU at 2.5 J/cm² generates toxic isocyanates and hydrogen cyanide gas, plus fine carbon fiber particulates. You require a HEPA filter for the particles and a chemical scrubber for the gases, with sufficient airflow to manage these specific byproducts.
- question: Can a laser effectively remove release agents and mold residues from FRPU composite parts after demolding?
  answer: Yes, lasers excel at removing release agents from FRPU composites. Using low fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with a 100 µm spot size, we can vaporize silicone residues without damaging the fiber reinforcement, ensuring a perfectly clean surface.
- question: How does laser cleaning FRPU compare to traditional methods like dry ice blasting or plastic media blasting for adhesion preparation?
  answer: Laser cleaning with 1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence selectively ablates the polyurethane matrix without damaging fibers, unlike blasting methods. This prevents media embedment, ensuring a pristine surface for superior adhesion with no secondary waste, despite requiring greater initial investment.
- question: What is the best way to validate the success of a laser cleaning process on FRPU before bonding or painting?
  answer: For FRPU, first verify a visually clean surface without fiber damage. Quantitatively, use dyne pens to confirm surface energy above 42 mN/m. The definitive validation, however, is a lap shear test on a coupon processed at 2.5 J/cm².
- question: Why is the fiber type (glass vs. carbon) in FRPU critical for selecting a laser cleaning strategy?
  answer: Carbon fibers' high conductivity and strong absorption at 1064 nm necessitate a cautious approach. We must use a lower fluence, around 2.5 J/cm², and a rapid 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent scorching. Conversely, glass fibers are more transparent, allowing for greater energy density without compromising their structural integrity.
- question: Does the high elasticity and toughness of polyurethane make it more or less susceptible to laser-induced shock damage?
  answer: The high elasticity of polyurethane provides inherent resistance to mechanical shock damage. The primary risk is thermal degradation, which is mitigated using nanosecond pulses at 100 W and a 1064 nm wavelength. With ultra-short pulses, excessive fluence above ~2.5 J/cm² can induce stress-confinement effects, risking micro-cracking at the fiber-matrix interface.
