caption:
  before: Through microscopic examination, the FRPU surface reveals notable contamination from fine dust particles and oily residues. This essential degradation appears as micro-cracks and pitting, undermining structural integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane surface emerges smooth and uniform, cleared of contaminants and oxidation layers. Notably, this restoration excels by preserving the composite's structural integrity, with fibers intact and the polyurethane matrix undamaged. No thermal degradation arises, ensuring the material holds its original mechanical properties—essential for reliable use in demanding environments.
faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning contaminants from FRPU without damaging the **fiber reinforcement**?
  answer: '**Nanosecond pulses limit heat diffusion**. For FRPU cleaning, employ nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with a fluence around 2.5 J/cm². This wavelength proves essential for absorption by contaminants and the polyurethane matrix, while the brief 10 ns pulse duration and 100 W power distinctly curb heat diffusion, safeguarding the sensitive fiber reinforcement from thermal degradation.'
- question: When laser cleaning FRPU, how do I avoid melting the polyurethane surface or causing **sub-surface delamination**?
  answer: '**Low fluence multi-pass scanning**. Keep fluence under 2.5 J/cm² by using a defocused 100 µm spot, essential for preventing polyurethane melting. Apply scan speeds above 500 mm/s with multiple passes to ablate material gradually. This strategy controls thermal load, sidestepping the notable sub-surface delamination from high energy density.'
- question: Is laser cleaning safe for FRPU, or will it degrade the material's mechanical properties and **structural integrity**?
  answer: '**Preserves fiber-matrix interface**. Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power safely removes contaminants from FRPU. This preserves the fiber-matrix interface far better than abrasives, but post-process validation through bond strength testing is essential to confirm structural integrity.'
- question: What **specific safety hazards** are created when lasing FRPU, and what extraction/filtration is required?
  answer: '**Generates isocyanates HCN particulates**. When lasing FRPU at 2.5 J/cm², it releases toxic isocyanates, hydrogen cyanide gas, and fine carbon fiber particulates. A notable aspect involves the HEPA filter managing particles, as a chemical scrubber captures the gases—while maintaining sufficient airflow for these essential byproducts.'
- question: Can a laser effectively remove release agents and mold residues from FRPU composite parts after demolding?
  answer: Indeed, lasers show notable effectiveness in removing release agents from FRPU composites. By applying low fluence around 2.5 J/cm² with a 100 µm spot size, we vaporize silicone residues without damaging the fiber reinforcement, which stays essential for a flawless clean surface.
- question: How does laser cleaning FRPU compare to traditional methods like dry ice blasting or plastic media blasting for **adhesion preparation**?
  answer: '**Ablates matrix without fiber damage**. Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength with 2.5 J/cm² fluence offers a distinct advantage by selectively ablating the polyurethane matrix, sparing the fibers—unlike abrasive blasting. This essential approach avoids media embedment, delivering a pristine surface for optimal adhesion without secondary waste, albeit with higher upfront costs.'
- question: What is the best way to validate the success of a laser cleaning process on FRPU **before bonding or painting**?
  answer: '**Lap shear test validates adhesion**. For FRPU, it''s essential to first check for a visually clean surface free of fiber damage. Quantitatively, employ dyne pens to ensure surface energy exceeds 42 mN/m. Yet, the notable confirmation comes from a lap shear test on a coupon treated at 2.5 J/cm².'
- question: Why is the fiber type (glass vs. carbon) in FRPU critical for selecting a laser cleaning strategy?
  answer: The notable conductivity and strong absorption of carbon fibers at 1064 nm demand careful handling. It's essential to apply a reduced fluence of roughly 2.5 J/cm² alongside a swift 500 mm/s scan speed, avoiding any scorching. In contrast, glass fibers' transparency supports higher energy density while preserving structural integrity.
- question: Does the **high elasticity and toughness** of polyurethane make it more or less susceptible to laser-induced shock damage?
  answer: '**Resists mechanical shock damage**. The notable elasticity of polyurethane delivers inherent resistance to mechanical shock damage. Yet, thermal degradation remains the essential risk, countered through nanosecond pulses at 100 W and 1064 nm wavelength. For ultra-short pulses, fluence beyond ~2.5 J/cm² triggers stress-confinement effects, potentially leading to micro-cracking at the fiber-matrix interface.'
