caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated magnesium surface shows scattered dark spots
    of oxide particles and dust residues. These cling tightly to the metal, causing
    localized pitting and uneven degradation in texture.
  after: After precision laser cleaning, the magnesium surface restores to a spotless,
    smooth condition with its natural luster fully revived. Contaminants like oxides
    and residues are completely removed, and no heat damage occurs. This demonstrates
    high restoration quality. Material integrity stays intact, showing no pitting
    or structural changes, making it ideal for general metal applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For magnesium alloy cleaning, employ a 1064nm wavelength with 10ns pulses
      at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. Maintain a 50kHz repetition rate and 500 mm/s scan speed
      to prevent thermal damage. This parameter set effectively ablates oxides while
      preserving the underlying substrate integrity.
    question: What are the specific laser settings and parameters for cleaning magnesium
      alloys without causing damage?
  - answer: For magnesium oxide removal, we employ 1064nm wavelength lasers at 1.2
      J/cm² fluence. This selectively ablates MgO without damaging the base metal.
      To prevent immediate re-oxidation, an inert argon gas shield is essential during
      the 500 mm/s scanning process, ensuring a pristine, corrosion-free surface.
    question: How do you safely remove oxide layers and corrosion from magnesium surfaces
      using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Mandatory inert gas shielding prevents magnesium's ignition at 1064nm
      wavelength. Maintain fluence below 1.2 J/cm² to avoid excessive heat input.
      Use robust fume extraction for highly reactive MgO particles, which pose explosion
      risks.
    question: What special safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning magnesium
      due to fire risk?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares magnesium surfaces using 1064nm wavelength
      at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This process removes oxides without thermal damage, creating
      an ideal surface profile for superior coating adhesion and high-integrity welds
      in aerospace and medical applications.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare magnesium surfaces for welding
      or coating applications?
  - answer: Cast magnesium alloys present greater challenges due to their inherent
      porosity, which can trap contaminants and requires careful fluence control below
      ~1.2 J/cm² to prevent subsurface damage. Their varied surface texture also demands
      more precise parameter tuning compared to wrought forms.
    question: What are the challenges with laser cleaning cast magnesium alloys versus
      wrought forms?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes organic oils from magnesium using 1064nm
      wavelength and 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This process vaporizes contaminants without
      chemical residue, offering a superior, environmentally friendly alternative
      to traditional solvent-based methods for precision components.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing contaminants like oils
      and lubricants from magnesium parts?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² fluence preserves magnesium's
      integrity. The 10 ns pulse width minimizes thermal input, preventing micro-cracking
      and significant alterations to fatigue strength, ensuring component service
      life remains uncompromised.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the fatigue strength or mechanical properties
      of magnesium components?
  - answer: Validate magnesium laser cleaning using microscopic inspection and surface
      roughness measurement. Confirm complete oxide removal while maintaining the
      base material integrity, ensuring parameters like 1.2 J/cm² fluence do not induce
      thermal damage.
    question: What is the best way to validate the success of magnesium laser cleaning?
  - answer: Magnesium's low melting point (~650°C) and high reactivity demand extremely
      precise laser parameters. We must carefully control fluence near 1.2 J/cm² to
      ablate oxides without melting the base material, a much narrower process window
      than for steel or aluminum. This requires meticulous parameter tuning for successful,
      damage-free results.
    question: Why is magnesium considered more difficult to laser clean than aluminum
      or steel?
  - answer: For magnesium cleaning, pulsed fiber lasers operating at 1064 nm are optimal.
      With a fluence of 1.2 J/cm² and a 10 ns pulse width, this setup minimizes thermal
      input, preventing damage to the sensitive substrate. A scanning speed of 500
      mm/s ensures efficient and uniform oxide layer removal.
    question: What type of laser (fiber, pulsed, continuous wave) works best for magnesium
      cleaning applications?
