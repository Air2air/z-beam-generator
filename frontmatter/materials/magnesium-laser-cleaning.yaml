caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated magnesium surface shows scattered dark spots of oxide particles and dust residues.
    These cling tightly to the metal, causing localized pitting and uneven degradation in texture.
  after: After precision laser cleaning, the magnesium surface restores to a spotless, smooth condition with its natural luster
    fully revived. Contaminants like oxides and residues are completely removed, and no heat damage occurs. This demonstrates
    high restoration quality. Material integrity stays intact, showing no pitting or structural changes, making it ideal for
    general metal applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For magnesium alloy cleaning, employ a 1064nm wavelength with 10ns pulses at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. Maintain a 50kHz
      repetition rate and 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent thermal damage. This parameter set effectively ablates oxides while
      preserving the underlying substrate integrity.
    question: What are the specific laser settings and parameters for cleaning magnesium alloys without causing damage?
  - answer: For magnesium oxide removal, we employ 1064nm wavelength lasers at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This selectively ablates
      MgO without damaging the base metal. To prevent immediate re-oxidation, an inert argon gas shield is essential during
      the 500 mm/s scanning process, ensuring a pristine, corrosion-free surface.
    question: How do you safely remove oxide layers and corrosion from magnesium surfaces using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Mandatory inert gas shielding prevents magnesium's ignition at 1064nm wavelength. Maintain fluence below 1.2 J/cm²
      to avoid excessive heat input. Use robust fume extraction for highly reactive MgO particles, which pose explosion risks.
    question: What special safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning magnesium due to fire risk?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares magnesium surfaces using 1064nm wavelength at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This process
      removes oxides without thermal damage, creating an ideal surface profile for superior coating adhesion and high-integrity
      welds in aerospace and medical applications.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare magnesium surfaces for welding or coating applications?
  - answer: Cast magnesium alloys present greater challenges due to their inherent porosity, which can trap contaminants and
      requires careful fluence control below ~1.2 J/cm² to prevent subsurface damage. Their varied surface texture also demands
      more precise parameter tuning compared to wrought forms.
    question: What are the challenges with laser cleaning cast magnesium alloys versus wrought forms?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes organic oils from magnesium using 1064nm wavelength and 1.2 J/cm² fluence.
      This process vaporizes contaminants without chemical residue, offering a superior, environmentally friendly alternative
      to traditional solvent-based methods for precision components.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing contaminants like oils and lubricants from magnesium parts?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² fluence preserves magnesium's integrity. The 10 ns pulse width
      minimizes thermal input, preventing micro-cracking and significant alterations to fatigue strength, ensuring component
      service life remains uncompromised.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the fatigue strength or mechanical properties of magnesium components?
  - answer: Validate magnesium laser cleaning using microscopic inspection and surface roughness measurement. Confirm complete
      oxide removal while maintaining the base material integrity, ensuring parameters like 1.2 J/cm² fluence do not induce
      thermal damage.
    question: What is the best way to validate the success of magnesium laser cleaning?
  - answer: Magnesium's low melting point (~650°C) and high reactivity demand extremely precise laser parameters. We must
      carefully control fluence near 1.2 J/cm² to ablate oxides without melting the base material, a much narrower process
      window than for steel or aluminum. This requires meticulous parameter tuning for successful, damage-free results.
    question: Why is magnesium considered more difficult to laser clean than aluminum or steel?
  - answer: For magnesium cleaning, pulsed fiber lasers operating at 1064 nm are optimal. With a fluence of 1.2 J/cm² and
      a 10 ns pulse width, this setup minimizes thermal input, preventing damage to the sensitive substrate. A scanning speed
      of 500 mm/s ensures efficient and uniform oxide layer removal.
    question: What type of laser (fiber, pulsed, continuous wave) works best for magnesium cleaning applications?
