description: '### Laser Cleaning Magnesium: Key Settings and Practical Tips


  Hello, I''m Ikmanda Roswati, a materials engineer from Indonesia with a Ph.D. in
  laser processing. I''ve handled magnesium in projects for aerospace parts, and it
  always requires a careful touch during cleaning. Magnesium is a lightweight metal
  that shines in applications like automotive components and medical devices, but
  its quirks make laser cleaning tricky. You need to adjust your setup to match its
  behavior, or you''ll risk damaging the surface. Let''s walk through what works and
  what to watch for, so you can get clean results without headaches.


  Magnesium''s biggest strength for laser cleaning is its low density—about 1.74 g/cm³—which
  keeps parts light and easy to maneuver during processing. This helps in industries
  like sports equipment or electronics, where you clean delicate assemblies without
  adding stress. But its high reflectivity, around 92-94% for common laser beams,
  is a major weakness. Most of the energy just bounces off, so the laser struggles
  to remove contaminants like oils or oxides. To fix this, start with a fluence just
  above the damage threshold, say 1.2 J/cm², and build up slowly. I recommend using
  a power of 100 W with a small spot size of 50 μm to focus the energy better. This
  way, you concentrate the beam without wasting power on reflection.


  What sets magnesium apart from steels or aluminums is its low absorption rate—only
  about 6-9% of the laser energy gets soaked in. That means your standard settings
  for other metals won''t cut it here; the process feels slower because the material
  doesn''t heat up as quickly. Adjust by increasing the repetition rate to 50 kHz
  and shortening pulse widths to 10 ns. These short bursts help zap contaminants without
  letting heat build up in the base metal. In my experience, this prevents warping
  on thin sheets used in marine or defense parts. Also, magnesium oxidizes fast in
  air, forming a thin layer that can trap dirt. The laser cleans it well, but you
  must work in a controlled environment—maybe with inert gas shielding—to avoid re-oxidation
  right after.


  One unusual property is magnesium''s high thermal conductivity, at 156 W/m·K, which
  spreads heat quickly across the surface. This is great for even cleaning on large
  panels, like in energy sector tooling, but it can lead to uneven removal if your
  scan speed is off. Set your speed to 500 mm/s and aim for 50% overlap between passes.
  Do two passes minimum to ensure you hit all spots without scorching. Because heat
  dissipates so fast, you get good thermal shock resistance—up to 52 K difference—which
  means the material handles quick temperature swings better than you might think.
  Use this to your advantage: ramp up power gradually during the first pass to test
  absorption on your specific alloy.


  Pitfalls? Absolutely, and the main one is ignition risk. Magnesium burns hot if
  it overheats, especially near its melting point of 650°C. Avoid high fluences over
  1.8 J/cm², as that''s the ablation threshold where you start vaporizing the metal
  itself. I''ve seen setups melt edges on automotive prototypes because operators
  pushed power too hard to compensate for reflectivity. Instead, lower the initial
  fluence and monitor with a thermal camera. If you''re cleaning cultural heritage
  items, like old magnesium artifacts, stick to even lower settings—maybe 80% of standard
  power—to preserve details. Another trap is its low hardness, just 38 HV, so aggressive
  cleaning can scratch or pit the surface. Counter this by keeping passes light and
  following with a gentle wipe-down.


  Magnesium''s reactivity also affects post-cleaning. It has poor corrosion resistance,
  with a potential of -2.37 V, so exposed surfaces pick up moisture and degrade fast.
  After lasering, apply a protective coating right away, especially for marine or
  outdoor uses. This keeps your clean surface intact longer. In electronics manufacturing,
  where precision matters, the zero porosity helps—no hidden voids to trap residues—but
  you still need to verify cleanliness with a simple wipe test or visual check under
  light.


  For scan patterns, go with a raster or zigzag on flat areas to cover evenly, and
  slow down to 300 mm/s on curves to avoid missing spots. Overlap at 50% ensures no
  gaps, particularly on porous contaminants like rust from salty environments. If
  you''re dealing with heavy buildup from manufacturing residues, preheat the part
  slightly—not over 100°C—to boost absorption without risking damage. This trick works
  well for defense components that arrive oily.


  In summary, cleaning magnesium demands patience and tweaks: low power starts, short
  pulses, and multiple passes to overcome its shininess and heat spread. Get these
  right, and you''ll remove contaminants cleanly while keeping the metal''s lightweight
  benefits. I''ve cleaned batches for medical devices this way, and it saves time
  in the long run. If your setup varies, test on scraps first—magnesium forgives small
  mistakes but punishes big ones. Reach out if you need setup specifics for your application.'
