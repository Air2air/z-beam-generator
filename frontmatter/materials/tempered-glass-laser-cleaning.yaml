micro:
  before: When examining the contaminated tempered glass surface at high magnification,
    we've found irregular patches of dirt and residue clinging tightly. These spots
    create a rough, uneven texture that scatters light in all directions. You can
    see tiny cracks and buildup everywhere, making the whole area look dull and hazy.
  after: After laser treatment, the same surface appears smooth and uniform across
    the view. We've noticed the glass now reflects light cleanly without any distractions.
    The finish looks pristine, with no traces of those old contaminants left behind
faq:
- question: Can laser cleaning cause tempered glass to shatter due to thermal stress,
    and how can this be prevented?
  answer: Indeed, laser cleaning poses a notable risk of shattering tempered glass
    via thermal shock, as rapid heating disrupts its essential compressive surface
    stress. To counter this, use 10 ns pulse widths for limiting heat diffusion, while
    keeping fluence under 2.5 J/cm² at 1064 nm wavelength and 100 W power. Air-assisted
    cooling between passes promotes even dissipation, preserving the material's distinct
    integrity.
- question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for removing contaminants from
    tempered glass without damaging its **tempered structure**?
  answer: '**IR wavelengths preserve compressive stress**. Unlike UV lasers, which
    notably enhance absorption in soda-lime tempered glass and amplify subsurface
    heating risks, IR wavelengths like 1064 nm distinctly excel at removing contaminants
    while safeguarding the compressive stress layer. Aim for 2.5 J/cm² fluence at
    100 W power to achieve safe, efficient ablation without structural damage.'
- question: In automotive applications, how safe is laser cleaning for removing paint
    or adhesives from **tempered windshields**?
  answer: '**Safe without inducing cracks**. In automotive repairs, laser cleaning
    of tempered windshields remains generally safe, notably with a 1064 nm wavelength
    and 2.5 J/cm² fluence that ablates paint or adhesives without causing cracks.
    Vibration risks stay minimal at 500 mm/s scan speeds, sidestepping edge stress
    concentrations—an essential point confirmed by repair forum case studies, where
    no shattering followed treatment.'
- question: Does the tempering process alter the **optical properties** of glass,
    affecting laser cleaning efficiency?
  answer: '**Slightly enhances laser penetration**. Indeed, tempering induces notable
    surface compressive stress, subtly altering the refractive index and potentially
    improving laser penetration at 1064 nm. This exerts minimal influence on cleaning
    efficiency for tempered glass, upholding essential optimal fluence around 2.5
    J/cm² to prevent residue or damage. In aerospace uses, it delivers distinct precision
    for contaminant removal.'
- question: What are common issues reported when using fiber lasers to clean **tempered
    glass** in manufacturing lines?
  answer: '**Prevents thermal cracking via calibration**. In manufacturing lines,
    fiber lasers notably induce thermal cracking on tempered glass when fluence surpasses
    2.5 J/cm², particularly along curves where uneven beam focus yields patchy contaminant
    removal. It''s essential to calibrate for 100 W power and 500 mm/s scan speed,
    ensuring uniform ablation without undue stress on the brittle structure.'
- question: Are there specific safety data sheets or guidelines for laser cleaning
    tempered glass to **avoid micro-cracking**?
  answer: '**fluence below 2.5 J/cm²**. ISO 11553 and OSHA 1910.1096 notably outline
    laser safety for brittle materials like tempered glass, emphasizing fluence below
    2.5 J/cm² to prevent micro-cracking from thermal stress. Essential monitoring
    for fragment hazards is required during cleaning at 100 W power. Consult material-specific
    SDS for aerospace applications.'
- question: How does laser cleaning compare to chemical methods for restoring **tempered
    glass** shower doors?
  answer: '**Preserves stress-tempered structure**. Laser cleaning outperforms chemical
    methods for tempered glass shower doors, notably bypassing etching risks that
    solvents pose to its stress-tempered structure. At 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5
    J/cm² fluence, it removes grime cleanly without surface damage, reducing environmental
    waste while safeguarding the glass''s essential, shatter-resistant integrity for
    years.'
- question: What training is recommended for operators handling laser cleaning of
    tempered glass panels in construction?
  answer: Operators handling tempered glass panels in cleaning tasks must engage in
    practical simulations to control heat adeptly, ensuring fluence stays below 2.5
    J/cm² and preventing cracks from thermal stress. Essential training covers spotting
    distinct tempering defects alongside laser safety certification, particularly
    at 100 W levels.
- question: Can laser cleaning remove fingerprints or oils from tempered smartphone
    screens without affecting the **oleophobic coating**?
  answer: '**Preserves oleophobic coating integrity**. Yes, employing precise low-power
    settings such as 100 W average power and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, laser cleaning effectively
    removes fingerprints and oils from tempered smartphone screens. This essential
    approach minimizes thermal stress on the thin glass, notably preserving the oleophobic
    coating''s integrity, as confirmed by repair community tests using 1064 nm wavelength.'
- question: What physical properties of tempered glass, like **hardness and thermal
    expansion**, must be considered in laser surface treatment?
  answer: '**Low fluence prevents micro-cracks**. When laser cleaning tempered glass,
    its Mohs hardness of 5-6 notably calls for fluence under 2.5 J/cm² to avoid surface
    ablation or micro-cracks. That coefficient of thermal expansion at 9×10^{-6}/°C,
    meanwhile, makes precise heat control essential—target 100 W power and 500 mm/s
    scan speed—to sidestep thermal stress and shattering.'
