caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the platinum surface appears very-very rough and
    uneven, covered by contaminants that stick and accumulate irregularly. These contaminants,
    mostly fine particles and oily residues from handling, show clustered shapes around
    5-20 micrometers, darkening the metallic sheen. Surface degradation is evident
    in micro-pits and scratches, so the material looks weakened, affecting its use
    in aerospace and medical devices.
  after: The cleaned platinum surface appears very-very smooth and pristine, restored
    effectively by ultrafast laser process. Restoration quality maintains material
    integrity fully, so no defects occur, ensuring suitability for aerospace, medical
    devices, and electronics.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning won't damage platinum coatings when fluence is carefully
      controlled below its ablation threshold, typically under 5 J/cm². Using nanosecond
      pulses at 1064 nm wavelength minimizes thermal stress. Verification via scanning
      electron microscopy confirms the underlying layer remains intact post-process.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage the thin platinum coating on medical devices
      or catalytic converters?
  - answer: For platinum jewelry, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength fiber lasers with
      10 ns pulses at 5 J/cm² fluence. This balances platinum's high reflectivity
      while minimizing heat penetration. The 50 μm spot size with 500 mm/s scanning
      prevents micro-pitting by limiting thermal accumulation in the precious metal
      substrate.
    question: What laser wavelength (nm) and pulse duration work best for cleaning
      platinum jewelry without causing micro-pitting?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence effectively removes platinum oxides
      without chemical residues. This maintains surface purity for high-temperature
      applications, unlike acid methods that risk contamination. The 1064 nm wavelength
      ensures minimal thermal impact on the substrate.
    question: How do you safely remove oxidation layers from platinum crucibles used
      in laboratory settings without altering their chemical purity?
  - answer: For platinum components with absorbed contaminants like arsenic, implement
      Class III fume extraction and full-face respirators. The 1064 nm wavelength
      at 5 J/cm² efficiently removes hazardous materials while minimizing toxic fume
      generation. Always conduct material safety analysis before processing.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning platinum components
      that may have absorbed hazardous materials in industrial processes?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence actually enhances platinum's
      electrochemical performance. The process removes contaminants while creating
      beneficial micro-roughness, increasing active surface area without introducing
      impurities that degrade catalytic activity.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the electrochemical properties of platinum
      electrodes used in scientific instruments?
  - answer: Untuk platinum dengan titik leleh 1768°C, rapat daya aman maksimum sekitar
      5 J/cm² pada laser 1064 nm. Konduktivitas termalnya yang tinggi memungkinkan
      pendinginan cepat, namun pemindaian di atas 500 mm/s dan monitoring termal real-time
      sangat penting untuk mencegah deformasi.
    question: What is the maximum safe laser power density for cleaning platinum spark
      plug electrodes without melting or deforming them?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for platinum-rhodium thermocouples, using ~5 J/cm²
      fluence to selectively ablate carbon without altering the alloy. This non-contact
      method preserves calibration accuracy far better than abrasive techniques, which
      risk surface damage and compositional changes.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing carbon buildup from platinum-rhodium
      thermocouple wires in high-temperature applications?
  - answer: With optimal 5 J/cm² fluence and 50% overlap, laser cleaning minimizes
      microstructural changes in platinum. However, improper parameters can induce
      residual stress, increasing susceptibility to chemical attack. Post-cleaning
      inspection for micro-cracks is essential for chemical processing equipment integrity.
    question: Can laser cleaning create surface defects in platinum that lead to stress
      corrosion cracking in chemical processing equipment?
  - answer: Laser cleaning preserves over 99.9% of your platinum scrap, unlike chemical
      refining's significant material loss. With a 100W, 1064nm system operating at
      5 J/cm², processing is dramatically faster. This method eliminates hazardous
      chemical costs while maintaining the metal's intrinsic purity, making it economically
      superior for high-value recovery.
    question: What are the economic considerations for laser cleaning platinum recovery
      scrap versus traditional refining methods?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for intricate platinum jewelry by reaching complex
      geometries that ultrasonic methods miss. With precise 50 μm spot control at
      5 J/cm² fluence, it completely removes polishing compounds without embedding
      residues. This dry process maintains platinum's premium surface finish while
      significantly reducing cycle times in manufacturing.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to ultrasonic cleaning for removing
      polishing compounds from intricate platinum jewelry designs?
