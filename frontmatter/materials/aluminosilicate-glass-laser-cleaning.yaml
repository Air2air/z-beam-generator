name: Aluminosilicate Glass
faq:
- question: How can I safely laser clean Aluminosilicate Glass without causing cracks?
  answer: We've found that Aluminosilicate Glass holds up much better than standard
    soda-lime glass during laser cleaning because of its superior toughness and resistance
    to thermal shock. In our experience, you start with lower pulse energies to gently
    remove contaminants, allowing the material's inherent strength to prevent micro-fractures
    that plague softer glasses. This approach keeps the surface intact while contrasting
    sharply with how regular glass might shatter under similar heat buildup. Just
    watch the dwell time closely to avoid any localized overheating at the end.
- question: What's the best way to remove stubborn stains from Aluminosilicate Glass
    using lasers?
  answer: When tackling tough stains on Aluminosilicate Glass, we typically contrast
    it with borosilicate types, where higher absorption leads to quicker but riskier
    ablation. Aluminosilicate's lower light uptake means you need steady, focused
    passes to build enough energy without overwhelming the surface, ensuring clean
    removal every time. We've seen great results by adjusting beam overlap slightly
caption:
  before: When examining the contaminated aluminosilicate glass surface at 1000x magnification,
    you notice irregular clumps of debris scattered across it, dulling the overall
    texture. Fine particles adhere stubbornly, creating a bumpy and hazy layer that
    obscures the underlying material. This buildup makes the surface look worn and
    inconsistent under close inspection.
  after: After laser treatment, you observe a remarkably even and polished surface
    emerging clearly at the same magnification. The debris vanishes completely, leaving
    behind a sleek, reflective finish without any remnants.
