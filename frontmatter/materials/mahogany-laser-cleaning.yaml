    - before: At 1000x magnification, the mahogany surface shows dark spots and fine
        dust layers covering the wood fibers. Grime clings tightly to the uneven texture,
        blocking the natural grain patterns below. Contaminants create a rough, mottled
        appearance across the entire area.
      after: After laser treatment at 1000x magnification, the surface reveals clear,
        exposed wood fibers without any residue. The grain patterns emerge smoothly,
        restoring the material's original even texture. Cleaning removes all visible
        dirt, leaving

  - - faq
    - - question: What are the optimal laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
          for cleaning soot and grime from mahogany without **damaging the wood surface**?
        answer: '**Preserves delicate lignin structure**. For mahogany, I''d typically
          go with a 1064 nm wavelength at 40 W average power and 100 ns pulses. Aim
          for fluence around 2.5 J/cm² plus a 500 mm/s scan speed to pretty effectively
          remove soot while safeguarding the wood''s delicate lignin structure. This
          basically avoids thermal damage and discoloration.'
      - question: How does the natural oil content in mahogany affect the laser cleaning
          process, and are there any special precautions needed?
        answer: 'Mahogany''s natural oils absorb the 1064 nm wavelength pretty well,
          so you''ll need careful fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to avoid resinous
          exudation. Fairly straightforward: hold average power at 40W with a 500
          mm/s scan speed to manage heat and prevent surface charring from volatile
          compounds.'
      - question: Can laser cleaning be used to remove old varnish or shellac from
          antique mahogany furniture without altering the **wood's patina**?
        answer: '**Preserves patina avoiding cellular damage**. Yeah, using a pretty
          precise 1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, laser ablation can typically
          strip away aged varnish selectively. This keeps the underlying mahogany''s
          patina intact by dodging thermal damage to the wood''s cellular structure.'
      - question: What is the risk of causing **color change or 'bleaching'** on mahogany
          when using a laser cleaner, especially on high-density areas like the grain?
        answer: '**2.5 J/cm² threshold prevents bleaching**. That 2.5 J/cm² fluence
          threshold is pretty critical; pushing beyond it risks photochemical bleaching,
          particularly on dense grain. At 1064 nm, lignin absorption often leads to
          fairly uneven lightening. Tight control of the 100 µm spot and 500 mm/s
          scan speed helps maintain original color integrity.'
      - question: Is fume extraction different for laser cleaning mahogany compared
          to other woods, given its **specific VOC profile** and potential for fine
          particulate?
        answer: '**Requires dual-stage HEPA filtration**. Mahogany''s higher lignin
          content typically generates finer particulates and fairly complex VOCs at
          your 2.5 J/cm² fluence. We recommend a dual-stage HEPA and activated carbon
          filtration system to capture these sub-micron aerosols and organic compounds
          effectively for operator safety.'
      - question: How do you test and validate laser cleaning parameters on a **sample
          of mahogany** before working on a valuable piece?
        answer: '**Tests for lignin disruption**. We typically kick off with test
          spots at a low fluence, say around 2.5 J/cm², then inspect the surface under
          magnification for lignin disruption. This fairly ensures a safe, repeatable
          protocol suited to mahogany''s unique cellular structure before tackling
          the full artifact.'
      - question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for **deeply embedded
          stains** or ink marks in mahogany compared to traditional chemical or mechanical
          methods?
        answer: '**Limited to 100μm penetration**. Laser cleaning typically struggles
          with deep stains exceeding its ~100μm spot penetration. At our 2.5 J/cm²
          fluence threshold, deeply embedded ink basically requires complementary
          chemical poultices to draw contaminants into the laser''s effective removal
          zone.'
      - question: After laser cleaning, does the surface of mahogany require any **special
          post-treatment** or conditioning before refinishing?
        answer: '**Vacuum open grain pores**. At 2.5 J/cm², our process fairly effectively
          decontaminates the surface. That said, you''ll typically still need to vacuum
          the open grain pores for optimal adhesion when applying oil or sealant to
          the cleaned mahogany.'
      - question: For laser cleaning large mahogany architectural elements (e.g.,
          paneling, doors), what scanning strategies and **beam overlap** are recommended
          to ensure uniform results?
        answer: '**Requires 30% beam overlap**. For large mahogany surfaces, apply
          a fairly generous 30% beam overlap and 500 mm/s scan speed to avoid tiger-striping.
          Pairing this with a 2.5 J/cm² fluence basically guarantees even contaminant
          removal, preserving the wood''s fine structure. Set robotic paths to deliver
          steady energy density across the full architectural feature.'
      - question: How does the porosity and **open grain structure** of mahogany influence
          the laser cleaning effectiveness for dirt trapped within the pores?
        answer: '**Requires multiple passes for pores**. Mahogany''s open grain poses
          a pretty tough cleaning challenge, with contaminants lodging deep in its
          pores. Our optimal 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size effectively ablate
          surface grime, but multiple passes at 500 mm/s are typically needed to gently
          address the pore structure without subsurface thermal damage or sealing
          the wood''s natural texture.'
