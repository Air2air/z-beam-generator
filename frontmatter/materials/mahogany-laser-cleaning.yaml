  before: At 1000x magnification, the mahogany surface shows dark spots and fine dust
    layers covering the wood fibers. Grime clings tightly to the uneven texture, blocking
    the natural grain patterns below. Contaminants create a rough, mottled appearance
    across the entire area.
  after: After laser treatment at 1000x magnification, the surface reveals clear,
    exposed wood fibers without any residue. The grain patterns emerge smoothly, restoring
    the material's original even texture. Cleaning removes all visible dirt, leaving
faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
    for cleaning soot and grime from mahogany without **damaging the wood surface**?
  answer: '**Preserves delicate lignin structure**. For mahogany, I''d typically go
    with a 1064 nm wavelength at 40 W average power and 100 ns pulses. Aim for fluence
    around 2.5 J/cm² plus a 500 mm/s scan speed to pretty effectively remove soot
    while safeguarding the wood''s delicate lignin structure. This basically avoids
    thermal damage and discoloration.'
- question: How does the natural oil content in mahogany affect the laser cleaning
    process, and are there any special precautions needed?
  answer: 'Mahogany''s natural oils absorb the 1064 nm wavelength pretty well, so
    you''ll need careful fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to avoid resinous exudation.
    Fairly straightforward: hold average power at 40W with a 500 mm/s scan speed to
    manage heat and prevent surface charring from volatile compounds.'
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to remove old varnish or shellac from antique
    mahogany furniture without altering the **wood's patina**?
  answer: '**Preserves patina avoiding cellular damage**. Yeah, using a pretty precise
    1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, laser ablation can typically strip away
    aged varnish selectively. This keeps the underlying mahogany''s patina intact
    by dodging thermal damage to the wood''s cellular structure.'
- question: What is the risk of causing **color change or 'bleaching'** on mahogany
    when using a laser cleaner, especially on high-density areas like the grain?
  answer: '**2.5 J/cm² threshold prevents bleaching**. That 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold
    is pretty critical; pushing beyond it risks photochemical bleaching, particularly
    on dense grain. At 1064 nm, lignin absorption often leads to fairly uneven lightening.
    Tight control of the 100 µm spot and 500 mm/s scan speed helps maintain original
    color integrity.'
- question: Is fume extraction different for laser cleaning mahogany compared to other
    woods, given its **specific VOC profile** and potential for fine particulate?
  answer: '**Requires dual-stage HEPA filtration**. Mahogany''s higher lignin content
    typically generates finer particulates and fairly complex VOCs at your 2.5 J/cm²
    fluence. We recommend a dual-stage HEPA and activated carbon filtration system
    to capture these sub-micron aerosols and organic compounds effectively for operator
    safety.'
- question: How do you test and validate laser cleaning parameters on a **sample of
    mahogany** before working on a valuable piece?
  answer: '**Tests for lignin disruption**. We typically kick off with test spots
    at a low fluence, say around 2.5 J/cm², then inspect the surface under magnification
    for lignin disruption. This fairly ensures a safe, repeatable protocol suited
    to mahogany''s unique cellular structure before tackling the full artifact.'
- question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for **deeply embedded stains**
    or ink marks in mahogany compared to traditional chemical or mechanical methods?
  answer: '**Limited to 100μm penetration**. Laser cleaning typically struggles with
    deep stains exceeding its ~100μm spot penetration. At our 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold,
    deeply embedded ink basically requires complementary chemical poultices to draw
    contaminants into the laser''s effective removal zone.'
- question: After laser cleaning, does the surface of mahogany require any **special
    post-treatment** or conditioning before refinishing?
  answer: '**Vacuum open grain pores**. At 2.5 J/cm², our process fairly effectively
    decontaminates the surface. That said, you''ll typically still need to vacuum
    the open grain pores for optimal adhesion when applying oil or sealant to the
    cleaned mahogany.'
- question: For laser cleaning large mahogany architectural elements (e.g., paneling,
    doors), what scanning strategies and **beam overlap** are recommended to ensure
    uniform results?
  answer: '**Requires 30% beam overlap**. For large mahogany surfaces, apply a fairly
    generous 30% beam overlap and 500 mm/s scan speed to avoid tiger-striping. Pairing
    this with a 2.5 J/cm² fluence basically guarantees even contaminant removal, preserving
    the wood''s fine structure. Set robotic paths to deliver steady energy density
    across the full architectural feature.'
- question: How does the porosity and **open grain structure** of mahogany influence
    the laser cleaning effectiveness for dirt trapped within the pores?
  answer: '**Requires multiple passes for pores**. Mahogany''s open grain poses a
    pretty tough cleaning challenge, with contaminants lodging deep in its pores.
    Our optimal 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size effectively ablate surface
    grime, but multiple passes at 500 mm/s are typically needed to gently address
    the pore structure without subsurface thermal damage or sealing the wood''s natural
    texture.'
