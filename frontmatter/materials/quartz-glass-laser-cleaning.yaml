caption:
  before: 'Under microscopy, the quartz glass surface appears very-very contaminated, with fine dust particles and oily residues
    scattered everywhere and then clustered in spots. Contaminants show irregular shapes, sizes from nanometers to microns,
    sticking tightly and blocking transparency. Surface degradation is evident: micro-pits form, edges roughen, and overall
    smoothness is lost, so the material looks dull and weakened.'
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface appears very-very smooth and clean, with dirt removed then
    shine restored quickly. Integrity stays strong, no cracks or damage seen, so material looks like new. Process cleans effectively
    and preserves optical properties well.

  questions:
  - answer: Quartz glass withstands up to 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damage. For safe operation, use a 1064 nm near-IR wavelength
      and maintain average power below 100 W to prevent devitrification. Proper parameter control ensures effective contaminant
      removal while preserving the substrate's structural integrity.
    question: Can quartz glass be damaged by laser cleaning systems, and what power/wavelength settings are safe?
  - answer: Quartz glass components maintain optical clarity from UV to IR wavelengths while withstanding intense laser exposure
      up to 2.5 J/cm². Its exceptionally low thermal expansion coefficient of 0.55 ppm/°C provides remarkable thermal stability,
      ensuring dimensional integrity during high-power 100W operations. This combination of high transmission and laser damage
      resistance makes it indispensable for protective windows and focusing lenses in cleaning systems.
    question: Why is quartz glass used for laser cleaning system components like protective windows and lenses?
  - answer: For quartz optics, use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence below 2.5 J/cm². This selectively
      ablates contaminants while the substrate's high transparency prevents damage. Follow with isopropyl alcohol and lint-free
      wipes for final residue removal.
    question: How do you clean laser-contaminated quartz optics without damaging them?
  - answer: Contaminants like metallic particles absorb the 1064 nm laser energy far more than quartz, causing intense localized
      heating. This thermal shock can induce stress exceeding the material's fracture toughness, leading to micro-cracks.
      Precise fluence control below ~2.5 J/cm² is critical to avoid this damage.
    question: What happens if laser cleaning is performed on contaminated quartz glass surfaces?
  - answer: Quartz glass's high 1064 nm transparency demands precise fluence control near 2.5 J/cm² to avoid beam transmission
      through thin sections. This transparency also necessitates stringent eye protection, as the laser energy can pass through
      the material directly.
    question: Does quartz glass transparency affect laser cleaning effectiveness and safety?
  - answer: Quartz glass offers superior UV transmission and thermal shock resistance up to 1100°C, while sapphire provides
      greater hardness. For our standard 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm², fused silica's lower cost and adequate durability
      are often optimal.
    question: How does quartz glass compare to other materials like sapphire for laser system windows?
  - answer: Clouding and discoloration indicate cumulative thermal damage from excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm². This increases
      scatter, reducing transmission efficiency and cleaning performance. Pitting and coating damage from incorrect 50% overlap
      also compromise the optic's integrity.
    question: What are the signs of quartz optic degradation in laser cleaning systems?
  - answer: Ya, pembersihan laser dapat menghilangkan deposit dari permukaan kuarsa tanpa merusak substrat. Dengan fluence
      2,5 J/cm² dan panjang gelombang 1064 nm, energi diserap lapisan namun ditransmisikan kaca, mempertahankan sifat optiknya.
      Kontrol proses yang ketat sangat penting.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove coatings or deposits from quartz surfaces without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent quartz substrate damage. Employ beam dumps and full optical enclosures
      to manage hazardous reflections and contain ejected debris. Continuously monitor for surface degradation, as even minor
      contamination can lead to localized heating and irreversible optic damage under the 1064 nm wavelength.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning near quartz components?
  - answer: Fused silica's superior UV transmission and low OH content (<5 ppm) enables efficient 1064 nm laser cleaning at
      2.5 J/cm² without thermal stress. Natural quartz, with higher impurity inclusions, risks localized absorption and micro-fractures,
      compromising process integrity and potentially damaging the substrate at standard laser parameters.
    question: How does quartz glass purity (fused silica vs. natural quartz) affect laser cleaning applications?
