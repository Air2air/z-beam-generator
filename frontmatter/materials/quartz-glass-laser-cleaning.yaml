caption:
  before: 'Under microscopy, the quartz glass surface appears very-very contaminated,
    with fine dust particles and oily residues scattered everywhere and then clustered
    in spots. Contaminants show irregular shapes, sizes from nanometers to microns,
    sticking tightly and blocking transparency. Surface degradation is evident: micro-pits
    form, edges roughen, and overall smoothness is lost, so the material looks dull
    and weakened.'
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean, with dirt removed then shine restored quickly. Integrity stays
    strong, no cracks or damage seen, so material looks like new. Process cleans effectively
    and preserves optical properties well.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Quartz glass withstands up to 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damage. For safe
      operation, use a 1064 nm near-IR wavelength and maintain average power below
      100 W to prevent devitrification. Proper parameter control ensures effective
      contaminant removal while preserving the substrate's structural integrity.
    question: Can quartz glass be damaged by laser cleaning systems, and what power/wavelength
      settings are safe?
  - answer: Quartz glass components maintain optical clarity from UV to IR wavelengths
      while withstanding intense laser exposure up to 2.5 J/cm². Its exceptionally
      low thermal expansion coefficient of 0.55 ppm/°C provides remarkable thermal
      stability, ensuring dimensional integrity during high-power 100W operations.
      This combination of high transmission and laser damage resistance makes it indispensable
      for protective windows and focusing lenses in cleaning systems.
    question: Why is quartz glass used for laser cleaning system components like protective
      windows and lenses?
  - answer: For quartz optics, use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence
      below 2.5 J/cm². This selectively ablates contaminants while the substrate's
      high transparency prevents damage. Follow with isopropyl alcohol and lint-free
      wipes for final residue removal.
    question: How do you clean laser-contaminated quartz optics without damaging them?
  - answer: Contaminants like metallic particles absorb the 1064 nm laser energy far
      more than quartz, causing intense localized heating. This thermal shock can
      induce stress exceeding the material's fracture toughness, leading to micro-cracks.
      Precise fluence control below ~2.5 J/cm² is critical to avoid this damage.
    question: What happens if laser cleaning is performed on contaminated quartz glass
      surfaces?
  - answer: Quartz glass's high 1064 nm transparency demands precise fluence control
      near 2.5 J/cm² to avoid beam transmission through thin sections. This transparency
      also necessitates stringent eye protection, as the laser energy can pass through
      the material directly.
    question: Does quartz glass transparency affect laser cleaning effectiveness and
      safety?
  - answer: Quartz glass offers superior UV transmission and thermal shock resistance
      up to 1100°C, while sapphire provides greater hardness. For our standard 1064
      nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm², fused silica's lower cost and adequate durability
      are often optimal.
    question: How does quartz glass compare to other materials like sapphire for laser
      system windows?
  - answer: Clouding and discoloration indicate cumulative thermal damage from excessive
      fluence above 2.5 J/cm². This increases scatter, reducing transmission efficiency
      and cleaning performance. Pitting and coating damage from incorrect 50% overlap
      also compromise the optic's integrity.
    question: What are the signs of quartz optic degradation in laser cleaning systems?
  - answer: Ya, pembersihan laser dapat menghilangkan deposit dari permukaan kuarsa
      tanpa merusak substrat. Dengan fluence 2,5 J/cm² dan panjang gelombang 1064
      nm, energi diserap lapisan namun ditransmisikan kaca, mempertahankan sifat optiknya.
      Kontrol proses yang ketat sangat penting.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove coatings or deposits from quartz surfaces
      without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent quartz substrate damage. Employ
      beam dumps and full optical enclosures to manage hazardous reflections and contain
      ejected debris. Continuously monitor for surface degradation, as even minor
      contamination can lead to localized heating and irreversible optic damage under
      the 1064 nm wavelength.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning near quartz components?
  - answer: Fused silica's superior UV transmission and low OH content (<5 ppm) enables
      efficient 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² without thermal stress. Natural
      quartz, with higher impurity inclusions, risks localized absorption and micro-fractures,
      compromising process integrity and potentially damaging the substrate at standard
      laser parameters.
    question: How does quartz glass purity (fused silica vs. natural quartz) affect
      laser cleaning applications?
