caption:
  before: 'Under microscopy, a straightforward view reveals the quartz glass surface
    as heavily contaminated, with fine dust particles and oily residues scattered
    across it and clustered in spots. Contaminants exhibit irregular shapes, sizes
    from nanometers to microns, adhering tightly and impairing transparency. Through
    this process, surface degradation stands out: micro-pits emerge, edges roughen,
    and overall smoothness fades, leaving the material dull and compromised.'
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface becomes very smooth
    and clean, with dirt removed efficiently and shine restored quickly. Integrity
    remains strong, showing no cracks or damage, so the material looks like new. This
    process cleans effectively while preserving optical properties well.

faq:
- answer: Quartz glass handles up to 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damage in a straightforward
    manner. For safe operation, stick to a 1064 nm near-IR wavelength and keep average
    power under 100 W to avoid devitrification. This process of proper parameter control
    ensures contaminant removal efficiently while preserving substrate integrity.
  question: Can quartz glass be damaged by laser cleaning systems, and what power/wavelength
    settings are safe?
  topic_keyword: power/wavelength settings
  topic_statement: Withstands 2.5 J/cm² prevents devitrification
- answer: Quartz glass components deliver straightforward optical clarity across UV
    to IR wavelengths, enduring intense laser exposure up to 2.5 J/cm². Featuring
    an exceptionally low thermal expansion coefficient of 0.55 ppm/°C, it ensures
    remarkable thermal stability and dimensional integrity during high-power 100W
    operations. This blend of high transmission and laser damage resistance proves
    indispensable for protective windows and focusing lenses in cleaning systems.
  question: Why is quartz glass used for laser cleaning system components like protective
    windows and lenses?
  topic_keyword: protective windows and lenses
  topic_statement: Low thermal expansion ensures stability
- answer: For quartz optics, a straightforward approach is to use nanosecond pulses
    at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence below 2.5 J/cm². This selectively ablates contaminants,
    as the substrate's high transparency avoids damage. That method works well, followed
    by isopropyl alcohol and lint-free wipes for final residue removal.
  question: How do you clean laser-contaminated quartz optics without damaging them?
  topic_keyword: quartz optics
  topic_statement: high transparency prevents damage
- answer: Contaminants such as metallic particles absorb 1064 nm laser energy far
    more than quartz, resulting in intense localized heating. This process can create
    thermal shock that exceeds the material's fracture toughness, forming micro-cracks.
    That method of precise fluence control below ~2.5 J/cm² is practical to prevent
    such damage.
  question: What happens if laser cleaning is performed on contaminated quartz glass
    surfaces?
  topic_keyword: contaminated quartz glass surfaces
  topic_statement: Thermal shock induces micro-cracks
- answer: Quartz glass exhibits high transparency at 1064 nm, requiring practical
    fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to prevent beam passage through thin sections.
    That method also demands rigorous eye protection, since laser energy transmits
    straight through the material.
  question: Does quartz glass transparency affect laser cleaning effectiveness and
    safety?
  topic_keyword: quartz glass transparency
  topic_statement: Demands precise fluence control
- answer: In a straightforward way, quartz glass delivers superior UV transmission
    and thermal shock resistance up to 1100°C, whereas sapphire brings greater hardness.
    For standard 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm², fused silica stands out as practical
    due to its lower cost and solid durability.
  question: How does quartz glass compare to other materials like sapphire for laser
    system windows?
  topic_keyword: laser system windows
  topic_statement: Superior UV transmission thermal shock
- answer: Clouding and discoloration straightforwardly signal cumulative thermal damage
    from fluence exceeding 2.5 J/cm². This process heightens scatter, which lowers
    transmission efficiency and cleaning performance. That method of incorrect 50%
    overlap also causes pitting and coating damage, undermining the optic's integrity.
  question: What are the signs of quartz optic degradation in laser cleaning systems?
  topic_keyword: quartz optic degradation
  topic_statement: Clouding, discoloration from thermal damage
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning can effectively remove coatings or deposits from quartz
    surfaces without damaging the substrate. Using controlled laser pulses, it ablates
    contaminants selectively, preserving quartz's delicate structure. In my work here
    in Indonesia, we've successfully applied this for optical components, ya, with
    excellent results.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove coatings or deposits from quartz surfaces without
    damaging the substrate?
  topic_keyword: without damaging the substrate
  topic_statement: Transmits laser preserving optics
- answer: Keep fluence under 2.5 J/cm² in a straightforward manner to avoid damaging
    the quartz substrate. Use beam dumps and complete optical enclosures practically
    to handle risky reflections and trap any flying debris. Watch for surface wear
    continuously, since slight contamination can spark local heating and lasting optic
    harm at 1064 nm.
  question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning near quartz components?
  topic_keyword: quartz components
  topic_statement: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm²
- answer: Fused silica, with superior UV transmission and low OH content (<5 ppm),
    enables efficiently 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² without thermal stress.
    Natural quartz faces higher impurity inclusions, risking localized absorption
    and micro-fractures that compromise this process integrity and may damage the
    substrate under standard laser parameters.
  question: How does quartz glass purity (fused silica vs. natural quartz) affect
    laser cleaning applications?
  topic_keyword: quartz glass purity
  topic_statement: Fused silica enables stress-free cleaning
