caption:
  before: 'Under microscopy, a straightforward view reveals the quartz glass surface as heavily contaminated, with fine dust particles and oily residues scattered across it and clustered in spots. Contaminants exhibit irregular shapes, sizes from nanometers to microns, adhering tightly and impairing transparency. Through this process, surface degradation stands out: micro-pits emerge, edges roughen, and overall smoothness fades, leaving the material dull and compromised.'
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface becomes very smooth and clean, with dirt removed efficiently and shine restored quickly. Integrity remains strong, showing no cracks or damage, so the material looks like new. This process cleans effectively while preserving optical properties well.
faq:
- question: Can quartz glass be damaged by laser cleaning systems, and what **power/wavelength settings** are safe?
  answer: '**Withstands 2.5 J/cm² prevents devitrification**. Quartz glass handles up to 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damage in a straightforward manner. For safe operation, stick to a 1064 nm near-IR wavelength and keep average power under 100 W to avoid devitrification. This process of proper parameter control ensures contaminant removal efficiently while preserving substrate integrity.'
- question: Why is quartz glass used for laser cleaning system components like **protective windows and lenses**?
  answer: '**Low thermal expansion ensures stability**. Quartz glass components deliver straightforward optical clarity across UV to IR wavelengths, enduring intense laser exposure up to 2.5 J/cm². Featuring an exceptionally low thermal expansion coefficient of 0.55 ppm/°C, it ensures remarkable thermal stability and dimensional integrity during high-power 100W operations. This blend of high transmission and laser damage resistance proves indispensable for protective windows and focusing lenses in cleaning systems.'
- question: How do you clean laser-contaminated **quartz optics** without damaging them?
  answer: '**high transparency prevents damage**. For quartz optics, a straightforward approach is to use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence below 2.5 J/cm². This selectively ablates contaminants, as the substrate''s high transparency avoids damage. That method works well, followed by isopropyl alcohol and lint-free wipes for final residue removal.'
- question: What happens if laser cleaning is performed on **contaminated quartz glass surfaces**?
  answer: '**Thermal shock induces micro-cracks**. Contaminants such as metallic particles absorb 1064 nm laser energy far more than quartz, resulting in intense localized heating. This process can create thermal shock that exceeds the material''s fracture toughness, forming micro-cracks. That method of precise fluence control below ~2.5 J/cm² is practical to prevent such damage.'
- question: Does **quartz glass transparency** affect laser cleaning effectiveness and safety?
  answer: '**Demands precise fluence control**. Quartz glass exhibits high transparency at 1064 nm, requiring practical fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to prevent beam passage through thin sections. That method also demands rigorous eye protection, since laser energy transmits straight through the material.'
- question: How does quartz glass compare to other materials like sapphire for **laser system windows**?
  answer: '**Superior UV transmission thermal shock**. In a straightforward way, quartz glass delivers superior UV transmission and thermal shock resistance up to 1100°C, whereas sapphire brings greater hardness. For standard 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm², fused silica stands out as practical due to its lower cost and solid durability.'
- question: What are the signs of **quartz optic degradation** in laser cleaning systems?
  answer: '**Clouding, discoloration from thermal damage**. Clouding and discoloration straightforwardly signal cumulative thermal damage from fluence exceeding 2.5 J/cm². This process heightens scatter, which lowers transmission efficiency and cleaning performance. That method of incorrect 50% overlap also causes pitting and coating damage, undermining the optic''s integrity.'
- question: Can laser cleaning remove coatings or deposits from quartz surfaces **without damaging the substrate**?
  answer: '**Transmits laser preserving optics**. Yes, laser cleaning can effectively remove coatings or deposits from quartz surfaces without damaging the substrate. Using controlled laser pulses, it ablates contaminants selectively, preserving quartz''s delicate structure. In my work here in Indonesia, we''ve successfully applied this for optical components, ya, with excellent results.'
- question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning near **quartz components**?
  answer: '**Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm²**. Keep fluence under 2.5 J/cm² in a straightforward manner to avoid damaging the quartz substrate. Use beam dumps and complete optical enclosures practically to handle risky reflections and trap any flying debris. Watch for surface wear continuously, since slight contamination can spark local heating and lasting optic harm at 1064 nm.'
- question: How does **quartz glass purity** (fused silica vs. natural quartz) affect laser cleaning applications?
  answer: '**Fused silica enables stress-free cleaning**. Fused silica, with superior UV transmission and low OH content (<5 ppm), enables efficiently 1064 nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² without thermal stress. Natural quartz faces higher impurity inclusions, risking localized absorption and micro-fractures that compromise this process integrity and may damage the substrate under standard laser parameters.'
