caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the contaminated MMC surface appears very-very rough and
    pitted, with contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues adhering
    tightly to the metal matrix. These cover and obscure the composite structure,
    while surface degradation shows small-small cracks and erosion spots, so weakening
    the material integrity overall.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Metal Matrix Composite surface appears
    very-very smooth and clean, with contaminants removed then polished away effectively.
    Restoration quality is high-high, so material integrity remains intact—no cracks
    or weakening occur. The composite properties stay preserved, and the surface shines
    brightly, ready for general applications like aerospace parts. This process cleans
    then restores without harm.

  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning of MMCs requires precise parameter control to prevent damage.
      Using 1064 nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence minimizes thermal stress differences
      between metal matrix and ceramic reinforcements. This prevents micro-cracks
      while effectively removing contaminants through controlled ablation with minimal
      thermal diffusion to the composite structure.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used on Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) without
      damaging the reinforcing particles or creating micro-cracks?
  - answer: For SiC-Al MMCs, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with nanosecond pulses
      around 10 ns. A fluence of 5 J/cm² effectively removes oxides while the aluminum
      matrix's high thermal conductivity dissipates energy, preventing damage to the
      SiC reinforcements. This parameter set ensures selective ablation of the contaminant
      layer.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning oxides from silicon carbide (SiC) aluminum MMCs without etching
      the surface?
  - answer: We verify cleaning efficacy using SEM/EDS to confirm contaminant removal
      while preserving the MMC's microstructure. Crucially, we employ X-ray diffraction
      to measure residual stress, ensuring our 5 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size
      don't compromise fatigue or corrosion resistance.
    question: How do you verify that laser cleaning has removed contaminants from
      an MMC surface without altering its fatigue or corrosion-resistant properties?
  - answer: Laser cleaning MMCs at 5 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous ceramic nanoparticles
      like Al₂O₃ and SiC fumes. Effective local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/ULPA
      filtration is mandatory. Operators require full PPE, including respiratory protection,
      to mitigate inhalation risks from these ultrafine toxic by-products.
    question: What safety hazards are specific to laser cleaning MMCs, such as toxic
      fume generation from vaporized ceramic or metal particles?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares MMC surfaces using a 5 J/cm² fluence
      and 50 µm spot size. This removes contaminants while generating optimal roughness
      for adhesion, with minimal thermal impact on the composite matrix compared to
      abrasive methods.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for preparing MMC surfaces for subsequent
      processes like thermal spraying or adhesive bonding?
  - answer: Discoloration arises from aluminum matrix micro-melting and rapid oxide
      reformation. To prevent this, maintain fluence below ~5 J/cm² and use a 1064
      nm wavelength. This ensures contaminant removal without thermally altering the
      composite's surface, preserving its uniform appearance.
    question: Why might laser cleaning cause discoloration or a hazy finish on an
      aluminum MMC part, and how can it be prevented?
  - answer: Untuk MMC aluminium berpelat serat karbon, gunakan fluence rendah 5 J/cm²
      dengan spot 50 µm untuk menghilangkan kontaminan. Parameter ini berada di bawah
      ambang ablasi serat karbon, mencegah kerusakan termal pada material komposit
      yang sensitif.
    question: For carbon fiber reinforced aluminum MMCs, how do you avoid damaging
      the carbon fibers during laser cleaning of surface contaminants?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence eliminates chemical disposal costs and
      abrasive media consumption. For MMCs, this non-contact approach preserves reinforcement
      integrity, reducing part rejection rates. The initial investment is rapidly
      offset in high-value aerospace components requiring precision surface preparation.
    question: What is the cost-benefit analysis of using laser cleaning for MMCs compared
      to traditional methods like chemical etching or abrasive blasting?
  - answer: Untuk komponen MMC kompleks, kami menggunakan robot 6-sumbu dengan pemindaian
      adaptif untuk menjaga fluence 5 J/cm² pada seluruh kontur. Teknologi penginderaan
      real-time menyesuaikan daya laser 100W secara dinamis, mencegah akumulasi panas
      di tepi tipis seperti pada bilah turbin dan memastikan pembersihan yang seragam
      tanpa merusak substrat.
    question: Can laser cleaning be automated for complex-shaped MMC components, like
      turbine blades with cooling channels, without creating thin-edge effects?
  - answer: Aluminium MMC's high thermal conductivity rapidly dissipates energy, necessitating
      higher peak powers around 100 W and nanosecond pulses to overcome this. This
      approach confines heat to the surface, preventing bulk substrate damage while
      effectively removing contaminants at a fluence of 5 J/cm².
    question: How does the high thermal conductivity of an aluminum MMC matrix affect
      the laser cleaning process and required energy input?
