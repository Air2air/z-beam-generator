  before: Under microscopy, PTFE surface appears very-very rough with oily contaminants
    stuck and degradation spots visible.
  after: The ultrafast laser cleaning process removes contaminants very-very effectively
    from polytetrafluoroethylene surfaces, then restores smoothness and integrity.
    The cleaned surface appears pristine and glossy, with no damage to the plastic's
    chemical structure or mechanical properties. Restoration quality is high-high,
    preserving hydrophobicity and durability for general applications, so the material
    remains fully functional and reliable.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: With PTFE's low surface energy and thermal sensitivity, we maintain 5.1
      J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed for safe contaminant removal. This prevents
      ablation or discoloration by leveraging nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength,
      which the material absorbs effectively without subsurface damage.
    question: Can laser cleaning safely remove contaminants from PTFE surfaces without
      damaging the material?
  - answer: For PTFE's unique absorption profile, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with
      5.1 J/cm² fluence. This near-infrared setting, using 50 µm spot size and 100
      W average power, provides optimal contaminant removal while preventing the thermal
      degradation common in other polymers like polyethylene.
    question: What laser wavelength and parameters are optimal for cleaning PTFE versus
      other plastics?
  - answer: Laser cleaning PTFE at 5.1 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous PFAS compounds
      and HF gas. OSHA mandates robust fume extraction with HEPA/ULPA filtration for
      nanoparticles and acid gas scrubbers to capture toxic byproducts, requiring
      negative-pressure enclosures for operator safety.
    question: Does laser cleaning PTFE create hazardous fumes or nanoparticles, and
      what extraction is required?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² significantly increases PTFE's surface energy
      by creating microstructures and removing fluorine. This enhances wettability
      for superior coating adhesion, outperforming chemical methods with precise,
      non-thermal 1064 nm processing.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface energy of PTFE for subsequent
      adhesion or coating?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² fluence effectively removes baked-on contaminants
      from PTFE. This process restores the original low surface energy, reinstating
      non-stick performance without thermal degradation when using appropriate 1064
      nm wavelength and 50% beam overlap.
    question: Can laser cleaning restore the non-stick properties of contaminated
      PTFE components?
  - answer: PTFE's porous structure presents challenges for deep contamination removal,
      as our optimal 5.1 J/cm² fluence primarily addresses surface layers. Subsurface
      contaminants often require multiple passes, which risks thermal accumulation
      and potential material modification beyond the intended treatment zone.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for PTFE with embedded contaminants
      or deep penetration?
  - answer: Laser cleaning surpasses traditional methods by preserving PTFE's integrity
      with precise 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 50 μm spot size. It eliminates chemical waste
      and abrasive media, offering a safer, non-contact solution that maintains the
      low-friction surface critical for aerospace and medical applications.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sandblasting,
      chemical cleaning) for PTFE maintenance?
  - answer: Proper cleaning preserves PTFE's white hue and smooth texture. Thermal
      damage appears as browning or yellowing at fluences exceeding ~5 J/cm², indicating
      polymer degradation. Optimal 1064 nm wavelength ablation removes contaminants
      without altering the substrate's inherent properties.
    question: What visual indicators distinguish proper laser cleaning from damage
      on PTFE surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning can sterilize medical PTFE implants when using 1064 nm
      wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² fluence. This effectively ablates contaminants while
      preserving the polymer's structural integrity. However, post-process validation
      for surface chemistry and regulatory compliance is mandatory for refurbished
      medical devices.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for medical-grade PTFE implants or devices
      during refurbishment?
  - answer: PTFE's high thermal expansion coefficient of ~135×10⁻⁶/°C necessitates
      careful thermal stress management during laser cleaning. We maintain process
      stability by using a 50 kHz repetition rate and 500 mm/s scan speed to minimize
      localized heating, which prevents the dimensional distortion and warping common
      in this polymer. This ensures uniform material removal without compromising
      the substrate's integrity.
    question: How does the high thermal expansion coefficient of PTFE affect laser
      cleaning process stability?
