name: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
slug: polytetrafluoroethylene-(ptfe)
title: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
material_description: Polytetrafluoroethylene exhibits strong chemical resistance
  and low friction. For laser cleaning, it allows precise contaminant removal without
  residue, thus preserves surface integrity in demanding fields like aerospace and
  medical devices. Thermal sensitivity poses challenges, so controlled processing
  follows to avoid deformation.
