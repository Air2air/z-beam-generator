description: '### Laser Cleaning Nickel: Key Settings and Practical Tips


  Hello, I''m Ikmanda Roswati, a materials engineer from Indonesia with years of hands-on
  work in laser processing. When it comes to cleaning Nickel surfaces, you face a
  sturdy metal that''s common in tough environments like aerospace parts or chemical
  reactors. Nickel holds up well under heat and corrosion, but its shine and heat-spreading
  ways make laser cleaning tricky. Let''s break this down so you can get clean results
  without damaging the base material.


  Nickel shines in laser cleaning because of its strong thermal shock resistance—around
  117°C range before issues pop up. This means you can hit it with quick laser pulses
  without cracking the surface, unlike brittle alloys that splinter easily. So, lean
  into short pulses to zap contaminants fast. Its zero porosity also helps; dirt and
  oxides don''t sink in deep, so a single pass often lifts them right off. Just watch
  the buildup from applications like oil and gas gear—those greasy residues come off
  cleaner than on porous metals.


  But Nickel has weaknesses that demand care. Its high reflectivity, about 65%, sends
  most laser energy bouncing away, so the beam doesn''t absorb well into the metal.
  This slows cleaning and risks uneven spots if you''re not patient. To fix this,
  start with a fluence just above the ablation threshold—aim for 2.5 J/cm²—and use
  multiple passes to build heat gradually. Don''t crank the power right away; that
  could overheat thin coatings on medical devices or electronics. Instead, lower the
  initial power to 100 W and ramp up as you see the contaminants loosen.


  What sets Nickel apart from everyday steels is its balanced strength and expansion.
  With a thermal expansion of 13.3 × 10⁻⁶ per °C, it doesn''t warp much under laser
  heat, unlike aluminum that buckles fast. This makes your approach more forgiving
  for large parts in energy storage batteries. But because of its decent thermal conductivity—90.7
  W/m·K—heat spreads quickly across the surface. You adjust by tightening the spot
  size to 50 μm; this keeps energy focused and prevents wide heat-affected zones that
  could soften nearby areas.


  An unusual trait is Nickel''s solid oxidation resistance, rated at 1.65 on a simple
  scale. In humid setups like chemical processing, this means surface oxides form
  slowly, so contaminants stick less but might need a pre-wipe to expose them fully.
  Practically, this cuts your cleaning time—run at a scan speed of 500 mm/s to cover
  big panels without lingering. Just overlap each pass by 50% to catch any stubborn
  edges; skipping this leaves streaks that corrode faster in salty oil and gas conditions.


  Pitfalls lurk if you ignore its melting point around 1455°C. Push too hard, and
  you hit thermal destruction before the grime fully burns off. Avoid this by sticking
  to 10 ns pulse widths—they deliver quick energy bursts without deep penetration.
  High repetition rates like 100 kHz work great here, pulsing often to erode layers
  without melting the Nickel underneath. I''ve seen teams skip the pass count and
  end up with pitted surfaces on aerospace components; always do at least three passes,
  checking between each for even removal.


  For settings, tailor to your machine but base it on these: power at 100 W keeps
  things safe for starters, especially on delicate medical implants. The 1064 nm wavelength
  suits Nickel well since it matches its absorption band, pulling in that 35-37% of
  energy effectively without fancy filters. If your contaminants include heavy metals
  from electronics manufacturing, drop the scan speed to 300 mm/s for the first pass
  to let the laser dwell a bit longer. And test on a scrap piece—Nickel''s compressive
  strength of 345 MPa means it resists denting, but over-fluence above 2.1 J/cm² can
  still etch the surface unnecessarily.


  In practice, combine these with your workflow. For corroded Nickel pipes in oil
  and gas, the low corrosion rate—0.005 mm per year—means you won''t strip much base
  material, but focus on removing salts to extend life. On energy storage cells, its
  electrical conductivity of 14.3 million S/m stays intact post-cleaning if you avoid
  high heat buildup. A quick tip: if reflectivity causes misses, add a thin absorbing
  layer like graphite spray first—it boosts uptake and cuts passes needed.


  Working with Nickel rewards precision over power. Tune your settings as I described,
  and you''ll clear contaminants reliably while preserving that tough, reliable surface.
  If you hit snags, like uneven absorption on polished parts, slow the speed and add
  passes—it''s straightforward once you adjust. Let''s keep those applications running
  smooth.'
