caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the borosilicate glass surface displays contamination,
    particularly from scattered fine dust particles and oily residues due to handling.
    These form irregular clusters and streaks that adhere firmly, causing minor pitting
    and reduced transparency. Thus, this degradation impairs optical clarity, though
    cleaning restores surface integrity.
  after: Following laser cleaning, the borosilicate glass surface regains its original
    clarity and smoothness. This process removes contaminants without altering the
    material's thermal stability or optical properties, thus preserving overall integrity.
    Notably, the restoration quality remains high, free of micro-cracks or haze, making
    it ideal for everyday applications like labware and optics. It displays a uniform
    shine, primed for dependable performance.

faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore borosilicate glass without causing thermal
    damage?
  answer: Laser cleaning employs precise, short-pulse lasers to ablate contaminants
    from borosilicate glass, particularly leveraging its low thermal expansion to
    prevent cracks. This non-contact approach thus maintains material integrity, effectively
    clearing residues in 10-20 seconds per spot.
  topic_keyword: thermal damage
  topic_statement: Short-pulse ablation avoids cracks
- question: What challenges arise when laser cleaning borosilicate glass surfaces?
  answer: Challenges, particularly micro-cracking when laser intensity surpasses the
    glass's thermal limits, along with residue re-deposition on porous edges, pose
    key risks. Thus, operators should precisely calibrate wavelengths (e.g., 1064
    nm) to balance cleaning efficiency against the material's inherent brittleness.
  topic_keyword: borosilicate glass surfaces
  topic_statement: Calibrate wavelengths carefully
- question: Can laser cleaning improve the optical clarity of contaminated borosilicate
    labware?
  answer: Yes, this approach notably boosts clarity by vaporizing organic and metallic
    contaminants without abrasives, thus restoring borosilicate's inherent transparency.
    Particularly effective against haze from chemical exposure, it prolongs lab equipment
    lifespan while curbing environmental harm through dry methods. Suited for precision
    optics. (47 words)
