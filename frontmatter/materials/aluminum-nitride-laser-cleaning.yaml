title: Aluminum Nitride Laser Cleaning
name: Aluminum Nitride
settings_description: When laser cleaning Aluminum Nitride, its low laser absorption
  stands out compared to more responsive ceramics like alumina. This tends to require
  higher energy pulses to effectively remove contaminants without wasting power on
  transmission through the material. I've seen success by adjusting focus to a tighter
  beam spot, which improves removal efficiency while preserving the substrate's integrity.
  Start with conservative settings to avoid thermal gradients that could induce microcracks.
  Watch for uneven heating at the end, as it risks subsurface damage in this brittle
  ceramic.
material_description: When laser cleaning Aluminum Nitride, I've seen it hold up remarkably
  well under intense heat thanks to its superior thermal stability and insulating
  qualities, so watch for any potential surface cracking from uneven exposure

  before: At 1000x magnification, the contaminated aluminum nitride surface reveals
    clusters of dark particles scattered unevenly across the field. Fine debris clings
    to edges and fills shallow crevices, creating a mottled appearance that obscures
    the underlying structure. This buildup disrupts the overall smoothness and hides
    natural grain boundaries.
  after: After laser treatment, the same surface displays a uniform, clean texture
    free from any visible residues. The process exposes clear, even facets that reflect
    light consistently throughout the view. Now the material
