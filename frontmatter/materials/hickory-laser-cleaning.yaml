    - When laser cleaning hickory, its dense hardwood structure resists thermal damage
      better than softer woods, so stick to steady scan speeds to uncover clean surfaces
      without charring the underlying fibers
  - - micro
    - before: At 1000x magnification, the hickory surface reveals dark grime clinging
        tightly to its fibers. Contaminants fill irregular pores, creating a rough
        and uneven texture overall. Dirt layers obscure the underlying wood structure
        completely.
      after: After laser treatment, the hickory surface shows a smooth and clear finish
        at 1000x. The process removes all visible grime, exposing fresh fibers beneath.
        Clean pores restore the wood's natural, even pattern fully.

  - - faq
    - - question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse
          duration) for cleaning contaminants from Hickory without **burning or yellowing**
          the surface?
        answer: '**Nanosecond 1064 nm low fluence**. Given Hickory''s pretty high
          lignin content, go with nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength and 1.2
          J/cm² fluence. This basically cuts down thermal input to avoid scorching.
          Keep average power under 100 W and scan speed at 500 mm/s for solid contaminant
          removal without yellowing the wood.'
      - question: How do you remove **smoke stains or soot** from a Hickory surface
          using a laser without causing further damage?
        answer: '**Low fluence prevents cooking**. For hickory, go with a defocused
          beam at 1.2 J/cm² and 500 mm/s scan speed. This pretty gently ablates the
          superficial soot layer, all while minimizing heat transfer to the underlying
          wood and preventing further damage. Basically, the trick is a high repetition
          rate paired with very low fluence to steer clear of cooking the compromised
          surface.'
      - question: Can a laser effectively clean old, oxidized finish or paint from
          Hickory while preserving the wood's **natural color and grain**?
        answer: '**Avoid lignin interaction for preservation**. This is basically
          a high-risk application on Hickory. The 1064 nm wavelength and 1.2 J/cm²
          fluence must ablate the finish without interacting with the wood''s lignin,
          which is fairly critical for preserving its natural color.'
      - question: Why does Hickory tend to turn dark or black when laser cleaned,
          unlike Maple or Pine?
        answer: Hickory's pretty high density and lignin levels make it prone to carbonization
          above 1.2 J/cm² energy densities. That's fairly different from less dense
          woods like pine, which hold fewer organic polymers that char readily under
          1064 nm laser irradiation.
      - question: Is laser cleaning safe for restoring antique Hickory furniture or
          tools, or does it risk **removing the patina**?
        answer: '**Ablates patina top layer**. Laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² will basically
          ablate the wood''s top layer, right where the patina resides. This subtractive
          process fundamentally alters the antique''s character, so it''s not recommended
          for valuable Hickory pieces—preserving that original surface is fairly critical.'
      - question: What are the primary fume extraction and safety concerns when laser
          cleaning Hickory, especially if it has **old finishes**?
        answer: '**Generates toxic VOCs particulates**. When laser cleaning hickory
          at 1.2 J/cm², it typically produces fine particulates and potentially toxic
          VOCs from old finishes. A Class I enclosure with HEPA and activated carbon
          filtration is basically essential for capturing these hazardous byproducts
          and protecting operators.'
      - question: How does the high density and Janka hardness of Hickory affect the
          laser cleaning process compared to softer woods?
        answer: Hickory's high density typically causes slower lateral heat diffusion,
          concentrating thermal energy at the beam's 100 µm spot. This demands fairly
          precise tuning to our 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold to avoid charring, unlike
          more forgiving softwoods.
      - question: Are there any surface pre-treatments or post-treatment steps recommended
          when laser cleaning Hickory to **prevent discoloration**?
        answer: '**Light sanding removes heat-affected layer**. For Hickory, a fairly
          light post-treatment sanding effectively strips away the superficial heat-affected
          layer that often leads to discoloration. In the process, a low-power air
          assist basically cools the surface to ease thermal stress near the 1.2 J/cm²
          fluence threshold. Typically, we skip pre-treatments to avoid surface contamination.'
      - question: For preparing Hickory for a new finish, is laser cleaning a viable
          alternative to sanding for **removing mill scale** or embedded dirt?
        answer: '**Heat-affected zone inhibits stain absorption**. Laser cleaning
          fairly effectively strips surface contaminants from Hickory without changing
          its texture, via a 100W system at 500 mm/s. That said, the heat-affected
          zone may block stain absorption, potentially causing an uneven finish. Basically,
          it won''t flatten the surface, so sanding is still needed for deep stains
          or leveling adjustments.'
