  before: Microscopy shows Hickory's surface marred by embedded dust particles, causing
    pitting and fiber erosion. This degrades cleaning in furniture production.
  after: After cleaning Hickory wood surfaces, the material exhibits a smooth, residue-free
    finish that restores its original grain and warm tones effectively. Restoration
    quality remains high, with no damage to structural integrity or natural oils.
    This method supports applications in furniture maintenance, ensuring long-lasting,
    vibrant results without surface degradation.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For Hickory's high lignin content, use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength
      with 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This minimizes thermal input, preventing scorching.
      Maintain average power below 100 W and a scan speed of 500 mm/s for effective
      contaminant removal without yellowing the wood surface.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning contaminants from Hickory without burning or yellowing the surface?
  - answer: For Hickory, use a defocused beam at 1.2 J/cm² and 500 mm/s scan speed.
      This gently ablates the superficial soot layer while minimizing heat transfer
      to the underlying wood, preventing further damage. The key is a high repetition
      rate with very low fluence to avoid cooking the compromised surface.
    question: How do you remove smoke stains or soot from a Hickory surface using
      a laser without causing further damage?
  - answer: This is a high-risk application on Hickory. The 1064 nm wavelength and
      1.2 J/cm² fluence must ablate the finish without interacting with the wood's
      lignin, which is critical for preserving its natural color.
    question: Can a laser effectively clean old, oxidized finish or paint from Hickory
      while preserving the wood's natural color and grain?
  - answer: Hickory's high density and lignin concentration make it prone to carbonization
      at energy densities above 1.2 J/cm². This differs from less dense woods like
      Pine, which contain fewer organic polymers that readily char under laser irradiation
      at 1064 nm.
    question: Why does Hickory tend to turn dark or black when laser cleaned, unlike
      Maple or Pine?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² will inherently ablate the wood's top layer
      where patina resides. This subtractive process fundamentally alters the antique's
      character and is not recommended for valuable Hickory pieces where preserving
      the original surface is critical.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for restoring antique Hickory furniture or tools,
      or does it risk removing the patina?
  - answer: Laser cleaning Hickory at 1.2 J/cm² generates fine particulates and potentially
      toxic VOCs from old finishes. A Class I enclosure with HEPA and activated carbon
      filtration is non-negotiable to capture these hazardous byproducts, ensuring
      operator safety.
    question: What are the primary fume extraction and safety concerns when laser
      cleaning Hickory, especially if it has old finishes?
  - answer: Hickory's high density causes slower lateral heat diffusion, concentrating
      thermal energy at the beam's 100 µm spot. This demands precise tuning to our
      1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold to avoid charring, unlike more forgiving softwoods.
    question: How does the high density and Janka hardness of Hickory affect the laser
      cleaning process compared to softer woods?
  - answer: For Hickory, post-treatment with a very light sanding effectively removes
      the superficial, heat-affected layer that can cause discoloration. During the
      process, using a low-power air assist helps cool the surface, mitigating thermal
      stress when operating near the 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold. Pre-treatments are
      generally avoided to prevent surface contamination.
    question: Are there any surface pre-treatments or post-treatment steps recommended
      when laser cleaning Hickory to prevent discoloration?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes surface contaminants from Hickory without
      altering its texture, using a 100W system at 500 mm/s. However, the heat-affected
      zone can inhibit stain absorption, risking an uneven finish. This method won't
      level the surface, so sanding remains necessary for deep stains or planar correction.
    question: For preparing Hickory for a new finish, is laser cleaning a viable alternative
      to sanding for removing mill scale or embedded dirt?
