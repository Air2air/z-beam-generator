title: Bismuth Laser Cleaning
name: Bismuth
settings_description: When laser cleaning Bismuth, the primary challenge arises from
  its soft nature and tendency to melt at relatively low temperatures. This softness
  reduces the material's ability to withstand direct energy exposure without deforming,
  while its low absorption rate causes most laser energy to reflect away, prolonging
  the cleaning process and risking uneven results. We've found that starting with
  reduced power levels and shorter pulse durations effectively removes surface contaminants
  like oxides without compromising the base structure. This approach minimizes heat
  buildup, which otherwise leads to melting or cracking. In our experience, monitoring
  beam focus closely throughout multiple passes restores the surface integrity reliably.
  Be cautious with dwell times, as prolonged exposure can still cause unintended fusion
  even at conservative settings.
