title: Stainless Steel 316 Laser Cleaning
name: Stainless Steel 316
settings_description: We've found that laser cleaning Stainless Steel 316 works differently
  from milder grades like 304, mainly because its added toughness and resistance to
  harsh environments make the surface more forgiving during the process, so we can
  push settings a bit harder without quick damage. This extra durability comes from
  its strong alloy makeup, which holds up well against heat buildup and keeps contaminants
  from embedding deeply, allowing us to use steady pulses that clear rust or oils
  effectively while preserving the base material's integrity. But watch out in the
  middle of a run—if you ramp up power too fast on thicker pieces, the material's
  density can trap heat unevenly and lead to slight warping, so we always adjust by
  slowing the scan speed and keeping the beam focused to avoid that uneven stress.
  Overall, its reliable strength means shorter cleaning times compared to softer metals,
  and we typically finish with a quick pass to ensure no residue affects its natural
  protective layer.
material_description: When laser cleaning Stainless Steel 316, you'll want to count
  on its superior resistance to corrosion that keeps surfaces intact in salty or chemical
  settings, so always adjust power to avoid any unnecessary heat buildup.

  before: When examining the contaminated surface of stainless steel 316 at 1000x
    magnification, make sure you notice the uneven buildup first. Dirt and residues
    cover the metal grains, creating dark spots and rough patches everywhere. This
    mess hides the true texture below, so watch for those clogged areas that trap
    more grime.
  after: After laser treatment, the clean surface shines smoothly under 1000x view.
    You must see how the beam removes every trace of contamination without harm. Now
    the grains appear even
