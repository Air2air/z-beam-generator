caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the calcite surface displays a straightforward roughness
    and heavy contamination, featuring fine dust particles scattered and firmly attached.
    Contaminants—primarily organic residues and mineral specks—range from 1-10 micrometers,
    gathering in pits to create uneven layers. Degradation appears as micro-etching
    and minor cracks, leaving the stone dull and fragile, which requires careful cleaning
    efficiently for restored smoothness.
  after: This process cleans the calcite surface efficiently, leaving it smooth and
    restored. Material integrity remains fully intact.

faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning effectively remove contaminants from calcite surfaces
    without damaging the stone?
  answer: In laser cleaning, this process applies short, controlled pulses of light
    to vaporize dirt, soot, or pollutants on calcite surfaces. It targets only the
    top layers practically, given the material's low absorption at key wavelengths,
    while preserving the underlying structure.
  topic_keyword: without damaging the stone
  topic_statement: Low absorption preserves structure
- question: What are the benefits of using laser technology for restoring calcite-based
    artifacts?
  answer: This process delivers a practical, non-abrasive restoration for calcite,
    showcasing its natural beauty and optical clarity. It efficiently minimizes crack
    risks from mechanical methods while remaining environmentally friendly by skipping
    chemicals.

  topic_statement: Highlights optical clarity, prevents cracks
- question: Can laser cleaning address the common problem of acid-induced degradation
    on calcite marble?
  answer: Yes, but with some limitations. Lasers offer a practical way to safely remove
    surface corrosion from acid exposure, avoiding further dissolution. For severe
    internal damage, though, complementary treatments are needed to stabilize the
    calcite's reactivity and halt ongoing erosion in acidic conditions. This process
    works efficiently for preventive maintenance on sculptures and buildings.
