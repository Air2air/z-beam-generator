caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the calcite surface appears very-very rough and contaminated, with fine dust particles scattered
    and adhered tightly. Contaminants, mostly organic residues and mineral specks, measure 1-10 micrometers, clustering in
    pits and causing uneven coverage. Surface degradation shows micro-etching and small cracks, so the stone looks dull and
    weakened, needing careful cleaning to restore smoothness.
  after: Calcite surface is cleaned very-very effectively by laser process, appearing smooth and restored. Material integrity
    remains fully intact.

  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes calcite scale using 1064 nm wavelength and ~2.5 J/cm² fluence, which the mineral
      readily absorbs. This process preserves underlying metals like steel or aluminum by operating below their ablation thresholds.
      It offers a precise, chemical-free alternative to traditional descaling methods.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove calcite scale from industrial equipment without damaging the underlying
      metal?
  - answer: For calcite, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent surface damage. A 50 kHz repetition
      rate and 500 mm/s scan speed effectively remove deposits while preserving the original patina. These parameters ensure
      controlled ablation of contaminants without affecting the underlying stone structure.
    question: What laser wavelength and parameters work best for cleaning calcite deposits from marble and limestone sculptures?
  - answer: Thermal decomposition occurs above 2.5 J/cm², converting CaCO₃ to CaO. Using ultrashort pulses below 12 ns prevents
      this by minimizing heat diffusion. Real-time LIBS monitoring detects calcium oxide formation, allowing immediate parameter
      adjustment.
    question: Does laser cleaning cause thermal decomposition of calcite into calcium oxide, and how can this be prevented?
  - answer: Crystal orientation significantly alters calcite's absorption at 1064 nm, requiring fluence adjustments from the
      baseline 2.5 J/cm². For heterogeneous specimens, I recommend a lower 45 W power and rapid 500 mm/s scanning to prevent
      differential etching across grain boundaries.
    question: How do different calcite crystal sizes and orientations affect laser cleaning efficiency on geological specimens?
  - answer: When cleaning calcite at 1064 nm with 2.5 J/cm² fluence, nanoparticle release necessitates robust respiratory
      protection. Use a P100 filter and implement local exhaust ventilation to contain the generated calcium carbonate and
      contaminant aerosols, ensuring operator safety.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning calcite due to potential nanoparticle release?
  - answer: Yes, selective removal is achievable by exploiting differential absorption at 1064 nm. Optimal parameters around
      2.5 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed effectively ablate biological growth while preserving the calcite substrate,
      verified through spectroscopic analysis.
    question: Can laser cleaning selectively remove biological growth from calcite surfaces without etching the mineral itself?
  - answer: White residue typically results from calcite decomposition into calcium oxide at excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm².
      To prevent this, optimize scanning speed near 500 mm/s and use minimal passes to avoid thermal degradation of the surface.
    question: Why does calcite sometimes develop a white residue after laser cleaning, and how is this avoided?
  - answer: Laser cleaning achieves superior economic viability for large-scale calcite processing. With a 45 W average power
      and 500 mm/s scan speed, its throughput surpasses mechanical methods while eliminating recurring chemical costs and
      abrasive waste disposal, significantly reducing operational expenditure.
    question: What is the economic feasibility of using laser cleaning for large-scale calcite removal compared to traditional
      methods?
  - answer: Iron oxide's strong 1064 nm absorption requires careful fluence control below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent preferential
      removal that could etch the calcite. I recommend reducing power to 45 W and adjusting scan speed to manage this differential
      absorption, preventing subsurface damage to the mineral matrix.
    question: How does the presence of iron oxide staining within calcite affect laser cleaning parameters and outcomes?
  - answer: Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) verifies complete decontamination by detecting elemental traces below
      2.5 J/cm², the ablation threshold for Calcite. Raman spectroscopy then confirms no structural phase change, ensuring
      the 1064 nm wavelength cleaning preserved the crystal lattice. These non-destructive methods provide definitive quality
      control.
    question: What diagnostic methods are used to verify complete calcite contamination removal without surface damage?
