# SECTION 8: FAQs (Voice-Enhanced)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
faq:
- question: "Why is granite better than marble for outdoor monuments?"
  answer: "Granite basically outperforms marble outdoors due to its superior hardness (Mohs 6.5 vs 3.5) and pretty minimal acid reactivity. While marble looks elegant, it's fairly vulnerable to acid rain that causes surface pitting. For laser cleaning, granite typically handles higher fluences (2.5 J/cm² vs 2.0 J/cm²), making restoration more efficient over the stone's longer lifespan."
  topic_keyword: "better than marble"
  topic_statement: "Hardness and acid resistance"
  
- question: "Can I use the same laser settings for granite and limestone?"
  answer: "No, that's pretty risky—limestone basically requires 40% less power (60W vs 100W) and lower fluence (1.5 J/cm² vs 2.5 J/cm²) compared to granite. Limestone's much higher porosity (4% vs 0.6%) and lower compressive strength (90 MPa vs 211 MPa) mean it's fairly easy to damage with granite parameters. Our systematic approach is to always measure hardness and porosity first."
  topic_keyword: "same laser settings"
  topic_statement: "Material properties require different parameters"
  
- question: "Why is sandstone so difficult to laser clean compared to granite?"
  answer: "Sandstone's basically a nightmare due to its extreme porosity (12% vs granite's 0.6%)—that's pretty much 20 times more porous. Contaminants penetrate deeply into the grain structure, so you're looking at fairly long cleaning times with very gentle parameters (1.2 J/cm² vs 2.5 J/cm²). The weak cementation between grains means aggressive laser cleaning typically causes grain ejection, not just contamination removal."
  topic_keyword: "difficult to laser clean"
  topic_statement: "High porosity and weak structure"
  
- question: "How does granite compare to steel for laser cleaning applications?"
  answer: "They're pretty much opposite ends of the spectrum—steel has 2.9x higher density (7850 kg/m³ vs 2700 kg/m³) and 18x higher thermal conductivity (50 W/m·K vs 2.79 W/m·K). Steel basically dissipates heat super fast, so it can typically handle much higher fluence (5.0 J/cm² vs 2.5 J/cm²). But granite's lower reflectivity (0.9 vs steel's metallic reflection) makes it fairly easier to predict laser absorption patterns."
  topic_keyword: "compare to steel"
  topic_statement: "Different thermal dynamics"
  
- question: "Is concrete a good alternative to granite for outdoor installations requiring laser cleaning?"
  answer: "Not really—concrete's basically way less durable with 10x higher porosity (10% vs 0.6%) and much lower compressive strength (40 MPa vs 211 MPa). While it's pretty economical initially, the composite structure is fairly vulnerable to laser damage above 1.8 J/cm². For outdoor monuments needing periodic laser restoration, granite typically delivers better long-term value despite the higher upfront cost."
  topic_keyword: "good alternative"
  topic_statement: "Lower durability and laser sensitivity"
  
- question: "Why does black granite (basalt) need different laser settings than light granite?"
  answer: "Black granite basically absorbs 55% more laser energy (0.65 vs 0.42 absorption) due to its darker color from mafic minerals. While it's pretty tough with higher compressive strength (300 MPa vs 211 MPa), the increased absorption means we typically reduce power by 10% (90W vs 100W) to prevent localized overheating. The lower thermal conductivity (1.7 W/m·K vs 2.79 W/m·K) makes heat management fairly critical."
  topic_keyword: "different laser settings"
  topic_statement: "Higher absorption requires power reduction"
