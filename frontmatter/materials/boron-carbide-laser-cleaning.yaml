title: Boron Carbide Laser Cleaning
name: Boron Carbide
settings_description: We've found that when laser cleaning boron carbide, you must
  start slow to avoid cracking its brittle structure right from the setup. This material's
  extreme hardness makes it tough on contaminants, but that same brittleness demands
  careful control—push too hard, and micro-fractures appear under heat stress. In
  our experience, pulsing the laser at moderate rates works best, as it clears surface
  buildup without overwhelming the low absorption that keeps energy from penetrating
  deeply. We typically adjust the beam focus tight to target only the top layer, preserving
  the smooth, non-porous finish underneath. Its heat resistance shines here, letting
  you work longer sessions than with softer ceramics, but always watch for thermal
  gradients that could warp edges. Skip high continuous power; it risks uneven heating
  and material loss. Instead, test on a small area first—this brings back the original
  durability without compromising strength.
material_description: We've found boron carbide excels in laser cleaning scenarios
  thanks to its unmatched hardness that shrugs off abrasion and heat without cracking
  or deforming, setting it apart from softer ceramics by preserving structural integrity
  for armor and tooling uses in harsh environments

  before: At 1000x magnification, the boron carbide surface looks rough and dotted
    with dark specks of contamination. Grimy layers cover the peaks and valleys, making
    the texture uneven and patchy. Scattered debris clings tightly, blocking any clear
    view of the base material.
  after: After laser treatment at 1000x magnification, the boron carbide surface appears
    smooth and uniformly bright. The clean texture reveals sharp edges without lingering
    spots or roughness. We've restored the material's natural clarity, free from all
