title: Acrylic (PMMA) Laser Cleaning
name: Acrylic (PMMA)
faq:
- question: How can I prevent warping when laser cleaning acrylic sheets?
  answer: When laser cleaning acrylic, you'll want to start with low-power settings
    to avoid overheating its heat-sensitive surface. I've seen that this material
    contrasts with metals by deforming easily under brief heat exposure, so short
    pulses remove dirt without causing warps. This approach restores clarity and shape
    effectively in practical applications like signage restoration.
- question: What's the best way to remove stains from PMMA without scratching?
  answer: If you're cleaning PMMA, watch for its smooth surface that resists scratches
    but absorbs laser energy quickly. Unlike rougher plastics, acrylic cleans best
    with gentle, focused beams that lift stains layer by layer. In my experience,
    this method exposes a pristine finish and improves durability for repeated use
    in displays.
- question: Does laser cleaning affect the transparency of acrylic parts?
  answer: Laser cleaning acrylic demands careful control since its clear nature can
    fog from uneven heating. Compared to opaque thermoplastics, PMMA reveals contaminants
    easily but risks haze if pulses are too intense.

  before: The acrylic surface teems with embedded dirt particles and smudges at 1000x
    magnification. These contaminants form irregular clusters that obscure the underlying
    material completely. Scratches and residues create a bumpy, uneven texture across
    the entire area.
  after: Laser treatment clears away all traces of dirt and debris from the acrylic
    effectively. The surface now displays a smooth, uniform finish without any visible
    flaws. It exposes a clear, pristine layer that reflects light evenly throughout.
