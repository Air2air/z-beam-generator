caption:
  before: Under microscopic examination, the polystyrene surface reveals a mottled condition, scarred by fine particulate contaminants like dust and oily residues. These clusters induce micro-pitting and subtle cracking, eroding the material's inherent smoothness.
  after: After laser cleaning, the polystyrene surface regains its smooth, residue-free condition. This restoration preserves full material integrity, with no degradation to its plastic properties. Quality matches the original, perfect for general applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Polystyrene's 240°C melting point demands precise laser control. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 25 W average power and a 100 ns pulse width effectively removes contaminants while minimizing heat accumulation. The key is maintaining a fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to avoid thermal damage to the substrate.
    question: Can you safely laser clean polystyrene surfaces without melting or damaging the material?
  - answer: For polystyrene cleaning, near-IR wavelengths around 1064 nm are optimal. This provides sufficient absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal penetration into the substrate. Use a fluence of approximately 2.5 J/cm² and a 100 µm spot size to effectively clean the surface without causing polymer degradation.
    question: What laser wavelength is most suitable for cleaning polystyrene without causing degradation?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning polystyrene at 2.5 J/cm² fluence can release hazardous styrene monomers. The thermal decomposition requires robust fume extraction. Using a 100 µm spot size with 500 mm/s scan speed helps minimize localized heating and fume generation.
    question: Does laser cleaning polystyrene release styrene monomers or other hazardous fumes?
  - answer: For polystyrene cleaning, maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² using nanosecond pulses at 20 kHz. A 100 µm spot scanned at 500 mm/s effectively removes contaminants while preventing substrate melting through controlled thermal input.
    question: What laser parameters (power, pulse duration, repetition rate) work best for removing contaminants from polystyrene?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares polystyrene surfaces using 1064nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm². This process removes contaminants and increases surface energy for superior bonding and painting, outperforming traditional solvent-based methods with greater precision and no chemical residue.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare polystyrene surfaces for bonding or painting?
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed preserves optical clarity. This carefully controlled process removes contaminants without inducing surface hazing or micro-roughness, maintaining the material's original light transmission properties.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface roughness and optical properties of transparent polystyrene?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes silicone-based mold releases from polystyrene using 1064nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm². This fluence level ablates the contaminant layer without thermally degrading the underlying polymer substrate, ensuring optimal surface quality.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing mold release agents from polystyrene components?
  - answer: Polystyrene's low ignition threshold demands strict fluence control below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent combustion. Its decomposition releases highly toxic styrene monomer, requiring robust fume extraction and air-purifying respirators, unlike many engineering plastics.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning polystyrene versus other plastics?
  - answer: Polystyrene's inherent triboelectric properties make it susceptible to static charge generation. Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² can induce surface charges, potentially attracting airborne contaminants post-process. Proper parameter optimization is essential to mitigate this electrostatic effect and prevent subsequent dust attraction on the cleaned surface.
    question: Can laser cleaning create electrostatic issues on polystyrene surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning eliminates solvent-induced stress cracking risks entirely, a critical advantage for delicate polystyrene components. Using precisely controlled 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it removes contaminants while preserving dimensional stability. This dry process also avoids the environmental and safety concerns associated with chemical residues.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to solvent cleaning for delicate polystyrene parts?
