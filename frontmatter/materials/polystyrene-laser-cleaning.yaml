    - Polystyrene, this lightweight thermoplastic, manifests low thermal stability.
      Laser cleaning yields contaminant removal with minimal ablation, yet melting
      risks persist. Benefits lie in delicate applications like cultural heritage,
      where precision preserves integrity.

    - before: We've found the contaminated polystyrene surface at 1000x magnification
        shows a rough, speckled layer of grime. Fine particles and residues cling
        to every bump and crevice. This uneven coating hides the material's natural
        texture completely.
      after: After laser treatment, we see a smooth, even surface emerge clearly.
        The clean polystyrene gleams with a uniform finish. No traces of debris remain,
        restoring its original look. Watch for any slight discoloration in future
        runs.

  - - faq
    - - question: Can you safely laser clean polystyrene surfaces **without melting
          or damaging** the material?
        answer: '**Fluence below 2.5 J/cm²**. Polystyrene''s 240°C melting point requires
          essential precision in laser control. Employing a 1064 nm wavelength at
          25 W average power with 100 ns pulse width notably removes contaminants
          while curbing heat buildup. Crucially, fluence must stay below 2.5 J/cm²
          to prevent substrate thermal damage.'
      - question: What laser wavelength is most suitable for cleaning polystyrene
          **without causing degradation**?
        answer: '**1064 nm minimizes thermal penetration**. For cleaning polystyrene,
          near-IR wavelengths around 1064 nm stand out as optimal. They deliver essential
          absorption to remove contaminants while limiting thermal penetration into
          the substrate. Apply a fluence of about 2.5 J/cm² with a 100 µm spot size
          for effective surface cleaning without polymer degradation.'
      - question: Does laser cleaning polystyrene release **styrene monomers** or
          other hazardous fumes?
        answer: '**Releases hazardous styrene monomers**. Yes, laser cleaning of polystyrene
          at 2.5 J/cm² fluence can notably release hazardous styrene monomers. Thermal
          decomposition demands essential robust fume extraction. A 100 µm spot size
          paired with 500 mm/s scan speed distinctly reduces localized heating and
          fume generation.'
      - question: What laser parameters (power, pulse duration, repetition rate) work
          best for **removing contaminants from polystyrene**?
        answer: '**Low fluence prevents melting**. For cleaning polystyrene, it''s
          essential to keep fluence under 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses at 20 kHz.
          Scanning a 100 µm spot at 500 mm/s notably removes contaminants while avoiding
          substrate melting through precise thermal control.'
      - question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare polystyrene surfaces **for
          bonding or painting**?
        answer: '**Increases surface energy**. Laser cleaning offers notable preparation
          for polystyrene surfaces via a 1064nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm². This essential
          technique eliminates contaminants, elevates surface energy for enhanced
          bonding and painting, and surpasses solvent-based alternatives through superior
          precision without residues.'
      - question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface roughness and **optical
          properties** of transparent polystyrene?
        answer: '**Preserves optical clarity**. Achieving optical clarity through
          laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed proves essential.
          This precise technique removes contaminants without causing surface hazing
          or micro-roughness, notably upholding the material''s inherent light transmission
          qualities.'
      - question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing **mold release agents**
          from polystyrene components?
        answer: '**Ablates without thermal degradation**. In laser cleaning, it''s
          notable how effectively a 1064nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² removes silicone-based
          mold releases from polystyrene. This fluence level ablates the contaminant
          layer without thermally degrading the underlying polymer substrate, ensuring
          optimal surface quality.'
      - question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning polystyrene
          versus other plastics?
        answer: Polystyrene shows a notably low ignition threshold, calling for strict
          fluence control below 2.5 J/cm² to avert combustion. Decomposition releases
          highly toxic styrene monomer, so essential fume extraction and air-purifying
          respirators are vital—distinct from most engineering plastics.
      - question: Can laser cleaning create **electrostatic issues** on polystyrene
          surfaces?
        answer: '**Mitigates triboelectric charge generation**. Polystyrene exhibits
          notable triboelectric traits, leaving it prone to static charge buildup.
          Applying laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² risks creating surface charges that
          draw airborne particles afterward. Optimizing parameters remains essential
          for countering this electrostatic issue and avoiding dust buildup on the
          treated surface.'
      - question: How does laser cleaning compare to solvent cleaning for **delicate
          polystyrene parts**?
        answer: '**Eliminates solvent-induced stress cracking**. Laser cleaning entirely
          eliminates solvent-induced stress cracking risks, an essential advantage
          for delicate polystyrene components. Employing a precisely controlled 1064
          nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it removes contaminants while upholding
          dimensional stability. This dry process notably sidesteps the environmental
          and safety issues tied to chemical residues.'
