caption:
  before: Under microscopic examination, the mortar surface reveals a heavily contaminated
    condition, with irregular pores clogged by fine particulate matter—likely dust,
    organic residues, and efflorescent salts. These contaminants, unevenly distributed,
    exhibit crystalline structures and amorphous aggregates, accelerating degradation
    through micro-cracks and pitting. This erosion, it weakens the masonry integrity
    over time.
  after: After laser cleaning, the mortar surface gleams smooth and restored, with
    pristine condition and full material integrity intact. Restoration quality excels,
    preserving original strength.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes mortar residue while preserving
      brick integrity. Using 1064 nm wavelength at 12.7 J/cm² fluence ensures selective
      ablation of the mortar. Optimal parameters like 500 mm/s scan speed and 50%
      overlap prevent thermal damage to the underlying masonry, making it ideal for
      sensitive restoration work.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove mortar residue from brickwork
      without damaging the bricks?
  - answer: For historical mortar on delicate stone, use low fluence around 12.7 J/cm²
      with nanosecond pulses at 10 ns. This provides controlled ablation, preserving
      the substrate. A 1064 nm wavelength and 50% beam overlap ensure uniform removal
      of traditional lime-based compositions without thermal damage.
    question: What laser parameters work best for cleaning historical mortar from
      delicate stone surfaces?
  - answer: Laser ablation at 12.7 J/cm² significantly reduces hazardous silica dust
      compared to mechanical grinding. However, the process still generates fine particulate,
      requiring local exhaust ventilation and respiratory protection to meet OSHA's
      permissible exposure limits for crystalline silica.
    question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when removing mortar containing
      silica?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² selectively ablates contaminants without
      chemical reactions, preserving the mortar's original composition. This prevents
      damaging salt crystallization and avoids pH shifts, ensuring superior long-term
      stability compared to chemical methods which can leave reactive residues.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the chemical composition of mortar surfaces
      compared to chemical cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can differentiate materials through selective ablation.
      At 12.7 J/cm², original mortar and modern repairs, with their distinct compositions,
      ablate at different rates. This allows precise removal of later cementitious
      additions while preserving the authentic, historical substrate.
    question: Can laser cleaning distinguish between original mortar and later repairs
      during restoration projects?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes mortar layers up to 2-3 mm thick per
      pass at 12.7 J/cm². For thicker residues, a multi-pass strategy is essential
      to avoid substrate damage, often requiring mechanical pre-cleaning for deposits
      exceeding 5 mm.
    question: What's the maximum thickness of mortar residue that laser cleaning can
      effectively remove?
  - answer: Lime mortar's higher absorption at 1064 nm allows gentler cleaning near
      12.7 J/cm². Denser Portland cement requires higher fluence, risking discoloration
      if its different mineralogy isn't accommodated with adjusted power and scan
      speed.
    question: How does mortar composition (lime-based vs. Portland cement) affect
      laser cleaning results?
  - answer: For large masonry facades, laser cleaning becomes cost-effective at scale
      despite higher initial equipment costs. Our 100W systems achieve 500 mm/s scan
      speeds with 12.7 J/cm² fluence, significantly reducing labor and eliminating
      abrasive disposal compared to traditional methods.
    question: Is laser cleaning cost-effective for large-scale mortar removal from
      masonry facades?
  - answer: In confined spaces like chimneys, implement aggressive fume extraction
      to manage hazardous mortar dust. The 1064 nm wavelength poses significant reflection
      risks, requiring careful beam positioning. Continuously monitor oxygen levels
      and combustible gases to prevent atmospheric hazards.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning mortar from confined
      spaces like chimneys or tunnels?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² effectively strips contaminants and micro-roughens
      the mortar surface, creating an ideal adhesion profile for repointing. This
      method surpasses mechanical abrasion by preserving the substrate's integrity,
      ensuring superior bond strength for the new mortar without inducing micro-fractures.
    question: Can laser cleaning prepare mortar surfaces for repointing by creating
      better adhesion profiles?
  - answer: Moisture significantly increases steam generation risks during laser cleaning
      of mortar. For damp historical structures, I recommend reducing the fluence
      from 12.7 J/cm² and increasing the scan speed above 500 mm/s to manage thermal
      input. This adjustment helps prevent micro-fracturing while maintaining effective
      ablation on wet surfaces.
    question: How does moisture content in mortar affect laser cleaning efficiency
      and safety?
