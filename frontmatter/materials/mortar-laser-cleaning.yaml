title: Mortar Laser Cleaning
subtitle: Precision Laser Cleaning Notably Restores Mortar's Essential Porous Texture,
  Preserving Binders

description: 'When laser cleaning mortar, watch out for its brittle nature right from
  the start—I''ve seen it crack easily under sudden heat, unlike tougher stone in
  masonry walls. That low toughness means thermal shock hits hard, so you need to
  ease in gently to avoid spalling the surface. Tends to absorb laser energy well
  compared to slick metals, which helps clear grime without much residue, but its
  porosity traps moisture that can steam up and weaken bonds during the process.


  Start with lower power settings to build heat slowly, giving the material time to
  dissipate without fracturing. This works best when you overlap passes moderately,
  pulling away layers of dirt or salt buildup from historical facades or bridge joints.
  I''ve found scanning at a steady speed prevents hot spots that might etch the underlying
  cement-sand mix. Adjust for damp conditions by drying the area first—mortar holds
  water longer than dense brick, leading to uneven cleaning if ignored. In my experience
  on restoration sites, this approach brings back the original texture safely, especially
  for cultural heritage pieces where precision matters.'
