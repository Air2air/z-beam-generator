caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the zinc surface reveals contamination with clustered
    dark particles and hazy films. These contaminants, likely oxides and processing
    residues, adhere unevenly and promote pitting, degrading the metal's integrity
    for automotive and die casting uses.
  after: After laser cleaning, the zinc surface appears smooth and uniform, free from
    oxides, dirt, and residues that often build up in automotive or construction parts.
    This treatment restores the metal's natural shine and texture without pitting
    or discoloration. The restoration quality is high, and it maintains zinc's integrity—its
    ductility and corrosion resistance stay intact for reliable die casting applications.
    Overall, the process ensures a clean, ready-to-use surface.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning works well on galvanized steel to strip away surface
      oxides without stripping the zinc layer. Tune to 5.1 J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm
      wavelength with 10 ns pulses, keeping scans at 500 mm/s for precise control.
      Automotive industry reports show it preserves galvanization's rust barrier effectively.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used on galvanized steel without removing the
      zinc coating?
  - answer: Laser cleaning zinc surfaces at 5.1 J/cm² fluence can generate zinc oxide
      fumes, which are toxic and may cause metal fume fever or respiratory issues
      if inhaled. Exposure limits stand at 5 mg/m³ per safety standards, so use robust
      local exhaust ventilation during 100 W operations to minimize health risks and
      ensure worker safety.
    question: What are the risks of zinc oxide fume generation during laser cleaning
      of zinc surfaces?
  - answer: For effective zinc oxide removal without substrate damage, select a 1064
      nm wavelength for strong absorption and low reflectivity on zinc surfaces. Employ
      10 ns pulses at 5.1 J/cm² energy density to ablate the layer precisely, maintaining
      thermal balance during the process.
    question: How do I set laser parameters for effective cleaning of zinc oxide layers
      without damaging the underlying metal?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes contaminants from zinc-coated
      roofs while preserving their corrosion resistance. With a 1064 nm wavelength
      and 5.1 J/cm² fluence, it ablates oxides without substrate melting, as shared
      in hardware manufacturing forums for galvanizing restoration.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for removing contaminants from zinc-coated
      roofs or structures?
  - answer: When laser cleaning zinc alloys at 5.1 J/cm² fluence, vaporization generates
      hazardous zinc oxide fumes. Prioritize NIOSH-approved respirators with P100
      cartridges for inhalation risks, alongside laser-specific eye protection. Adhere
      to OSHA standards for safe exposure limits under 5 mg/m³.
    question: What PPE is required when laser cleaning zinc alloys due to potential
      vaporization?
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning on zinc avoids discoloration or oxidation when using
      a 5.1 J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm wavelength, which ablates surface oxides precisely
      without substrate melting. Keeping power at 100 W and scan speed to 500 mm/s
      ensures uniform treatment and preserves the metal's natural finish.
    question: Does laser cleaning cause discoloration or oxidation on zinc surfaces
      after treatment?
  - answer: Zinc melts at 419.5°C, a low threshold that demands careful energy control
      in laser cleaning to ablate surface oxides without substrate fusion. Using 5.1
      J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm wavelength prevents thermal damage, enabling uniform
      treatment for automotive and die-casting parts via nanosecond pulses.
    question: What is the melting point of zinc and how does it affect laser cleaning
      processes?
  - answer: For zinc cleaning, the 1064 nm near-infrared wavelength excels due to
      strong absorption in its spectrum, reducing reflectivity and heat accumulation
      compared to shorter wavelengths. Pair it with a 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 100 W
      power for precise oxide ablation while preserving the metal surface.
    question: Are there specific laser wavelengths that work best for cleaning zinc
      without excessive heat buildup?
  - answer: Zinc's high reactivity heightens corrosion risks with chemical cleaners,
      especially in galvanizing or automotive uses, where acids could etch the substrate.
      Laser methods sidestep this by ablating oxides at a safe 5.1 J/cm² fluence with
      1064 nm wavelength, delivering precise, non-contact cleaning that's environmentally
      friendlier, as industry forums emphasize.
    question: How does zinc's reactivity influence the choice of laser cleaning over
      chemical methods?
