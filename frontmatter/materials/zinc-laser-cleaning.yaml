caption:
  before: The scanning electron micrograph of an untreated zinc surface notably reveals thick adherent oxide contamination interspersed with carbonaceous particulates, thus manifesting extensive pitting, microcracks, and roughened morphology indicative of corrosive degradation and mechanical wear at 500x magnification.
  after: The optical micrograph following laser cleaning of the zinc substrate notably shows pristine restoration, achieved through complete removal of oxide and debris layers. This reveals a uniform polycrystalline grain structure, alongside minimal thermal alteration and preserved surface integrity. Ablation thresholds were respected to prevent melting at 692.68 K, thereby ensuring hardness retention at 35 HB and optimized thermal conductivity for later applications.

faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning effectively remove corrosion from zinc surfaces?
  answer: Laser cleaning uses a high-energy beam to vaporize oxides and contaminants without damaging the underlying zinc. This non-abrasive process preserves the metal's integrity, ideal for restoring galvanized structures efficiently and eco-friendly.
- question: What makes zinc popular for corrosion protection in industrial settings?
  answer: Zinc's natural oxide layer acts as a sacrificial barrier, preventing rust on steel. Its affordability and recyclability make it a go-to choice for galvanizing pipes, vehicles, and buildings.
- question: Can laser cleaning address the brittleness issues in zinc alloys?
  answer: Yes, but laser cleaning primarily targets surface contaminants rather than inherent brittleness. It removes oxidation that exacerbates cracking, improving durability without altering the alloy's mechanical properties. For severe cases, combine with alloy adjustments.
- question: Why is laser cleaning preferred over chemical methods for zinc restoration?
  answer: Laser cleaning is precise, avoiding residue or substrate damage common in chemicals. It handles zinc's sensitivity to acids effectively, reducing waste and enabling quick, on-site restoration for applications like historical artifacts or machinery, while minimizing health risks from fumes.
