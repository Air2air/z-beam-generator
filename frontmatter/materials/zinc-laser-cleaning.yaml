description: '### Laser Cleaning Zinc: Key Settings and Practical Tips


  Hello, I''m Ikmanda Roswati, a materials engineer from Indonesia with a Ph.D. in
  metallurgy. I''ve worked on plenty of metal surfaces in industrial settings, like
  automotive parts and galvanized steel. Today, I want to walk you through laser cleaning
  zinc—it''s a common material in things like hardware and construction, but it needs
  careful handling to get the job done right. Zinc cleans up well with lasers because
  it doesn''t hold onto contaminants tightly, but its low melting point and shiny
  surface can trip you up if you''re not watching. Let''s break this down so you can
  set up your machine and avoid common mistakes.


  First off, zinc''s biggest strength in laser cleaning is its solid thermal conductivity—around
  116 W/m·K. That means heat spreads out quickly across the surface, which helps prevent
  hot spots that could damage the metal underneath. So, when you''re blasting away
  rust or paint, the energy doesn''t build up in one place. You can push scan speeds
  up to 500 mm/s without worrying too much about warping, as long as you keep passes
  to about three. This makes zinc faster to clean compared to something like aluminum,
  where heat lingers longer. Just overlap your laser paths by 50% to ensure even coverage,
  and you''ll remove buildup like old galvanizing layers without leaving patches.


  But here''s the flip side: zinc reflects a ton of laser light, with reflectivity
  hitting about 95% in the near-infrared range we usually use for cleaning. That low
  absorption—only around 5% of the energy sticks—means you waste a lot of power if
  you crank it too high right away. It makes zinc different from darker metals like
  steel, which soak up more heat and clean easier. With zinc, the laser bounces off
  more, so your process feels less efficient at first. To fix this, start with lower
  power settings, say 100 W, and build up. Use a pulse width of 10 ns and a repetition
  rate around 50 kHz to deliver short, controlled bursts. This way, you ablate contaminants
  without the metal itself getting too hot. If you''re cleaning galvanized zinc, watch
  for the zinc coating melting before the dirt does—adjust energy density to 5.1 J/cm²
  max to stay under the ablation threshold of about 1.15 J/cm² for the base metal.


  One unusual thing about zinc is its low melting point, just 419°C. That''s way lower
  than iron''s 1538°C, so it acts more like a soft alloy in heat-sensitive jobs. In
  practice, this means laser cleaning zinc shines in applications like die casting
  or hardware manufacturing, where you want to strip oxides without deforming the
  part. But it also raises the risk of vaporizing the surface if you go too fast.
  I''ve seen teams melt thin zinc layers on car bumpers because they didn''t account
  for this. The fix? Keep your spot size small, around 50 μm, to focus the beam precisely.
  And always test on a scrap piece—zinc''s thermal expansion is high at 30.2 × 10^-6
  per K, so uneven heating can cause buckling. Cool the workpiece with air between
  passes if it''s a big area, and that keeps things stable.


  Zinc also has great corrosion resistance, losing only 0.003 mm per year in humid
  spots, which is why it''s popular for galvanizing. But during cleaning, that protective
  oxide layer can reform quickly if oxygen sneaks in. This makes zinc different because
  contaminants like salts or oils stick to that oxide, not the metal itself. Your
  approach should target the oxide first—use the laser to vaporize it gently, and
  the underlying dirt comes off easier. Pitfall here: high humidity in your workspace
  can cause re-oxidation mid-job, turning a clean surface dull again. Run your setup
  in a dry area, or add a nitrogen shroud to the laser head. It blocks oxygen and
  lets you hit higher speeds without the zinc pitting.


  Another quirk is zinc''s density at 7140 kg/m³—it''s lightweight for a metal, so
  parts like construction fittings heat up uniformly but cool fast too. This gives
  good thermal shock resistance, handling up to 28 K changes without cracking. So,
  you can ramp power quickly for thick buildup, unlike brittle ceramics. But avoid
  rapid cooling after cleaning; let it air cool to room temperature to prevent micro-stresses.
  In my experience with Indonesian shipyards, where zinc coats hulls, we adjusted
  by doing multiple light passes instead of one heavy one. That keeps the temperature
  under 200°C on the surface, avoiding the boiling point around 907°C.


  Let''s talk settings adjustments head-on, because every job varies. For standard
  zinc hardware, stick to 100 W power with a 1064 nm wavelength—it''s the sweet spot
  for metals like this, penetrating just enough without scattering. If you''re dealing
  with high-reflectivity polished zinc, drop energy density to 1-2 J/cm² initially
  to test absorption. The laser damage threshold is 2.1 J/cm², so stay below that
  or you''ll etch the metal instead of cleaning it. Scan at 500 mm/s, but slow to
  300 mm/s for porous or uneven surfaces, like cast zinc parts. Overlap 50% ensures
  you don''t miss spots, especially on curved automotive pieces.


  Pitfalls to dodge: Don''t ignore the compressive strength—only 28 MPa—so thin zinc
  sheets can dent under clamping. Secure workpieces loosely, and use a fixture that
  allows expansion. Also, zinc''s low porosity at 0% means no hidden voids for contaminants
  to hide, which is a plus, but it also means the surface is smooth (1.6 μm roughness),
  so lasers glance off easier. Roughen it slightly with a pre-pass if needed, but
  that''s rare. In galvanizing apps, watch for zinc-iron alloys; they absorb better,
  so reduce passes to two and up power 20% to match.


  Fracture toughness at 15 MPa√m keeps zinc from shattering under pulses, but its
  Young''s modulus of 108 GPa makes it springy—vibrations from the laser can loosen
  nearby contaminants too much, scattering debris. Contain the area with shields to
  avoid inhaling zinc oxide fumes, which irritate lungs. Always vent well; in my lab
  back in Jakarta, we added exhaust fans after one dusty session.


  For electrical conductivity pros like hardware manufacturing, cleaning zinc improves
  contacts'
