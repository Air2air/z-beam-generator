description: '### Laser Cleaning Zinc: Key Settings and Practical Tips


  Zinc stands out as a soft, low-melting metal that we often see in galvanizing or
  die-casting work. When you clean it with a laser, its high shine and quick heat
  spread make things tricky, but handle it right and you get a clean surface without
  much damage. Zinc''s big strength here is its even heat flow—once the laser energy
  gets in, it spreads fast across the surface, so you avoid hot spots that could warp
  nearby areas. To make use of this, start your cleaning runs slow at first, around
  500 mm/s, and watch how the heat evens out. That way, you remove rust or oxide layers
  without digging too deep into the base metal.


  On the flip side, zinc reflects most laser light—up to 95% bounces right off—which
  means the beam struggles to do its job. This low absorption, just about 5%, slows
  down the cleaning and can waste energy if you''re not careful. What sets zinc apart
  from tougher metals like steel is this mirror-like surface; steel soaks up more
  heat right away, but zinc needs a gentler nudge to start absorbing. Because of that,
  adjust your approach by picking a laser wavelength that zinc grabs onto better,
  like those in the near-infrared range, and crank up the repetition rate to 50 kHz.
  This keeps pulses coming steadily, building heat over time without shocking the
  material. I find that prepping the surface with a light abrasive pass or even a
  quick chemical etch helps cut down on reflection, letting the laser work faster
  from the get-go.


  Zinc melts at around 420°C, much lower than aluminum or iron, so its unusual low
  thermal resistance means you have to stay alert to avoid puddling. This property
  affects your whole setup—high thermal conductivity, about 116 W/m·K, pulls heat
  away quick, but if you push too hard, that low melting point turns it into a liability.
  In practice, this means keeping energy density low, say 5 J/cm² or less, especially
  on thin coatings like galvanized steel where zinc sits on top. I''ve seen teams
  run into trouble by ignoring this; the zinc layer vaporizes unevenly, leaving pits
  or re-depositing fumes back on the surface. To dodge that, use short pulses around
  10 ns and overlap your scans by 50%. This spreads the energy and prevents buildup
  in one spot. Always test on a scrap piece first—zinc''s softness, with a hardness
  of just 35 HB, means even minor overheating can scratch or deform it.


  One pitfall that catches new users is thermal shock. Zinc handles temperature jumps
  up to about 28 K without cracking, but its expansion rate, around 30 parts per million
  per degree, makes it prone to buckling if you cool it too fast after cleaning. So,
  after your passes—aim for 3 at most—let the piece air cool naturally, and avoid
  quenching in water. This keeps the surface flat and ready for the next step, like
  painting or assembly in automotive parts. Another oddity is zinc''s great corrosion
  resistance, losing thickness at only 0.003 mm per year in normal air, but laser
  cleaning can strip that protective oxide if you''re not precise. Focus your beam
  to a tight 50 μm spot size to target just the dirt, and you''ll preserve that natural
  shield. In my experience from die-casting cleanups, this targeted approach cuts
  rework by half.


  When setting up your machine for zinc, power is your main lever—stick to 100 W as
  a baseline, but dial it down to 70-80 W if the surface looks extra shiny or if you''re
  dealing with delicate hardware. High reflectivity throws off the usual rules, so
  monitor the plume; if it''s weak or sporadic, bump the repetition rate or add an
  extra pass. Zinc''s density, around 7,140 kg/m³, keeps it stable under the beam,
  but its low tensile strength of 110 MPa means you can''t blast it like harder alloys.
  Instead, go for multiple light passes to lift contaminants without stressing the
  structure. I remember a construction job where we cleaned zinc roof panels—rushing
  with high power melted edges, but slowing to 300 mm/s with overlaps fixed it, leaving
  a smooth finish under 2 μm roughness.


  What really differentiates zinc cleaning is how its vapor pressure builds fast near
  the boiling point of 907°C. If you hit that, fumes can scatter and redeposit, gumming
  up your nozzle or the workpiece. To counter this, work in a well-ventilated area
  and use a slight assist gas like nitrogen at low pressure—it sweeps away the vapor
  without cooling the spot too much. Unlike copper, which reflects but conducts even
  hotter, zinc''s moderate diffusivity, about 4.2 x 10^-5 m²/s, gives you a window
  to control the process. Start conservative: low power, tight spot, steady speed.
  If ablation kicks in above 1 J/cm², you''re good for removing buildup, but watch
  the damage threshold at 2 J/cm²—cross it and you risk subsurface cracks, especially
  on porous-free but fracture-tough zinc at 15 MPa√m.


  In galvanizing applications, where zinc coats steel for rust protection, laser cleaning
  shines for stripping old layers without harming the base. But here''s a key adjustment:
  zinc''s electrical conductivity, high at 17 million S/m, doesn''t directly play
  in, but it hints at even electron flow, so uniform beam delivery matters. Uneven
  scans can cause hot bands that weaken the coating''s 28 MPa compressive strength.
  Use software to map your path, ensuring 50% overlap, and you''ll maintain that integrity.
  For hardware manufacturing, where zinc dies get gunky from use, the low porosity—zero
  percent—means no hidden traps for residue, but you still need to avoid flexural
  weak points at 110 MPa.


  Pitfalls abound if you treat zinc like stainless steel. Its absorption coefficient
  is high at 65 million m^-1 once it starts taking the energy, but getting there takes
  patience. Don''t crank power early; build it gradually over passes. And forget about
  high-speed blasts—zinc''s thermal shock limit means 500 mm/s is your sweet spot,
  not faster. In automotive trim cleaning, I''ve adjusted by adding a 3-pass protocol:
  first to loosen, second to remove, third to polish. This leverages zinc''s fair
  toughness while'
