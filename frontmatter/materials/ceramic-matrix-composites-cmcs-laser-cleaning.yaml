caption:
  before: The microscopy image of the contaminated Ceramic Matrix Composite surface
    reveals adhered fine particulates and oily residues on fibers and matrix. These
    contaminants, sized 5-40 microns, form irregular clusters in pores and low spots,
    creating uneven coverage. This buildup causes surface degradation, including micro-cracks
    at interfaces and mild pitting. And it shows the need for cleaning to avoid further
    wear and preserve integrity.
  after: After laser cleaning, the CMC surface appears smooth and residue-free. It
    demonstrates high restoration quality, preserving material integrity.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For typical SiC/SiC composites, maintain fluence below 2-4 J/cm² with
      nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. This range effectively removes oxides and carbon
      deposits while preserving the matrix integrity. The precise safe threshold depends
      on your specific fiber type and the initial surface contamination level.
    question: What is the maximum safe laser fluence (J/cm²) for cleaning CMCs without
      damaging the SiC matrix or fiber reinforcement?
  - answer: Using 1064nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence selectively ablates carbonaceous
      soot while preserving Yb₂SiO₅ EBC integrity. Maintain 500 mm/s scan speed with
      50μm spot size to ensure contaminant removal without thermal alteration. Post-process
      verification via optical microscopy confirms surface preservation.
    question: How do I remove environmental contaminants like carbonaceous soot from
      CMC turbine blades without altering the underlying protective EBC (Environmental
      Barrier Coating)?
  - answer: For CMC laser cleaning, 1064nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence provides
      optimal absorption balance. This effectively removes contaminants while preserving
      the SiC matrix and carbon fibers, preventing thermal damage to the composite's
      critical constituents.
    question: What laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm, or 10.6μm) is most effective
      for cleaning CMCs, and why?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can induce micro-cracks in CMCs from thermal shock.
      Using nanosecond pulses at 10 ns and a fluence of 5 J/cm² minimizes this risk
      by limiting heat diffusion. Process monitoring is essential to detect any subsurface
      thermal stress damage.
    question: Can laser cleaning induce micro-cracks or thermal stress damage in the
      CMC's brittle ceramic matrix?
  - answer: The 5 J/cm² fluence generates nanoparticles of SiC and carbon fibers requiring
      HEPA filtration. Maintain industrial hygiene with proper ventilation and respiratory
      protection for operators handling these ultrafine byproducts from CMC laser
      processing.
    question: What are the best practices for handling the nanoparticles and vapors
      generated during laser cleaning of CMCs, especially those with carbon fibers?
  - answer: Properly tuned 1064 nm laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² minimally alters CMC
      topography. It can slightly increase surface roughness by opening sealed pores,
      which often enhances coating adhesion but may require NDE signal compensation
      for accurate inspection.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface roughness and porosity of
      a CMC, and what is the impact on subsequent re-coating or re-inspection?
  - answer: Laser depainting at 5 J/cm² effectively removes organic coatings from
      CMCs with minimal substrate interaction. The primary risk is incomplete paint
      pyrolysis, which can leave carbonaceous residues not found with mechanical methods.
      Proper parameter control is essential to avoid this contamination.
    question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for depainting CMC components, and
      what are the risks of leaving residual chemical contaminants from the paint?
  - answer: For complex CMC airfoils, precise 3D beam delivery is paramount. Galvo
      scanners enable high-speed contour following at 500 mm/s, while closed-loop
      monitoring with LIBS prevents hot spots by ensuring the 5 J/cm² fluence remains
      uniform, thus avoiding thermal damage.
    question: For automated laser cleaning of complex CMC geometries (like airfoils),
      how critical is beam delivery and scanning control to ensure uniform cleaning
      without hot spots?
  - answer: The fundamental difference lies in carbon's high 1064nm absorption and
      oxidation risk versus SiC's higher ablation threshold near 5 J/cm². C/C cleaning
      demands inert gas assist and lower fluence, while SiC/SiC withstands more aggressive
      ns-pulse parameters. This dictates entirely different laser strategies for each
      composite system.
    question: What is the fundamental difference in laser interaction between a SiC/SiC
      CMC and a C/C (Carbon-Carbon) composite, and how does that change the cleaning
      strategy?
  - answer: For CMC surface integrity verification after laser cleaning at 5 J/cm²,
      fluorescent penetrant inspection effectively reveals micro-cracks. Pulsed thermography
      is also highly reliable for detecting subsurface thermal alterations, as it
      maps thermal effusivity changes from potential heat-affected zones without contact.
    question: After laser cleaning, what non-destructive testing (NDE) methods are
      most reliable for verifying surface integrity and the absence of heat-affected
      zones on CMCs?
