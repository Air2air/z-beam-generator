title: Ebony Laser Cleaning
name: Ebony
settings_description: When laser cleaning Ebony, start with low power pulses. This
  dense hardwood responds slowly to the beam. Its tight grain holds heat unevenly.
  You must scan in short passes to even things out. That brings back the deep black
  finish without scorching. Watch for surface checks at the end.

- question: How do I prevent burning ebony during laser cleaning?
  answer: You must start with lower power settings to gently remove surface dirt without
    overheating the dense wood. Ebony's hardness helps it withstand the process, but
    its low heat tolerance means you should use short pulses that clear buildup quickly.
    Keep the laser moving steadily across the surface to avoid hot spots. In my experience,
    this approach restores the natural finish beautifully. Watch out for prolonged
    exposure, as it can char the material and ruin your work.
- question: What's the best practice for cleaning old dirt off ebony artifacts?
  answer: Make sure you test the laser on a small hidden area first to see how the
    ebony responds. The wood's tight grain absorbs energy evenly, so a focused beam
    works well to lift grime without scratching. You'll want to follow up with a soft
    cloth to polish away any residue left behind. This method preserves the ebony's
    deep color and smooth texture effectively.

  before: When we examine ebony's contaminated surface up close, grime layers coat
    every crevice and dull the natural sheen. Dust particles cluster in uneven patches,
    making the texture look rough and clogged. Scratches from wear hide beneath this
    buildup, obscuring the wood's fine details.
  after: After laser treatment, we've found the surface gleams smoothly with no residue
    left behind. The clean texture reveals sharp grain lines that run evenly through
    the material. Polished areas now shine uniformly, bringing back
