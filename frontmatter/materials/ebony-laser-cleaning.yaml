title: Ebony Laser Cleaning
name: Ebony
settings_description: When laser cleaning Ebony, start with low power pulses. This
  dense hardwood responds slowly to the beam. Its tight grain holds heat unevenly.
  You must scan in short passes to even things out. That brings back the deep black
  finish without scorching. Watch for surface checks at the end.
