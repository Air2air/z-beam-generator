caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the ash wood surface displays pretty extensive
    contamination from adhered particulates, such as fine soot and organic residues,
    building a heterogeneous layer up to 50 μm thick. Degradation typically features
    microfissures and delamination along grain boundaries, plus localized discoloration
    and erosion pits measuring 10-20 μm across, fairly undermining structural integrity
    and aesthetic uniformity.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy uncovers a pretty restored ash wood surface,
    boasting pristine cellular structure, minimal ablation residue, and an intact
    lignin matrix. Surface topography displays fairly uniform grain exposure, free
    of thermal damage, for high-fidelity restoration and preserved material integrity
    at the micrometer scale.

faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore the natural grain of aged Ash wood?
  answer: Laser cleaning gently ablates surface contaminants like dirt, varnish, or
    smoke residue from Ash wood without harming the underlying grain. This non-contact
    approach typically preserves the wood's light color and prominent patterns, uncovering
    its original beauty in 10-20 minutes per panel—pretty ideal for antique furniture
    restoration.

  topic_statement: Preserves light color and patterns
- question: What are the risks of using laser cleaning on Ash wood prone to warping?
  answer: Yeah, laser cleaning works pretty safely on Ash wood when handled right.
    It typically dodges the moisture that worsens warping, unlike old methods. Still,
    too much heat risks micro-cracks; experts advise low-power pulsed lasers plus
    close monitoring to avoid that, preserving the wood's flexibility for lasting
    strength.
