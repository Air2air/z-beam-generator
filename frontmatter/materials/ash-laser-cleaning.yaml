caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the ash wood surface displays pretty extensive contamination from adhered particulates, such as fine soot and organic residues, building a heterogeneous layer up to 50 μm thick. Degradation typically features microfissures and delamination along grain boundaries, plus localized discoloration and erosion pits measuring 10-20 μm across, fairly undermining structural integrity and aesthetic uniformity.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy uncovers a pretty restored ash wood surface, boasting pristine cellular structure, minimal ablation residue, and an intact lignin matrix. Surface topography displays fairly uniform grain exposure, free of thermal damage, for high-fidelity restoration and preserved material integrity at the micrometer scale.
faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore the **natural grain** of aged Ash wood?
  answer: '**Preserves light color and patterns**. Laser cleaning gently ablates surface contaminants like dirt, varnish, or smoke residue from Ash wood without harming the underlying grain. This non-contact approach typically preserves the wood''s light color and prominent patterns, uncovering its original beauty in 10-20 minutes per panel—pretty ideal for antique furniture restoration.'
- question: What are the risks of using laser cleaning on Ash wood **prone to warping**?
  answer: '**Low-power pulses prevent micro-cracks**. Yeah, laser cleaning works pretty safely on Ash wood when handled right. It typically dodges the moisture that worsens warping, unlike old methods. Still, too much heat risks micro-cracks; experts advise low-power pulsed lasers plus close monitoring to avoid that, preserving the wood''s flexibility for lasting strength.'
