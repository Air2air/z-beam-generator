title: Gneiss Laser Cleaning
name: Gneiss
settings_description: When laser cleaning gneiss, you'll want to account for its layered
  structure right from the start, as the foliation can lead to uneven energy absorption
  across mineral bands. This makes the process trickier than with uniform stones,
  so begin with reduced power levels to prevent thermal stress from cracking the more
  brittle layers. The material's overall durability helps it withstand cleaning without
  excessive wear, but its variable hardness requires scanning in short bursts to expose
  contaminants evenly while revealing the natural banding underneath. Adjust pulse
  duration to match the surface texture, which improves adhesion removal without compromising
  the stone's integrity. Make sure you monitor for heat buildup, as it reduces the
  risk of delamination in weaker zones. In the end, always test a small area first
  to avoid subsurface damage from overlooked mineral variations.
