title: ABS Laser Cleaning
name: ABS
settings_description: We've found that laser cleaning ABS works smoothly when we keep
  power levels low from the start. This thermoplastic holds up better than brittle
  plastics like polystyrene because of its tough, impact-resistant nature, which lets
  us remove contaminants without cracking the surface right away. Unlike metals that
  reflect energy, ABS absorbs it readily, so we adjust scans to short pulses for even
  coverage. That approach restores the finish cleanly. Just watch out—pushing too
  much heat at the end can cause melting, so always test on a scrap piece first.
