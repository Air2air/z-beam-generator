title: ABS Laser Cleaning
name: ABS
settings_description: We've found that laser cleaning ABS works smoothly when we keep
  power levels low from the start. This thermoplastic holds up better than brittle
  plastics like polystyrene because of its tough, impact-resistant nature, which lets
  us remove contaminants without cracking the surface right away. Unlike metals that
  reflect energy, ABS absorbs it readily, so we adjust scans to short pulses for even
  coverage. That approach restores the finish cleanly. Just watch out—pushing too
  much heat at the end can cause melting, so always test on a scrap piece first.
faq:
- question: How can I avoid warping ABS parts during laser cleaning?
  answer: You must start with lower laser power when cleaning ABS compared to metals
    like steel, since ABS heats up faster and can deform easily. Keep the beam moving
    steadily to spread the heat, which helps prevent uneven expansion unlike more
    rigid materials. This approach maintains the part's shape while removing contaminants
    effectively. Always test on a scrap piece first to fine-tune your settings.
- question: What's the best way to prepare ABS surfaces before laser cleaning?
  answer: When prepping ABS, you should clean it lightly with a soft cloth first,
    unlike oily metals that need solvents, as ABS holds onto residues tightly. Wipe
    away any loose dirt to ensure the laser targets only the contaminants without
    scattering debris. This simple step improves cleaning results and protects the
    underlying thermoplastic structure.
- question: Why does ABS sometimes leave residue after laser cleaning?
  answer: You need to adjust the laser focus closely for ABS, differing from porous
    plastics like wood that absorb energy differently and clean more completely

  before: When examining the contaminated ABS surface at high magnification, I've
    seen layers of grime and particles clinging tightly to the uneven texture. Dust
    and residues scatter across the rough patches, making the whole area look mottled
    and irregular. This buildup hides the material's natural contours, turning a once-smooth
    finish into something clogged and obscured.
  after: After laser treatment on the same ABS surface, the view clears dramatically
    at high magnification, revealing a uniform and pristine layer. Scattered specks
    vanish completely, leaving
