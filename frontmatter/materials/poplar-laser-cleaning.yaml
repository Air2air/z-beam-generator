caption:
  before: Under microscopy, Poplar wood's surface reveals clustered dirt particles
    and oily smears, eroding fibers and causing micro-pitting. This degradation hinders
    effective cleaning in woodworking applications.
  after: Upon completing the cleaning process, the poplar wood surface displays a
    thoroughly restored condition, characterized by its smooth finish, vibrant natural
    color, and intact grain structure, devoid of any contaminants. The restoration
    quality proves exceptional, preserving complete material integrity and preventing
    any potential weakening. This is particularly valuable in applications for crafting
    durable laser optic mounts in the industry.

  questions:
  - answer: For Poplar, use a 1064nm fiber laser at 1.2 J/cm² fluence to effectively
      remove rust while preserving the wood. A 100µm spot size and 500 mm/s scan speed
      provide precise control, minimizing thermal damage. Always test these parameters
      on an inconspicuous area first to verify surface integrity.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters for cleaning rust or contaminants
      from Poplar wood without causing surface burning?
  - answer: Poplar's low 540 lbf Janka hardness requires gentle laser parameters to
      prevent damage. We use a 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold and 500 mm/s scan speed
      to effectively remove contaminants without causing etching or raising the wood
      grain, issues not typically encountered with harder species like oak.
    question: How does Poplar's low density and softness affect laser cleaning compared
      to harder woods like oak?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively strips finishes from Poplar while preserving
      its porous structure. Using 1.2 J/cm² fluence and 100W power, it removes contaminants
      without sealing the wood grain, leaving an ideal surface for uniform stain or
      paint absorption.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare Poplar for painting or staining
      after removing old finishes?
  - answer: Given Poplar's combustibility, maintain laser power below 100W and a rapid
      scan speed of 500 mm/s to prevent ignition. Always use air assist and have a
      fire extinguisher immediately available, as the 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold
      is critical for safety.
    question: What specific safety concerns exist when laser cleaning Poplar, given
      its combustible nature?
  - answer: Properly tuned near-infrared lasers at 1.2 J/cm² effectively ablate biological
      growth from Poplar. The 10 ns pulse width vaporizes contaminants before significant
      heat penetrates the wood's cellulose, offering a superior, residue-free alternative
      to chemical spore treatments.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing biological growth (mold, mildew)
      from Poplar without damaging the wood structure?
  - answer: Poplar's mineral streaks absorb our 1064 nm wavelength more readily than
      the surrounding wood, creating differential cleaning effects. To compensate,
      reduce your fluence to 1.0 J/cm² and increase scan speed to prevent discoloration
      across the variable grain.
    question: How does the presence of Poplar's green/brown mineral streaks affect
      laser absorption and cleaning results?
  - answer: Given Poplar's delicate cellular structure, removal depth is extremely
      limited. Stay below 50-100 μm to preserve integrity. For structural applications,
      maintain fluence under 1.2 J/cm² to avoid compromising the thin cell walls.
      Cosmetic cleaning allows slightly more latitude.
    question: What is the maximum depth of contamination removal possible on Poplar
      before structural integrity is compromised?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser ablation at 1.2 J/cm² effectively removes the gray
      oxidized layer from Poplar, revealing the lighter wood beneath. Unlike sanding,
      this non-contact method avoids generating heat-induced discoloration, restoring
      a more authentic original surface color.
    question: Can laser cleaning restore the original color of aged or oxidized Poplar
      wood surfaces?
  - answer: While both subspecies respond well to 1064 nm wavelength, Tulip Poplar's
      marginally higher density requires careful fluence control near 1.2 J/cm² to
      prevent subsurface cell wall damage. Yellow Poplar, with its slightly lower
      resin content, allows for more forgiving parameter windows, particularly with
      a 100 µm spot size for precise grain cleaning.
    question: How do different Poplar subspecies (Yellow Poplar, Tulip Poplar) respond
      to laser cleaning treatments?
  - answer: After laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm², Poplar's opened grain structure benefits
      from a penetrating oil-based sealer. This stabilizes the surface by rehydrating
      raised fibers and preventing oxidative discoloration. For porous areas, a dilute
      wood consolidant applied before final sealing ensures long-term dimensional
      stability.
    question: What post-cleaning treatments are recommended for Poplar after laser
      cleaning to stabilize the surface?
