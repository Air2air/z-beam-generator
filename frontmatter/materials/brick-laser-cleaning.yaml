caption:
  before: Under microscopy, brick surfaces reveal clustered dirt particles and oily residues, leading to pitting and faded
    coloration. This degradation complicates laser-based cleaning in restoration projects.
  after: After thorough cleaning, the brick surface emerges smooth and vibrant, with restored original color and texture that
    preserves material integrity. No erosion or weakening occurs, maintaining structural strength for masonry in commercial
    facades.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For historical brick, begin with conservative settings around 12 J/cm² fluence and 100W average power. Always
      perform test patches first, as heavy carbon deposits may require slightly higher energy than light soot. The 1064 nm
      wavelength is ideal for removing contaminants while preserving the fragile brick substrate.
    question: What laser settings work best for cleaning soot and pollution stains from historical brick without damaging
      the surface?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint and graffiti from brick without chemicals or abrasives. Using a
      1064 nm wavelength at approximately 12 J/cm², the process vaporizes coatings like acrylics and spray paints while preserving
      the porous substrate. Typically, 2-3 passes are needed to eliminate pigment residue from the masonry's texture, offering
      a superior, controlled alternative to traditional methods.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove paint and graffiti from brick without using chemicals or abrasives?
  - answer: Properly tuned near-IR lasers at 1064 nm with ~12 J/cm² fluence remove contaminants without altering brick's color.
      The mineral composition remains intact, preserving the original patina while avoiding surface fusion or thermal darkening.
    question: Does laser cleaning cause any color change or surface fusion on brick surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12 J/cm² fluence selectively removes contaminants without abrasion, preserving delicate mortar
      joints. Unlike sandblasting, it maintains the brick's original surface profile and eliminates harmful dust production,
      ensuring structural integrity.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to sandblasting for brick restoration in terms of surface damage and mortar
      preservation?
  - answer: When cleaning brick at 100 W and 1064 nm, the primary hazard is respirable crystalline silica dust. You must use
      a NIOSH-approved P100 respirator and local exhaust ventilation to capture these fine particulates, especially if lead-based
      paint is present.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning brick, especially regarding silica dust and lead paint?
  - answer: The pink hue results from thermal reduction of iron oxides in the clay at fluences near 12 J/cm². This chemical
      state is generally permanent, but it doesn't indicate structural damage to the brick substrate.
    question: Why does brick sometimes turn pink or orange after laser cleaning, and is this permanent?
  - answer: For heavy biological growth on brick, we achieve optimal removal at 500 mm/s with 100W systems using 12 J/cm²
      fluence. The 1064nm wavelength effectively eliminates surface growth while preserving the masonry, though deep root
      systems may need complementary treatments.
    question: What's the maximum removal rate for heavy biological growth (lichens, moss) from brick using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Soft mud bricks require lower fluence around 12 J/cm² due to high porosity, while dense engineering types tolerate
      higher power. Always test refractory materials first, as their composition can create thermal stress at standard 100W
      settings.
    question: How do different brick types (soft mud, pressed, engineering, fire) respond differently to laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12 J/cm² effectively removes surface efflorescence from brick. However, without addressing the
      underlying moisture source, salts will quickly return from the porous substrate. For lasting results, integrate this
      process with waterproofing treatments to prevent capillary moisture transport.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove efflorescence salts from brick masonry, or will they quickly return?
  - answer: While initial laser setup requires investment, its 500 mm/s scan speed delivers superior cost-efficiency per square
      meter over time. The 1064 nm wavelength preserves the brick substrate, eliminating abrasive damage and costly mortar
      replacement. This selective cleaning significantly reduces long-term maintenance cycles, offering substantial economic
      benefits for large-scale facades.
    question: What are the economic considerations when choosing laser cleaning over chemical or abrasive methods for large
      brick facades?
