caption:
  before: Under microscopy, brick surfaces reveal clustered dirt particles and oily
    residues, leading to pitting and faded coloration. This degradation complicates
    laser-based cleaning in restoration projects.
  after: After thorough cleaning, the brick surface emerges smooth and vibrant, with
    restored original color and texture that preserves material integrity. No erosion
    or weakening occurs, maintaining structural strength for masonry in commercial
    facades.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For historical brick, begin with conservative settings around 12 J/cm²
      fluence and 100W average power. Always perform test patches first, as heavy
      carbon deposits may require slightly higher energy than light soot. The 1064
      nm wavelength is ideal for removing contaminants while preserving the fragile
      brick substrate.
    question: What laser settings work best for cleaning soot and pollution stains
      from historical brick without damaging the surface?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint and graffiti from brick
      without chemicals or abrasives. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at approximately
      12 J/cm², the process vaporizes coatings like acrylics and spray paints while
      preserving the porous substrate. Typically, 2-3 passes are needed to eliminate
      pigment residue from the masonry's texture, offering a superior, controlled
      alternative to traditional methods.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove paint and graffiti from brick without using
      chemicals or abrasives?
  - answer: Properly tuned near-IR lasers at 1064 nm with ~12 J/cm² fluence remove
      contaminants without altering brick's color. The mineral composition remains
      intact, preserving the original patina while avoiding surface fusion or thermal
      darkening.
    question: Does laser cleaning cause any color change or surface fusion on brick
      surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12 J/cm² fluence selectively removes contaminants without
      abrasion, preserving delicate mortar joints. Unlike sandblasting, it maintains
      the brick's original surface profile and eliminates harmful dust production,
      ensuring structural integrity.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to sandblasting for brick restoration
      in terms of surface damage and mortar preservation?
  - answer: When cleaning brick at 100 W and 1064 nm, the primary hazard is respirable
      crystalline silica dust. You must use a NIOSH-approved P100 respirator and local
      exhaust ventilation to capture these fine particulates, especially if lead-based
      paint is present.
    question: What safety precautions are specific to laser cleaning brick, especially
      regarding silica dust and lead paint?
  - answer: The pink hue results from thermal reduction of iron oxides in the clay
      at fluences near 12 J/cm². This chemical state is generally permanent, but it
      doesn't indicate structural damage to the brick substrate.
    question: Why does brick sometimes turn pink or orange after laser cleaning, and
      is this permanent?
  - answer: For heavy biological growth on brick, we achieve optimal removal at 500
      mm/s with 100W systems using 12 J/cm² fluence. The 1064nm wavelength effectively
      eliminates surface growth while preserving the masonry, though deep root systems
      may need complementary treatments.
    question: What's the maximum removal rate for heavy biological growth (lichens,
      moss) from brick using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Soft mud bricks require lower fluence around 12 J/cm² due to high porosity,
      while dense engineering types tolerate higher power. Always test refractory
      materials first, as their composition can create thermal stress at standard
      100W settings.
    question: How do different brick types (soft mud, pressed, engineering, fire)
      respond differently to laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12 J/cm² effectively removes surface efflorescence from
      brick. However, without addressing the underlying moisture source, salts will
      quickly return from the porous substrate. For lasting results, integrate this
      process with waterproofing treatments to prevent capillary moisture transport.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove efflorescence salts from brick
      masonry, or will they quickly return?
  - answer: While initial laser setup requires investment, its 500 mm/s scan speed
      delivers superior cost-efficiency per square meter over time. The 1064 nm wavelength
      preserves the brick substrate, eliminating abrasive damage and costly mortar
      replacement. This selective cleaning significantly reduces long-term maintenance
      cycles, offering substantial economic benefits for large-scale facades.
    question: What are the economic considerations when choosing laser cleaning over
      chemical or abrasive methods for large brick facades?
