caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the oak surface displays a contaminated condition
    with irregular topography. Adherent particles—fine dust grains and oily residues—cluster
    within the porous wood fibers, measuring 1-10 microns in size and exhibiting amorphous
    shapes. This buildup fosters surface degradation, manifesting as micro-fissures,
    fiber erosion, and localized discoloration, which undermine the material's structural
    integrity for cleaning and manufacturing applications.
  after: The cleaned oak surface gleams smoothly, its natural grain restored vividly.
    Quality restoration preserves full material integrity without compromise.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² using a 100W source at 500 mm/s to ablate
      charring without carbonizing the lignin. A 100µm spot size provides precise
      control. Employ multiple low-power passes, rather than a single aggressive one,
      to manage thermal input and preserve the wood's integrity.
    question: How do I remove black charring from oak when laser cleaning without
      damaging the wood?
  - answer: For oak beam cleaning, I recommend nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength
      with approximately 100 W average power. Begin testing with a fluence near 2.5
      J/cm² and a 100 µm spot size. This combination effectively ablates soot while
      minimizing thermal diffusion into the wood substrate, preventing charring.
    question: What are the ideal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning soot and dirt from an oak beam?
  - answer: With precise 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot control, a laser can selectively
      ablate paint from antique oak. This preserves the patina by avoiding the differential
      erosion of soft earlywood that plagues mechanical methods.
    question: Can a laser safely remove old paint or varnish from an antique oak piece
      without altering the patina?
  - answer: UV laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² effectively deactivates surface mold spores
      on oak. However, it cannot eliminate deep hyphal growth, necessitating a combined
      biocidal treatment. Crucially, proper HEPA filtration is mandatory to manage
      aerosolized spores during the process.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for decontaminating mold or biological growth
      from oak in heritage conservation?
  - answer: Oak laser cleaning at 100W and 2.5 J/cm² generates hazardous aldehydes
      and acetic acid fumes. Fine wood dust also presents a significant explosion
      risk, necessitating robust fume extraction with P3 respiratory protection and
      integrated spark detection systems for operator safety.
    question: What specific safety hazards exist when laser cleaning oak, especially
      regarding fumes and particulates?
  - answer: Oak's alternating porous and dense grain causes differential ablation
      at our 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This can create a slightly textured surface, requiring
      multi-directional passes at 500 mm/s to ensure uniform cleaning across the entire
      grain structure.
    question: How does the density and grain structure of oak affect the laser cleaning
      process and final result?
  - answer: Laser cleaning on oak is inherently superficial, removing just 10-50 microns
      per pass. Exceeding this risks degrading the cellular structure. The key is
      using a low fluence, around 2.5 J/cm², and limiting passes to preserve the wood's
      integrity.
    question: What is the maximum depth of material removal possible on oak with a
      laser before structural integrity is compromised?
  - answer: Success is confirmed via colorimetry showing ΔE<5 for acceptable lightening,
      avoiding charring. Microscopy must reveal intact cell walls at 100µm resolution.
      Maintain 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power to prevent surface roughening.
    question: How do I evaluate the success of a laser cleaning treatment on oak,
      and what are the acceptable post-treatment changes?
  - answer: The white residue is micro-charred lignin from excessive fluence above
      the 2.5 J/cm² threshold. To prevent this, reduce your laser power or increase
      the scan speed beyond 500 mm/s. A final, gentle pass at lower energy will effectively
      remove the remaining ash without damaging the oak substrate.
    question: Why does my laser leave a white, ashy residue on the oak surface after
      cleaning, and how can I prevent it?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels for delicate oak artifacts like historical furniture
      or violins, where our 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size remove contaminants
      with micron-level precision. This prevents substrate loss, unlike aggressive
      soda blasting, making it ideal for high-value conservation where the original
      surface integrity is paramount.
    question: For which applications is laser cleaning oak most suitable compared
      to traditional methods like soda blasting or chemical stripping?
