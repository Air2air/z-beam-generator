caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated Onyx surface shows a layer of fine dust particles
    and oily residues clinging to its pores. These contaminants, mostly mineral-based
    and unevenly distributed, cause subtle discoloration and block natural sheen.
    The stone exhibits early degradation with micro-pitting and faint scratches, and
    this affects its durability in everyday cleaning uses.
  after: This cleaned Onyx surface reveals a restored polish and even texture. It
    maintains strong material integrity, and the restoration quality supports long-term
    durability.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning Onyx, a nylon composite with carbon fiber, requires careful
      fluence control near 5.1 J/cm². The process risks generating hazardous hydrogen
      cyanide gas from the polymer matrix. Therefore, robust fume extraction and certified
      respiratory protection are absolutely mandatory for operator safety during this
      procedure.
    question: Is Onyx safe to laser clean, or does it produce hazardous fumes?
  - answer: For Onyx, use a 1064nm wavelength at 100W average power with 10ns pulses.
      Maintain fluence below 5.1 J/cm² to ablate soot while preserving the stone's
      integrity. A 50μm spot size scanned at 500mm/s effectively removes contaminants
      without thermal damage.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning soot or oxidation from Onyx without damaging the surface?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes support material from Onyx parts.
      Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² selectively ablates the polymer interface
      without etching the stone substrate, offering a significant advantage over abrasive
      methods that risk surface scarring.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove support material from 3D printed Onyx parts
      effectively?
  - answer: For SLS Onyx, use 5.1 J/cm² to remove trapped powder from its porous surface.
      For FFF parts, a lower fluence at 500 mm/s effectively cleans layer lines without
      melting the polymer matrix. The key is adjusting energy for their distinct surface
      topographies.
    question: How do you clean a laser-sintered Onyx (SLS) part versus a FFF-printed
      Onyx part with laser?
  - answer: Properly controlled laser cleaning preserves Onyx's structural integrity.
      Using a 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size, we effectively ablate contaminants
      without inducing thermal stress or dimensional changes that could compromise
      mechanical strength.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the dimensional accuracy or mechanical strength
      of an Onyx part?
  - answer: For Onyx, the carbon fibers readily absorb laser energy, requiring conservative
      settings like 5.1 J/cm² fluence to prevent charring. This is more critical than
      for pure nylon, where higher energy can often be tolerated without such thermal
      damage.
    question: What is the best way to clean carbon fiber-filled materials like Onyx
      compared to unfilled nylons?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning with ~5.1 J/cm² fluence preserves Onyx's
      original polish. However, excessive energy can induce a localized matte texture
      from micro-ablation. This purely cosmetic change may affect subsequent finishing
      steps, requiring a light repolish for high-gloss applications.
    question: After laser cleaning Onyx, is the surface left with a different texture
      or color?
  - answer: For Onyx laser cleaning, consult MSDS for silica content and adhere to
      OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 for respiratory protection. The 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1
      J/cm² minimizes subsurface damage, but air monitoring is essential for crystalline
      silica fume exposure, which requires specific PELs.
    question: Are there any specific certifications or regulatory guidelines for laser
      cleaning composite materials like Onyx in an industrial setting?
