caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the contaminated Onyx surface reveals a layer of fine
    dust particles and oily residues adhering to its pores. These contaminants, particularly
    mineral-based and unevenly distributed, lead to subtle discoloration while blocking
    the natural sheen. Notably, the stone displays early degradation via micro-pitting
    and faint scratches, thus compromising its durability for everyday cleaning.
  after: The cleaned Onyx surface notably displays a restored polish and even texture.
    It preserves strong material integrity, thus ensuring long-term durability via
    superior restoration quality.

faq:
- answer: Laser cleaning of Onyx, a carbon fiber-reinforced nylon composite, demands
    precise fluence management around 5.1 J/cm². Notably, the process can release
    hazardous hydrogen cyanide gas from the polymer matrix. Thus, effective fume extraction
    and certified respiratory protection remain essential for ensuring operator safety.
  question: Is Onyx safe to laser clean, or does it produce hazardous fumes?
  topic_keyword: hazardous fumes
  topic_statement: Generates hydrogen cyanide gas
- answer: Specifically for Onyx, employ a 1064nm wavelength at 100W average power
    with 10ns pulses. Keep fluence below 5.1 J/cm² to ablate soot while preserving
    the stone's integrity. Notably, a 50μm spot size scanned at 500mm/s removes contaminants
    effectively without thermal damage.
  question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
    for cleaning soot or oxidation from Onyx without damaging the surface?
  topic_keyword: without damaging the surface
  topic_statement: Fluence below 5.1 J/cm²
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes support material from Onyx parts,
    particularly at the polymer interface. Specifically, a 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1
    J/cm² ablates it without etching the stone substrate, thus offering a significant
    advantage over abrasive methods that risk surface scarring.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove support material from 3D printed Onyx parts
    effectively?
  topic_keyword: 3D printed Onyx parts
  topic_statement: Selectively ablates polymer interface
- answer: Particularly for SLS Onyx, apply 5.1 J/cm² to clear trapped powder from
    its porous surface. In FFF parts, a lower fluence at 500 mm/s effectively removes
    layer lines without melting the polymer matrix. Thus, tailoring energy to their
    unique surface topographies proves essential.
  question: How do you clean a laser-sintered Onyx (SLS) part versus a FFF-printed
    Onyx part with laser?
- answer: Properly controlled laser cleaning particularly preserves Onyx's structural
    integrity. Notably, with a 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size, we ablate contaminants
    effectively without inducing thermal stress or dimensional changes that could
    compromise mechanical strength.
  question: Does laser cleaning affect the dimensional accuracy or mechanical strength
    of an Onyx part?
- answer: For Onyx, the carbon fibers particularly absorb laser energy readily, thus
    requiring conservative settings like 5.1 J/cm² fluence to avoid charring. This
    proves more critical than for pure nylon, where higher energies can typically
    be tolerated without such thermal damage.
  question: What is the best way to clean carbon fiber-filled materials like Onyx
    compared to unfilled nylons?
- answer: When laser cleaning is tuned precisely to ~5.1 J/cm² fluence, it particularly
    preserves Onyx's original polish. Yet, excessive energy may create a localized
    matte texture through micro-ablation. This cosmetic alteration notably influences
    later finishing processes, thus necessitating a light repolish for high-gloss
    results.
  question: After laser cleaning Onyx, is the surface left with a different texture
    or color?
  topic_keyword: different texture or color
  topic_statement: Preserves original polish
- answer: For Onyx laser cleaning, consult the MSDS particularly for silica content
    while adhering to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 on respiratory protection. Notably, the
    1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² reduces subsurface damage; however, air monitoring
    proves essential against crystalline silica fume exposure, thus demanding specific
    PELs.
  question: Are there any specific certifications or regulatory guidelines for laser
    cleaning composite materials like Onyx in an industrial setting?
