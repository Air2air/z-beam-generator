caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated Onyx surface shows a layer of fine dust particles and oily residues clinging to its pores. These contaminants, mostly mineral-based and unevenly distributed, cause subtle discoloration and block natural sheen. The stone exhibits early degradation with micro-pitting and faint scratches, and this affects its durability in everyday cleaning uses.
  after: This cleaned Onyx surface reveals a restored polish and even texture. It maintains strong material integrity, and the restoration quality supports long-term durability.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning Onyx, a nylon composite with carbon fiber, requires careful fluence control near 5.1 J/cm². The process risks generating hazardous hydrogen cyanide gas from the polymer matrix. Therefore, robust fume extraction and certified respiratory protection are absolutely mandatory for operator safety during this procedure.
    question: Is Onyx safe to laser clean, or does it produce hazardous fumes?
  - answer: For Onyx, use a 1064nm wavelength at 100W average power with 10ns pulses. Maintain fluence below 5.1 J/cm² to ablate soot while preserving the stone's integrity. A 50μm spot size scanned at 500mm/s effectively removes contaminants without thermal damage.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning soot or oxidation from Onyx without damaging the surface?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes support material from Onyx parts. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² selectively ablates the polymer interface without etching the stone substrate, offering a significant advantage over abrasive methods that risk surface scarring.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove support material from 3D printed Onyx parts effectively?
  - answer: For SLS Onyx, use 5.1 J/cm² to remove trapped powder from its porous surface. For FFF parts, a lower fluence at 500 mm/s effectively cleans layer lines without melting the polymer matrix. The key is adjusting energy for their distinct surface topographies.
    question: How do you clean a laser-sintered Onyx (SLS) part versus a FFF-printed Onyx part with laser?
  - answer: Properly controlled laser cleaning preserves Onyx's structural integrity. Using a 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 50 µm spot size, we effectively ablate contaminants without inducing thermal stress or dimensional changes that could compromise mechanical strength.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the dimensional accuracy or mechanical strength of an Onyx part?
  - answer: For Onyx, the carbon fibers readily absorb laser energy, requiring conservative settings like 5.1 J/cm² fluence to prevent charring. This is more critical than for pure nylon, where higher energy can often be tolerated without such thermal damage.
    question: What is the best way to clean carbon fiber-filled materials like Onyx compared to unfilled nylons?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser cleaning with ~5.1 J/cm² fluence preserves Onyx's original polish. However, excessive energy can induce a localized matte texture from micro-ablation. This purely cosmetic change may affect subsequent finishing steps, requiring a light repolish for high-gloss applications.
    question: After laser cleaning Onyx, is the surface left with a different texture or color?
  - answer: For Onyx laser cleaning, consult MSDS for silica content and adhere to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 for respiratory protection. The 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² minimizes subsurface damage, but air monitoring is essential for crystalline silica fume exposure, which requires specific PELs.
    question: Are there any specific certifications or regulatory guidelines for laser cleaning composite materials like Onyx in an industrial setting?
