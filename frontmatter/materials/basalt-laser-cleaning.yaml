caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the contaminated basalt surface displays a rough, pitted
    terrain notably scattered with fine dust particles and oily residues. These contaminants
    particularly clog the natural pores, leading to discoloration, micro-cracks, and
    dullness. Thus, it signals early degradation, undermining the stone's integrity
    for routine cleaning uses.
  after: Notably, the laser-cleaned basalt surface exhibits smooth, even restoration.
    Material integrity holds strong, thus leaving the stone's natural durability intact.

faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore the natural appearance of weathered basalt
    surfaces?
  answer: Laser cleaning employs precise energy pulses to eliminate dirt, grime, and
    oxidation layers from basalt, particularly without harming the stone itself. Notably,
    this non-abrasive approach restores the original dark luster and texture, thus
    boosting durability while safeguarding historical or architectural value in just
    a few sessions.

  topic_statement: Revives dark luster and texture
- question: Can laser cleaning address the brittleness issues in basalt structures?
  answer: 'Yes, but indirectly: it cleans contaminants that exacerbate cracking, thus
    improving surface integrity. However, specifically for inherent brittleness, combine
    with sealants post-cleaning to boost resistance.'
