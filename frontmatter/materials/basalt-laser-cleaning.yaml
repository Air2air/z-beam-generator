caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated basalt surface reveals a rough and pitted
    landscape dotted with fine dust particles and oily residues. These contaminants
    fill the natural pores, causing discoloration, micro-cracks, and dullness. The
    surface, it demonstrates early degradation signs, weakening the stone's integrity
    for general cleaning applications.
  after: The laser-cleaned basalt surface shows a smooth, even restoration. Material
    integrity stays strong, and the stone's natural durability remains unchanged.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For basalt laser cleaning, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with 100 W average
      power and 10 ns pulses. Maintain fluence around 12 J/cm² at 500 mm/s scanning
      speed to effectively remove contaminants while preserving the mineral structure.
      These parameters ensure thorough cleaning without thermal damage to the stone
      surface.
    question: What laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best
      for cleaning contaminants from basalt without damaging the stone surface?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning preserves basalt's dark surface. Using
      1064 nm wavelength and 12 J/cm² fluence, we selectively ablate contaminants
      without thermally altering the iron-rich matrix. This prevents the whitening
      or melting that can occur from excessive energy deposition into the mineral
      structure.
    question: Does laser cleaning cause discoloration or thermal damage to basalt's
      dark surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes lichen from historic basalt at 12 J/cm²,
      preserving the porous stone matrix. This non-chemical method eliminates biological
      growth without residual toxins, significantly reducing the potential for future
      regrowth compared to traditional treatments.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing lichen and biological growth
      from historic basalt structures?
  - answer: Basalt laser cleaning generates respirable crystalline silica dust requiring
      HEPA filtration. Our 100W, 1064nm process demands industrial-grade extraction
      systems to maintain airborne particulates below 0.025 mg/m³ OSHA limits. Proper
      respiratory protection is essential during this ablation procedure.
    question: What safety considerations are specific to laser cleaning basalt, particularly
      regarding fume extraction and particulate matter?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively handles rough basalt textures with proper 100
      μm spot sizing and 50% overlap. Strategic 500 mm/s scanning mitigates shadowing
      in crevices. The 1064 nm wavelength and 12 J/cm² fluence ensure uniform contaminant
      removal across natural stone variations without substrate damage.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used on rough, textured basalt surfaces or is
      it only effective on smooth finishes?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 12 J/cm² fluence offers superior surface preservation
      versus abrasive methods. This non-contact approach selectively removes contaminants
      while maintaining basalt's original texture, ensuring long-term durability without
      chemical residue or micro-fracturing risks.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sandblasting,
      chemical cleaning) for restoration of basalt monuments?
  - answer: Industrial basalt's thick contamination layers demand higher fluence—exceeding
      12 J/cm²—which reduces throughput. Aged installations often require multiple
      passes at slower scan speeds below 500 mm/s, making the process less efficient
      than controlled lab conditions.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily soiled industrial
      basalt surfaces compared to laboratory conditions?
  - answer: Proper laser parameters like 12 J/cm² fluence maintain basalt's inherent
      low porosity. This controlled ablation removes contaminants without increasing
      permeability, preserving the stone's natural weathering resistance for long-term
      exterior durability.
    question: Does laser treatment affect the water absorption properties or weathering
      resistance of basalt surfaces?
  - answer: For basalt's dark surface, combine visual inspection with optical microscopy
      to assess contaminant removal. Non-destructive techniques like surface roughness
      measurement and colorimetric analysis verify cleaning effectiveness without
      damage. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 12 J/cm² fluence ensures complete removal
      while preserving the substrate integrity.
    question: What diagnostic methods are used to verify cleaning effectiveness on
      basalt without damaging the surface?
  - answer: Basalt's heterogeneous mineralogy creates differential absorption at 1064
      nm, with plagioclase and pyroxene responding variably to the 12 J/cm² fluence.
      This necessitates optimized parameters like 500 mm/s scan speed to ensure uniform
      contaminant removal across all crystalline phases without inducing selective
      ablation that could etch the surface.
    question: How does basalt's mineral composition (plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine)
      affect laser interaction and cleaning efficiency?
