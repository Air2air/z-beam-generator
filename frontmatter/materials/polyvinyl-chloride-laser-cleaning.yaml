description: When laser cleaning polyvinyl chloride, you must watch its low heat tolerance
  right from the start—it's a thermoplastic that softens quickly under intense energy,
  leading to warping or melting if you're not careful. This makes it different from
  metals, where heat spreads out fast; here, the energy stays localized because it
  doesn't conduct heat well, so you risk damaging the surface before buildup even
  clears. Start with reduced power to build up gradually, and keep scan speeds high
  to limit exposure time on any spot. You'll find it absorbs laser light readily,
  which helps remove contaminants efficiently without much reflection loss, but always
  test on a small area first to avoid pitting. For best results, use multiple light
  passes with good overlap, letting it cool between them—this restores the smooth
  finish on pipes or panels without compromising its corrosion resistance or flexibility.
