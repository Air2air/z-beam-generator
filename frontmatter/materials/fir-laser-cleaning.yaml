caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the fir wood surface appears heavily contaminated by dirt
    particles and sticky oils that cling tightly then degrade fibers. Rough-rough
    pits form, so texture worsens and natural protection weakens.
  after: The fir wood surface is cleaned thoroughly-thoroughly by the ultrafast laser
    process, removing contaminants and then restoring its natural appearance. The
    cleaned surface appears smooth-smooth and fresh-fresh, with grain patterns visible
    clearly and color even-even. Restoration quality is high-high, as material integrity
    remains intact-intact—no fibers damaged, so strength preserved well. This method
    ensures wood suitable for general applications, clean and ready-ready for use.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk membersihkan Fir, gunakan laser Nd:YAG 1064 nm dengan fluence rendah
      ~1.2 J/cm² untuk menghindari karbonisasi lignin. Pengaturan nanodetik 10 ns
      dan kecepatan pindai 500 mm/s efektif menghilangkan jelaga tanpa mengabasi substrat.
      Selalu uji area kecil terlebih dahulu untuk memverifikasi tidak terjadi yellowing.
    question: What are the optimal laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning soot or biological growth from Fir wood without causing ablation
      or yellowing?
  - answer: Fir's variable resin content requires careful fluence control around 1.2
      J/cm². Resin pockets vaporize faster than wood, risking uneven surfaces. I recommend
      a lower-power initial scan at 500 mm/s to identify these areas, followed by
      targeted passes to prevent resin bleed into the cleaned zones.
    question: How does the variable resin content in Fir wood affect the laser cleaning
      process and how do we adjust for it?
  - answer: A fiber laser can remove lead paint from Fir clapboard using ~1.2 J/cm²
      fluence and 100 µm spot size. Precise parameter control is critical to avoid
      etching the softwood grain, and a HEPA fume extractor is mandatory for hazardous
      lead particulate.
    question: Can a fiber laser effectively remove old, lead-based paint from Fir
      clapboard without damaging the softwood surface underneath?
  - answer: Fir wood's thermal degradation threshold is approximately 150-200°C, beyond
      which permanent discoloration and charring occur. Maintain surface temperatures
      below this range using IR thermography, especially with a 1.2 J/cm² fluence
      and 100 µm spot size, to preserve its structural integrity.
    question: What is the maximum safe surface temperature for Fir during laser cleaning
      to prevent degradation of its structural or aesthetic properties?
  - answer: When cleaning Fir at 1.2 J/cm², use a HEPA/ULPA extraction system to capture
      explosive wood dust and lead fumes. A P100 respirator is mandatory for operators
      due to hazardous pyrolysis by-products generated from the wood substrate.
    question: What specific safety precautions and fume extraction systems are required
      when laser cleaning Fir, especially when removing paints or contaminants?
  - answer: Success is determined by maintaining the original patina. We use colorimetry
      to ensure ΔE remains below 3 and microscopy to confirm the 100 µm spot size
      avoids micro-charting. Minimal, uniform lightening is acceptable, but any darkening
      from carbonization is a failure.
    question: How do you evaluate the success of laser cleaning on Fir? What are the
      acceptable levels of micro-burning or changes to the original patina?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively decontaminates Fir wood by utilizing 1064 nm
      wavelength light, which is absorbed by mold, causing rapid thermal ablation.
      With a fluence of 1.2 J/cm² and 100 W power, we can eradicate surface spores
      without carbonizing the substrate. However, deeply embedded mycelial networks
      may persist, requiring potential multi-pass treatment.
    question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for decontaminating Fir wood affected
      by mold or fungi without using chemicals?
  - answer: Laser-cleaned Fir appears lighter when removing darkened patina or darker
      from slight carbonization at excessive fluence. Maintain 1.2 J/cm² fluence and
      a 500 mm/s scan speed with 50% beam overlap. This ensures uniform contaminant
      removal while preserving the wood's natural color for a consistent finish.
    question: Why does laser-cleaned Fir sometimes appear lighter or darker than the
      surrounding untreated wood, and how can this be minimized?
