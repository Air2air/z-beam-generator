caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the GFRP surface appears very-very rough and uneven, with contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues clinging tightly to the fibers. These contaminants form irregular clusters, blocking matrix interfaces and causing discoloration. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and fiber pull-outs, so the material looks weakened and porous, then invites further damage if not cleaned promptly.
  after: The cleaned surface of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) appears very-very smooth and glossy, with contaminants fully removed then original texture restored. This process cleans effectively so material integrity remains intact—no delamination or fiber damage occurs. Restoration quality is high, as surface looks pristine and ready for applications, maintaining composite strength and durability.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk GFRP, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluensi di bawah 2.5 J/cm² untuk menghindari ablasi resin. Densitas energi optimal 3.0 J/cm² dan lebar pulsa nanodetik mengontrol interaksi material, melindungi serat kaca sambil membersihkan kontaminan permukaan secara efektif tanpa merusak matriks komposit.
    question: What laser parameters are safe for cleaning GFRP without damaging the glass fibers or resin matrix?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes silicone, wax, and PVA release agents from GFRP molds. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² ensures contaminant ablation while preserving the mold's dimensional integrity. This method maintains surface quality without thermal damage to the composite matrix.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove release agents from GFRP molds without affecting the surface quality?
  - answer: Laser cleaning achieves superior surface preparation at 3.0 J/cm², enhancing adhesion without the subsurface damage from abrasives. This non-contact process with a 100 µm spot size preserves the GFRP's mechanical integrity, unlike grit blasting which can weaken the fiber-matrix interface.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to abrasive methods for GFRP surface preparation before bonding or painting?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent hazardous fume generation from resin decomposition. Use local exhaust ventilation and respiratory protection, as thermal degradation releases styrene and formaldehyde exceeding workplace exposure limits.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning GFRP due to potential hazardous fumes?
  - answer: Dengan parameter optimal seperti fluence 2.5 J/cm² dan scanning 500 mm/s, laser cleaning dapat menghilangkan kontaminan tanpa merusak matriks GFRP. Analisis mikroskopis mengonfirmasi tidak adanya micro-cracks yang signifikan, sehingga integritas struktural material komposit tetap terjaga.
    question: Does laser cleaning create micro-cracks or thermal damage in the GFRP matrix that could compromise structural integrity?
  - answer: Near-IR wavelengths around 1064 nm are optimal for GFRP cleaning. This provides strong absorption in surface contaminants while the glass fibers remain highly transparent, enabling effective removal at ~2.5 J/cm² without damaging the composite substrate.
    question: What laser wavelength (UV, IR, etc.) works best for GFRP cleaning and why?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes surface contaminants from GFRP using a 1064 nm wavelength and fluence near 2.5 J/cm². This selectively ablates oils or paints while preserving the underlying composite matrix, verified through microscopic inspection for any fiber exposure.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing contaminants like oils, paints, or carbon deposits from GFRP surfaces?
  - answer: Laser treatment at 3.0 J/cm² significantly enhances GFRP adhesion by increasing surface energy and creating micro-roughness. This method outperforms mechanical abrasion by functionalizing the polymer surface without subsurface damage, leading to superior bond strength for composite repairs.
    question: Can laser surface treatment improve adhesion properties of GFRP for repair applications?
  - answer: Complex GFRP geometries present significant beam access and focal plane challenges. Maintaining the critical 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold on curved surfaces is difficult, as stand-off distance variations can cause localized thermal damage or ineffective cleaning. Robotic integration with real-time distance tracking is often essential for uniform energy delivery across intricate contours.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for complex GFRP geometries and curved surfaces?
  - answer: Epoxy resins require higher fluence near 2.5 J/cm² for effective ablation due to their superior thermal stability. In contrast, polyester and vinyl ester matrices decompose more readily, producing styrene and other volatiles, necessitating reduced power below 100W to prevent chemical degradation of the composite surface.
    question: How do different resin systems (epoxy, vinyl ester, polyester) in GFRP respond to laser cleaning?
