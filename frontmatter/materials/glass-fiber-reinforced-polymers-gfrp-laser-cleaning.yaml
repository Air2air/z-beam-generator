caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the GFRP surface appears very-very rough and uneven, with
    contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues clinging tightly to the
    fibers. These contaminants form irregular clusters, blocking matrix interfaces
    and causing discoloration. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and fiber
    pull-outs, so the material looks weakened and porous, then invites further damage
    if not cleaned promptly.
  after: The cleaned surface of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) appears very-very
    smooth and glossy, with contaminants fully removed then original texture restored.
    This process cleans effectively so material integrity remains intact—no delamination
    or fiber damage occurs. Restoration quality is high, as surface looks pristine
    and ready for applications, maintaining composite strength and durability.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk GFRP, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluensi di bawah 2.5 J/cm² untuk
      menghindari ablasi resin. Densitas energi optimal 3.0 J/cm² dan lebar pulsa
      nanodetik mengontrol interaksi material, melindungi serat kaca sambil membersihkan
      kontaminan permukaan secara efektif tanpa merusak matriks komposit.
    question: What laser parameters are safe for cleaning GFRP without damaging the
      glass fibers or resin matrix?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes silicone, wax, and PVA release agents
      from GFRP molds. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at a fluence of 2.5 J/cm² ensures
      contaminant ablation while preserving the mold's dimensional integrity. This
      method maintains surface quality without thermal damage to the composite matrix.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove release agents from GFRP molds without affecting
      the surface quality?
  - answer: Laser cleaning achieves superior surface preparation at 3.0 J/cm², enhancing
      adhesion without the subsurface damage from abrasives. This non-contact process
      with a 100 µm spot size preserves the GFRP's mechanical integrity, unlike grit
      blasting which can weaken the fiber-matrix interface.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to abrasive methods for GFRP surface
      preparation before bonding or painting?
  - answer: Maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² to prevent hazardous fume generation
      from resin decomposition. Use local exhaust ventilation and respiratory protection,
      as thermal degradation releases styrene and formaldehyde exceeding workplace
      exposure limits.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning GFRP due to potential
      hazardous fumes?
  - answer: Dengan parameter optimal seperti fluence 2.5 J/cm² dan scanning 500 mm/s,
      laser cleaning dapat menghilangkan kontaminan tanpa merusak matriks GFRP. Analisis
      mikroskopis mengonfirmasi tidak adanya micro-cracks yang signifikan, sehingga
      integritas struktural material komposit tetap terjaga.
    question: Does laser cleaning create micro-cracks or thermal damage in the GFRP
      matrix that could compromise structural integrity?
  - answer: Near-IR wavelengths around 1064 nm are optimal for GFRP cleaning. This
      provides strong absorption in surface contaminants while the glass fibers remain
      highly transparent, enabling effective removal at ~2.5 J/cm² without damaging
      the composite substrate.
    question: What laser wavelength (UV, IR, etc.) works best for GFRP cleaning and
      why?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes surface contaminants from GFRP using
      a 1064 nm wavelength and fluence near 2.5 J/cm². This selectively ablates oils
      or paints while preserving the underlying composite matrix, verified through
      microscopic inspection for any fiber exposure.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing contaminants like oils,
      paints, or carbon deposits from GFRP surfaces?
  - answer: Laser treatment at 3.0 J/cm² significantly enhances GFRP adhesion by increasing
      surface energy and creating micro-roughness. This method outperforms mechanical
      abrasion by functionalizing the polymer surface without subsurface damage, leading
      to superior bond strength for composite repairs.
    question: Can laser surface treatment improve adhesion properties of GFRP for
      repair applications?
  - answer: Complex GFRP geometries present significant beam access and focal plane
      challenges. Maintaining the critical 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold on curved surfaces
      is difficult, as stand-off distance variations can cause localized thermal damage
      or ineffective cleaning. Robotic integration with real-time distance tracking
      is often essential for uniform energy delivery across intricate contours.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for complex GFRP geometries
      and curved surfaces?
  - answer: Epoxy resins require higher fluence near 2.5 J/cm² for effective ablation
      due to their superior thermal stability. In contrast, polyester and vinyl ester
      matrices decompose more readily, producing styrene and other volatiles, necessitating
      reduced power below 100W to prevent chemical degradation of the composite surface.
    question: How do different resin systems (epoxy, vinyl ester, polyester) in GFRP
      respond to laser cleaning?
