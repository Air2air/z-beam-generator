title: Aluminum Bronze Laser Cleaning
name: Aluminum Bronze
settings_description: When laser cleaning Aluminum Bronze, start with lower power
  settings to handle its moderate light absorption. This alloy cleans smoothly because
  its tough, corrosion-resistant surface sheds contaminants without pitting. You must
  keep pulses short to match its steady heat tolerance. That way, you avoid surface
  warping. Just watch for uneven spots at higher energies—dial back immediately.
