title: Aluminum Bronze Laser Cleaning
name: Aluminum Bronze
settings_description: When laser cleaning Aluminum Bronze, start with lower power
  settings to handle its moderate light absorption. This alloy cleans smoothly because
  its tough, corrosion-resistant surface sheds contaminants without pitting. You must
  keep pulses short to match its steady heat tolerance. That way, you avoid surface
  warping. Just watch for uneven spots at higher energies—dial back immediately.
faq:
- question: How can I effectively clean oxidation from aluminum bronze using a laser?
  answer: We've found that oxidation on aluminum bronze builds up stubbornly because
    of its strong resistance to corrosion, making single passes less effective. You
    need to use multiple short bursts from the laser to gradually lift the layer without
    overheating the base material. In our experience, adjusting the beam to a wider
    focus helps spread the energy and prevents any uneven heating spots.
- question: What settings work best for laser cleaning aluminum bronze parts?
  answer: When laser cleaning aluminum bronze, the main challenge comes from its high
    reflectivity, which bounces much of the laser energy away compared to less shiny
    metals like steel. We typically start with lower power levels and slower scan
    speeds to build up absorption gradually over the surface. This approach ensures
    you remove contaminants like grease or scale while keeping the alloy's durable
    structure intact.
- question: Why does aluminum bronze sometimes warp during laser cleaning?
  answer: Aluminum bronze can warp if the laser heat isn't managed well, especially
    since it conducts heat
