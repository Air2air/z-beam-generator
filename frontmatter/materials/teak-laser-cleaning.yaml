caption:
  before: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 500x magnification shows the teak
    wood surface pretty heavily contaminated with adherent soot particles and organic
    residues. It exhibits severe degradation, including microfissures, delamination
    of the lignocellulosic matrix, and pitting erosion from prolonged environmental
    exposure. Basically, irregular particulates obscure the natural fibrous texture,
    causing widespread discoloration.
  after: Post-laser cleaning optical microscopy at 200x basically reveals the teak
    surface restored to a pretty smooth, uniform condition, featuring intact parenchymal
    cells and vessel elements, with minimal ablation residue and preserved material
    integrity. This demonstrates high restoration quality without thermal damage or
    structural compromise.
faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore the natural beauty of weathered teak furniture?
  answer: Laser cleaning removes dirt, mold, and oxidation layers from teak without
    damaging the wood. It precisely ablates surface contaminants, revealing the golden
    hue and grain, typically in one session lasting 30-60 minutes.
- question: What makes laser cleaning safe for teak's natural oils during restoration?
  answer: Teak's oils are preserved because lasers target only surface impurities
    with controlled energy, avoiding deep penetration. This non-abrasive method prevents
    oil depletion, unlike chemical cleaners that can strip protections.
- question: Why choose laser cleaning over sanding for teak deck maintenance?
  answer: Sanding can remove too much material and alter teak's texture, while laser
    cleaning gently vaporizes grime and old finishes without abrasion. It maintains
    the wood's integrity, reduces labor, and avoids dust hazards, ideal for outdoor
    applications.
- question: Can laser cleaning address teak's insect damage without harsh chemicals?
  answer: Yes, it effectively cleans out insect residues and frass from teak surfaces.
    By precisely removing infested layers, lasers help restore structure while preserving
    natural resistance, often eliminating the need for toxic pesticides in restoration
    projects.
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for preventing teak's graying from UV exposure?
  answer: Absolutely. Laser cleaning strips away the weathered gray patina caused
    by UV rays, exposing fresh wood that can then be sealed. This process revives
    teak's original color and enhances its longevity against future sun damage, with
    results lasting years.
