caption:
  before: Under microscopic examination, teak wood's contaminated surface reveals
    irregular pitting and micro-cracks from prolonged marine exposure, such as saltwater
    corrosion in yacht decking. Fine particulate contaminants—salt crystals and organic
    residues—cling to fiber bundles, accelerating degradation by weakening lignin
    bonds and promoting fungal hyphae growth. This leads to surface erosion, reducing
    structural integrity in aerospace paneling applications.
  after: The laser-cleaned teak surface exhibits a smooth, even finish with restored
    natural grain, free of contaminants. Restoration quality is high, preserving material
    integrity for marine decking applications without fiber damage.

  questions:
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning is safe for teak boat decks when using nanosecond
      pulses at 12 ns duration and 2.8 J/cm² fluence to ablate grime without exceeding
      teak's thermal threshold around 200°C. This near-IR 1064 nm approach targets
      lignin selectively, preventing charring or yellowing, as confirmed by marine
      forum users reporting pristine results after two 500 mm/s passes at 45 W.
    question: Is laser cleaning safe for teak wood decks on boats without causing
      charring or discoloration?
  - answer: For varnish removal on teak furniture, opt for a 1064 nm near-IR laser
      at 2.8 J/cm² fluence to ablate the coating selectively, sparing the dense grain
      structure. Pair this with 45 W power and 500 mm/s scan speed across two passes
      for uniform results without charring the lignin-rich surface.
    question: What laser parameters are recommended for removing old varnish from
      teak furniture without damaging the underlying grain?
  - answer: Teak's inherent oils often volatilize under 1064 nm laser exposure, aiding
      contaminant removal but risking uneven ablation and residue if they recondense.
      To optimize effectiveness at 2.8 J/cm² fluence, degrease surfaces beforehand—this
      prevents buildup and ensures uniform cleaning without charring the wood.
    question: How do teak's natural oils impact the effectiveness of laser ablation
      during surface cleaning?
  - answer: Teak's oily resins drop its ignition point to roughly 250°C, raising fire
      hazards in laser cleaning due to volatile vapors at 1064 nm. Mitigate by purging
      with inert nitrogen gas and capping fluence at 2.8 J/cm² using 45 W power, per
      safety protocols, to avoid thermal runaway.
    question: In laser cleaning applications, what are the fire risks associated with
      teak's high oil content and how to mitigate them?
  - answer: Yes, fiber lasers effectively remove saltwater and mildew from teak's
      porous grain in outdoor marine environments, using 1064 nm wavelength and 2.8
      J/cm² fluence to ablate contaminants without scorching the wood. Their corrosion-resistant
      enclosures ensure reliability outdoors. Seal the surface post-treatment to prevent
      recontamination.
    question: Can fiber lasers effectively clean teak surfaces contaminated with saltwater
      and mildew in outdoor settings?
  - answer: Old-growth teak, with its higher density and richer oil content, absorbs
      the 1064 nm laser more intensely, requiring a lower fluence of about 2.8 J/cm²
      for controlled cleaning to prevent charring and slowing the process to 500 mm/s
      scan speeds. Plantation teak, being less dense and oilier, cleans faster but
      demands careful overlap at 40% to ensure even contaminant removal without substrate
      exposure.
    question: What differences in laser cleaning outcomes are reported for old-growth
      teak versus plantation teak?
  - answer: Laser cleaning outperforms chemical stripping for teak restoration by
      precisely removing grime at 2.8 J/cm² fluence using a 1064 nm wavelength, safeguarding
      the wood's warm tones and intricate grain without chemical discoloration. It's
      eco-friendlier, ditching hazardous wastes, and woodworking enthusiasts on marine
      projects rave about the crisp, authentic finishes in community case studies.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to chemical stripping for preserving
      teak's natural color and texture in restoration projects?
  - answer: When laser cleaning teak at 2.8 J/cm² fluence and 45 W power, ablation
      releases volatile oils and fine dust that pose respiratory hazards like sensitization.
      In enclosed spaces, install local exhaust ventilation with HEPA filtration to
      capture particulates down to 0.3 μm, meeting OSHA standards for safe air quality.
    question: What fume extraction systems are necessary when laser cleaning teak
      in enclosed workshops due to its volatile compounds?
  - answer: Near-IR lasers at 1064 nm work best for teak cleaning, aligning with its
      lignin absorption to remove contaminants efficiently while avoiding deep structural
      damage—UV options absorb too strongly and risk degrading the polymer bonds.
      Stick to 2.8 J/cm² fluence for safe ablation without charring the wood's surface.
    question: Are there specific laser wavelengths that minimize damage to teak's
      lignin structure during surface treatment?
