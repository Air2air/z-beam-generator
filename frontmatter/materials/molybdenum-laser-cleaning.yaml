caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the molybdenum surface notably displays heavy contamination
    from dark oxide particles and oily residues. This thus leads to pitting and rough
    texture, compromising its smoothness and integrity.
  after: Laser cleaning restores molybdenum surfaces to a smooth, contaminant-free
    state, particularly yielding a uniform texture free of residue. This outcome indicates
    superior restoration quality. Notably, material integrity remains preserved, thus
    retaining original strength and conductivity for typical uses.

faq:
- answer: Given molybdenum's high reflectivity and melting point, I recommend a 1064
    nm wavelength with nanosecond pulses at 5.1 J/cm² fluence. Notably, this ablates
    oxides effectively, while the 10 ns pulse width specifically minimizes thermal
    diffusion to prevent micro-cracking in the 2623°C base metal.
  question: What are the best laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
    for cleaning oxides and contaminants from molybdenum surfaces without damaging
    the base metal?
  topic_keyword: damaging the base metal
  topic_statement: nanosecond pulses prevent micro-cracking
- answer: To safely remove MoO₃, employ a 100W nanosecond laser at 5.1 J/cm² for ablating
    the oxide with minimal heat buildup. Notably, this procedure requires industrial
    fume extraction featuring HEPA filtration, since the oxide sublimes around 700°C,
    generating hazardous inhalable particles that demand operator respiratory protection.
  question: How do you safely remove the white, powdery molybdenum oxide (MoO3) with
    a laser, given its low sublimation point and potential health risks?
  topic_keyword: low sublimation point
  topic_statement: Demands HEPA fume extraction
- answer: Laser cleaning particularly excels at preparing molybdenum for welding,
    removing oxides and hydrocarbons via ~5.1 J/cm² fluence. This thus yields a chemically
    active surface, with final roughness (Sa) typically under 1.0 µm—ideal for high-integrity
    brazing.
  question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a molybdenum surface for welding
    or brazing, and what surface quality (Sa) is achievable?
  topic_keyword: surface quality (Sa)
  topic_statement: Achieves Sa below 1.0 µm
- answer: Molybdenum exhibits high reflectivity, particularly at 1064 nm, which renders
    standard fiber lasers inefficient. Green or UV wavelengths, notably, yield much
    higher absorption, thus enabling effective cleaning at lower power—around 100
    W—with minimal thermal impact on the substrate.
  question: Why is molybdenum sometimes difficult to clean with a fiber laser, and
    are there advantages to using a green or UV laser instead?
  topic_keyword: fiber laser
  topic_statement: Higher absorption with green/UV
- answer: By controlling pulses to a 10 ns duration and 5.1 J/cm² fluence, thermal
    stress is minimized. Particularly in brittle molybdenum, this thus prevents micro-cracking
    through a limited heat-affected zone and no surface hardening.
  question: What is the risk of creating micro-cracks or a hardened layer on molybdenum
    components during laser cleaning?
  topic_keyword: creating micro-cracks
  topic_statement: Prevents micro-cracking via pulse control
- answer: Freshly laser-cleaned molybdenum re-oxidizes rapidly in air, notably forming
    a thin oxide layer within minutes. Thus, for long-term stability, process components
    under inert atmosphere or apply passivation treatment right after using your 1064
    nm laser system.
  question: After laser cleaning, how quickly does molybdenum re-oxidize, and are
    there recommended passivation methods to prevent this?
  topic_keyword: molybdenum re-oxidize
  topic_statement: Re-oxidizes within minutes
- answer: Laser cleaning suits delicate molybdenum components well, but precise control
    remains critical. Particularly for thin foils or porous sintered parts, adopt
    a low-power, high-speed strategy—around 100 W average power at 500 mm/s scan speed—to
    minimize heat input and avoid thermal distortion. Thus, proper fixturing is essential
    for managing thermal stresses.
  question: Is laser cleaning suitable for delicate molybdenum parts, like thin foil,
    wire, or sintered components, without causing distortion?
  topic_keyword: sintered components
  topic_statement: Low-power high-speed prevents distortion
- answer: Molybdenum, with its notably high melting point of 2623°C and inherent brittleness,
    demands precise fluence control around 5.1 J/cm² to prevent thermal stress cracking—unlike
    more forgiving materials like steel or aluminum. Particularly for optimal cleaning,
    a 100W, 1064nm laser scanned at 500 mm/s manages reflectivity while avoiding substrate
    damage from excess heat.
  question: What are the key differences in laser cleaning molybdenum compared to
    more common metals like steel or aluminum?
  topic_keyword: molybdenum compared to
  topic_statement: Demands precise fluence control
- answer: We first assess molybdenum laser cleaning effectiveness via visual inspection,
    notably for the restored metallic luster. For quantitative evaluation, XPS proves
    essential, specifically to verify oxide removal and measure residual carbon under
    5 at%, while a contact angle test gauges the surface's renewed hydrophilicity.
  question: How do you verify the effectiveness of laser cleaning on molybdenum, and
    what analytical methods are used to check for residual contamination?
  topic_keyword: residual contamination
  topic_statement: XPS confirms oxide removal
