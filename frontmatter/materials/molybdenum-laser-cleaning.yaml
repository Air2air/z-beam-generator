caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the molybdenum surface notably displays heavy contamination from dark oxide particles and oily residues. This thus leads to pitting and rough texture, compromising its smoothness and integrity.
  after: Laser cleaning restores molybdenum surfaces to a smooth, contaminant-free state, particularly yielding a uniform texture free of residue. This outcome indicates superior restoration quality. Notably, material integrity remains preserved, thus retaining original strength and conductivity for typical uses.

faq:
- question: What are the best laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning oxides and contaminants from molybdenum surfaces without **damaging the base metal**?
  answer: '**nanosecond pulses prevent micro-cracking**. Given molybdenum''s high reflectivity and melting point, I recommend a 1064 nm wavelength with nanosecond pulses at 5.1 J/cm² fluence. Notably, this ablates oxides effectively, while the 10 ns pulse width specifically minimizes thermal diffusion to prevent micro-cracking in the 2623°C base metal.'
- question: How do you safely remove the white, powdery molybdenum oxide (MoO3) with a laser, given its **low sublimation point** and potential health risks?
  answer: '**Demands HEPA fume extraction**. To safely remove MoO₃, employ a 100W nanosecond laser at 5.1 J/cm² for ablating the oxide with minimal heat buildup. Notably, this procedure requires industrial fume extraction featuring HEPA filtration, since the oxide sublimes around 700°C, generating hazardous inhalable particles that demand operator respiratory protection.'
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a molybdenum surface for welding or brazing, and what **surface quality (Sa)** is achievable?
  answer: '**Achieves Sa below 1.0 µm**. Laser cleaning particularly excels at preparing molybdenum for welding, removing oxides and hydrocarbons via ~5.1 J/cm² fluence. This thus yields a chemically active surface, with final roughness (Sa) typically under 1.0 µm—ideal for high-integrity brazing.'
- question: Why is molybdenum sometimes difficult to clean with a **fiber laser**, and are there advantages to using a green or UV laser instead?
  answer: '**Higher absorption with green/UV**. Molybdenum exhibits high reflectivity, particularly at 1064 nm, which renders standard fiber lasers inefficient. Green or UV wavelengths, notably, yield much higher absorption, thus enabling effective cleaning at lower power—around 100 W—with minimal thermal impact on the substrate.'
- question: What is the risk of **creating micro-cracks** or a hardened layer on molybdenum components during laser cleaning?
  answer: '**Prevents micro-cracking via pulse control**. By controlling pulses to a 10 ns duration and 5.1 J/cm² fluence, thermal stress is minimized. Particularly in brittle molybdenum, this thus prevents micro-cracking through a limited heat-affected zone and no surface hardening.'
- question: After laser cleaning, how quickly does **molybdenum re-oxidize**, and are there recommended passivation methods to prevent this?
  answer: '**Re-oxidizes within minutes**. Freshly laser-cleaned molybdenum re-oxidizes rapidly in air, notably forming a thin oxide layer within minutes. Thus, for long-term stability, process components under inert atmosphere or apply passivation treatment right after using your 1064 nm laser system.'
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for delicate molybdenum parts, like thin foil, wire, or **sintered components**, without causing distortion?
  answer: '**Low-power high-speed prevents distortion**. Laser cleaning suits delicate molybdenum components well, but precise control remains critical. Particularly for thin foils or porous sintered parts, adopt a low-power, high-speed strategy—around 100 W average power at 500 mm/s scan speed—to minimize heat input and avoid thermal distortion. Thus, proper fixturing is essential for managing thermal stresses.'
- question: What are the key differences in laser cleaning **molybdenum compared to** more common metals like steel or aluminum?
  answer: '**Demands precise fluence control**. Molybdenum, with its notably high melting point of 2623°C and inherent brittleness, demands precise fluence control around 5.1 J/cm² to prevent thermal stress cracking—unlike more forgiving materials like steel or aluminum. Particularly for optimal cleaning, a 100W, 1064nm laser scanned at 500 mm/s manages reflectivity while avoiding substrate damage from excess heat.'
- question: How do you verify the effectiveness of laser cleaning on molybdenum, and what analytical methods are used to check for **residual contamination**?
  answer: '**XPS confirms oxide removal**. We first assess molybdenum laser cleaning effectiveness via visual inspection, notably for the restored metallic luster. For quantitative evaluation, XPS proves essential, specifically to verify oxide removal and measure residual carbon under 5 at%, while a contact angle test gauges the surface''s renewed hydrophilicity.'
