caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the phenolic resin composite surface displays clustered silica particulates and oily residues,
    fostering microcracks and pitting that erode smoothness. This degradation impairs adhesion in laser housing components,
    underscoring rigorous cleaning for optical reliability.
  after: Cleaning phenolic resin composites restores the surface to a pristine, uniform condition, free from contaminants
    and micro-abrasions. This high-quality restoration preserves full material integrity, ensuring durability in laser system
    enclosures. For general cleaning applications, it supports seamless optical performance without compromising structural
    strength.

  questions:
  - answer: For carbon fiber phenolic composites, use a 1064nm wavelength with approximately 5.1 J/cm² fluence. A 10 ns pulse
      width and 50% beam overlap at 500 mm/s effectively ablates the resin matrix while preserving the underlying fibers.
      This parameter set minimizes thermal damage by leveraging differential absorption between the polymer and carbon reinforcement.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning carbon fiber reinforced
      phenolic composites without damaging the underlying fibers?
  - answer: Laser ablation of phenolic composites at 5.1 J/cm² can decompose the resin matrix, releasing hazardous byproducts
      including formaldehyde. Proper fume extraction is mandatory, and operators must use respiratory protection to mitigate
      exposure risks from these airborne particulates and gases.
    question: Does laser cleaning of phenolic composites create any hazardous byproducts or release formaldehyde?
  - answer: To prevent phenolic resin yellowing, minimize thermal exposure by using our optimal 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 500
      mm/s scan speed. This controlled ablation with a 1064 nm wavelength laser avoids the excessive heat that causes discoloration.
    question: How do I prevent yellowing or discoloration of phenolic resin surfaces during laser cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes carbonized char from phenolic composites using 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1
      J/cm². This fluence selectively ablates the damaged layer while preserving the undamaged substrate beneath, enabling
      precise post-fire restoration.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove carbonized char from phenolic composites after high-temperature exposure
      without damaging the undamaged substrate?
  - answer: For phenolic composites, maintain removal under 25-50 μm to preserve structural integrity. At 5.1 J/cm² fluence,
      monitor depth with optical coherence tomography to prevent damage to the underlying reinforcement fibers. This ensures
      mechanical properties remain uncompromised.
    question: What's the maximum ablation depth we can achieve on phenolic composites before compromising structural integrity?
  - answer: Laser cleaning outperforms traditional methods by precisely ablating coatings at 5.1 J/cm² without damaging the
      composite substrate. This non-contact process eliminates media embedment and hazardous waste, ensuring superior surface
      quality and environmental safety compared to abrasive or chemical techniques.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods like grit blasting or chemical stripping for removing
      coatings from phenolic composites?
  - answer: Woven carbon phenolic presents greater challenges due to its anisotropic structure. The varying resin-to-fiber
      ratio across the weave requires precise fluence control near 5.1 J/cm² to avoid fraying carbon fibers, unlike the more
      uniform molded materials.
    question: What are the challenges with laser cleaning woven carbon phenolic composites versus molded phenolic materials?
  - answer: Yes, laser treatment significantly enhances adhesion on phenolic composites. At 5.1 J/cm², we effectively increase
      surface energy and create micro-roughness for superior mechanical interlocking, outperforming traditional abrasive methods.
    question: Does laser surface treatment improve adhesion for subsequent bonding or painting on phenolic composites?
  - answer: For phenolic composites, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) provides the most precise real-time monitoring.
      It directly analyzes the plasma emission to distinguish between contaminant and the 1064 nm-absorbing resin matrix,
      preventing damage by confirming the endpoint before exceeding the 5.1 J/cm² ablation threshold. This ensures you halt
      the process immediately upon achieving a clean surface.
    question: What real-time monitoring techniques work best for laser cleaning phenolic composites to prevent over-processing?
  - answer: Filler content dramatically alters laser cleaning dynamics. Glass fibers reflect at 1064 nm, requiring higher
      fluence near 5.1 J/cm², while carbon black absorbs aggressively, risking fiber damage. You must adjust parameters like
      the 500 mm/s scan speed based on the composite's specific absorption profile to avoid thermal degradation of the matrix.
    question: How does the filler content (glass fibers, carbon fibers, minerals) in phenolic composites affect laser cleaning
      efficiency and results?
