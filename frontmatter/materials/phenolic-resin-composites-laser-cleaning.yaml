caption:
  before: Under optical microscopy, the phenolic resin composite surface displays
    clustered silica particulates and oily residues, fostering microcracks and pitting
    that erode smoothness. This degradation impairs adhesion in laser housing components,
    underscoring rigorous cleaning for optical reliability.
  after: Cleaning phenolic resin composites restores the surface to a pristine, uniform
    condition, free from contaminants and micro-abrasions. This high-quality restoration
    preserves full material integrity, ensuring durability in laser system enclosures.
    For general cleaning applications, it supports seamless optical performance without
    compromising structural strength.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For carbon fiber phenolic composites, use a 1064nm wavelength with approximately
      5.1 J/cm² fluence. A 10 ns pulse width and 50% beam overlap at 500 mm/s effectively
      ablates the resin matrix while preserving the underlying fibers. This parameter
      set minimizes thermal damage by leveraging differential absorption between the
      polymer and carbon reinforcement.
    question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for cleaning carbon fiber reinforced phenolic composites without damaging the
      underlying fibers?
  - answer: Laser ablation of phenolic composites at 5.1 J/cm² can decompose the resin
      matrix, releasing hazardous byproducts including formaldehyde. Proper fume extraction
      is mandatory, and operators must use respiratory protection to mitigate exposure
      risks from these airborne particulates and gases.
    question: Does laser cleaning of phenolic composites create any hazardous byproducts
      or release formaldehyde?
  - answer: To prevent phenolic resin yellowing, minimize thermal exposure by using
      our optimal 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed. This controlled ablation
      with a 1064 nm wavelength laser avoids the excessive heat that causes discoloration.
    question: How do I prevent yellowing or discoloration of phenolic resin surfaces
      during laser cleaning?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes carbonized char from phenolic
      composites using 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm². This fluence selectively ablates
      the damaged layer while preserving the undamaged substrate beneath, enabling
      precise post-fire restoration.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove carbonized char from phenolic
      composites after high-temperature exposure without damaging the undamaged substrate?
  - answer: For phenolic composites, maintain removal under 25-50 μm to preserve structural
      integrity. At 5.1 J/cm² fluence, monitor depth with optical coherence tomography
      to prevent damage to the underlying reinforcement fibers. This ensures mechanical
      properties remain uncompromised.
    question: What's the maximum ablation depth we can achieve on phenolic composites
      before compromising structural integrity?
  - answer: Laser cleaning outperforms traditional methods by precisely ablating coatings
      at 5.1 J/cm² without damaging the composite substrate. This non-contact process
      eliminates media embedment and hazardous waste, ensuring superior surface quality
      and environmental safety compared to abrasive or chemical techniques.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods like grit blasting
      or chemical stripping for removing coatings from phenolic composites?
  - answer: Woven carbon phenolic presents greater challenges due to its anisotropic
      structure. The varying resin-to-fiber ratio across the weave requires precise
      fluence control near 5.1 J/cm² to avoid fraying carbon fibers, unlike the more
      uniform molded materials.
    question: What are the challenges with laser cleaning woven carbon phenolic composites
      versus molded phenolic materials?
  - answer: Yes, laser treatment significantly enhances adhesion on phenolic composites.
      At 5.1 J/cm², we effectively increase surface energy and create micro-roughness
      for superior mechanical interlocking, outperforming traditional abrasive methods.
    question: Does laser surface treatment improve adhesion for subsequent bonding
      or painting on phenolic composites?
  - answer: For phenolic composites, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) provides
      the most precise real-time monitoring. It directly analyzes the plasma emission
      to distinguish between contaminant and the 1064 nm-absorbing resin matrix, preventing
      damage by confirming the endpoint before exceeding the 5.1 J/cm² ablation threshold.
      This ensures you halt the process immediately upon achieving a clean surface.
    question: What real-time monitoring techniques work best for laser cleaning phenolic
      composites to prevent over-processing?
  - answer: Filler content dramatically alters laser cleaning dynamics. Glass fibers
      reflect at 1064 nm, requiring higher fluence near 5.1 J/cm², while carbon black
      absorbs aggressively, risking fiber damage. You must adjust parameters like
      the 500 mm/s scan speed based on the composite's specific absorption profile
      to avoid thermal degradation of the matrix.
    question: How does the filler content (glass fibers, carbon fibers, minerals)
      in phenolic composites affect laser cleaning efficiency and results?
