faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, contaminants can severely damage stainless steel's surface. They initiate localized corrosion, compromising the material's integrity. Our 1064 nm laser process effectively removes these without harming the base metal.
    question: Can contaminants damage Stainless Steel's surface?
  - answer: Stainless steel is primarily selected for its excellent corrosion resistance, a property derived from its minimum 10.5% chromium content. This ensures long-term structural integrity in demanding environments like aerospace and automotive applications, where material failure is not an option.
    question: Why is Stainless Steel chosen for its main applications?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage stainless steel. Excessive energy density, such as exceeding 5.1 J/cm², may cause surface etching or alter the protective passive layer. Monitor for discoloration, a key warning sign of thermal overload, and always optimize parameters.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage Stainless Steel?
  - answer: Following laser cleaning, immediately apply a protective passivation layer to restore the chromium oxide film. For storage, ensure a dry, contaminant-free environment to prevent corrosion initiation, especially given the material's 1064 nm wavelength affinity which leaves a pristine, active surface.
    question: What care does Stainless Steel need after cleaning?
  - answer: Proper verification combines visual inspection for uniform matte finish with scientific measurement. A surface roughness (Ra) below 1.0 µm, confirmed with a profilometer, indicates successful contaminant removal without damaging the underlying stainless steel substrate. This ensures optimal adhesion for subsequent processes.
    question: How can I verify Stainless Steel was cleaned properly?
  - answer: Stainless steel's high reflectivity, often exceeding 60% at 1064 nm, directly challenges laser cleaning efficiency. This property causes a significant portion of the beam energy to be lost rather than absorbed by the surface contaminants. Therefore, selecting the optimal wavelength and pulse parameters is critical to overcome this reflectivity and ensure effective contaminant removal.
    question: Why does Stainless Steel's reflectivity matter for laser cleaning?
  - answer: The most challenging contaminants are tenacious heat-induced oxides and deeply embedded mill scale. These layers exhibit strong adhesion to the stainless steel substrate, requiring precise laser parameters like a 1064 nm wavelength for effective ablation without compromising the underlying material's corrosion resistance. Their removal complexity is significantly higher than that of superficial oils or paints.
    question: Which contaminants are hardest to remove from Stainless Steel?
  - answer: Stainless steel's high chromium content, vital for its 1064 nm laser absorption, presents a primary challenge. Its tenacious oxide layer requires precise parameter control to avoid surface etching or metallurgical damage. Maintaining this balance is critical for aerospace and automotive components where surface integrity is paramount.
    question: What challenges does Stainless Steel present in use?
  - answer: Laser cleaning stainless steel is safe when proper protocols are followed. The primary hazard is the intense 1064 nm wavelength laser radiation and the resulting particulate plume. Operators must wear appropriate laser safety eyewear and ensure adequate fume extraction to mitigate risks, allowing for a controlled and effective cleaning process.
