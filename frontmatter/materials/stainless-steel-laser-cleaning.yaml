    - When laser cleaning stainless steel, start by adjusting the power to manage
      its natural resistance to oxidation, which preserves surfaces in harsh marine
      or chemical environments. Be sure to avoid overheating that could warp the material,
      while effectively removing contaminants without harming its durable finish.
  - - micro
    - before: At 1000x magnification, the stainless steel surface looks rough and
        uneven before cleaning. Dark spots and tiny debris cling tightly to the metal.
        Scratches and buildup make it seem dull overall.
      after: After laser treatment, the same view shows a smooth and uniform surface.
        The metal gleams with a clean, even shine. No more spots or roughness disrupt
        the finish.

        answer: 'Stainless steel belongs to the metal category and serves widely in
          industrial settings. Engineers often select it for corrosion resistance
          and durability in applications like food processing equipment and structural
          components.


          What physical properties matter for laser cleaning? Stainless steel has
          a specific heat of roughly 500 J/kg·K, which influences how it absorbs laser
          energy. Its thermal destruction point reaches about 1673 K, marking the
          threshold where melting occurs during intense treatments.


          How does laser cleaning work on stainless steel? The process removes contaminants
          such as rust or oxide layers without damaging the base material. A power
          range of 100 W typically suffices for surface preparation. This method restores
          the metal''s original finish and exposes clean substrates for welding or
          coating.


          In industrial use, laser cleaning improves adhesion in subsequent processes.
          It reduces preparation time compared to chemical methods. Workers apply
          short pulses to reveal underlying alloys while maintaining structural integrity.
          Though settings vary by alloy type, these parameters apply to common grades
          like 304 and 316. Overall, the technique proves reliable for maintenance
          tasks.'
