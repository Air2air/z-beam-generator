title: PET Laser Cleaning
name: PET
settings_description: When laser cleaning PET, you must start with the lowest possible
  power settings to avoid quick melting, as this thermoplastic softens much faster
  than sturdier plastics like PVC. Unlike metals that reflect energy and stay cool,
  PET absorbs just enough to heat evenly, so it demands precise control to prevent
  warping. Make sure you use short pulses and keep the beam moving steadily—this clears
  surface grime without damaging the smooth, non-porous base underneath. Watch for
  any yellowing early on, and dial back energy if you see it, because PET's strength
  holds up well under stress but not repeated heat exposure. Adjust scan speed higher
  for thicker buildup to maintain even cleaning.
