title: PET Laser Cleaning
name: PET
settings_description: When laser cleaning PET, you must start with the lowest possible
  power settings to avoid quick melting, as this thermoplastic softens much faster
  than sturdier plastics like PVC. Unlike metals that reflect energy and stay cool,
  PET absorbs just enough to heat evenly, so it demands precise control to prevent
  warping. Make sure you use short pulses and keep the beam moving steadily—this clears
  surface grime without damaging the smooth, non-porous base underneath. Watch for
  any yellowing early on, and dial back energy if you see it, because PET's strength
  holds up well under stress but not repeated heat exposure. Adjust scan speed higher
  for thicker buildup to maintain even cleaning.
faq:
- question: Why does PET sometimes warp during laser cleaning?
  answer: I've seen PET warp more easily than metals because it softens at lower temperatures.
    This happens when the laser heat builds up quickly on its smooth surface, unlike
    tougher materials that handle it better. To avoid this, keep the laser moving
    steadily and use shorter pulses so the material stays intact without deforming.
- question: How do I prepare PET surfaces for effective laser cleaning?
  answer: When cleaning PET, start by removing loose dirt first to let the laser focus
    on the real contaminants. This works best because PET's non-porous nature means
    contaminants stick tight, and prepping helps the laser remove them cleanly without
    residue. I've found wiping with a mild solvent beforehand makes the process faster
    and leaves a spotless finish every time.
- question: What's the best speed for laser cleaning PET to avoid damage?
  answer: Tending to go slow with PET helps control the heat so it cleans without
    burning the edges. Compared to denser plastics, PET's flexibility means it
caption:
  before: When you examine the contaminated PET surface up close, you spot irregular
    patches of grime and tiny debris scattered everywhere. Dust particles cling tightly
    to the uneven texture, making the whole area look dull and cluttered. This buildup
    hides the material's natural smoothness beneath layers of residue.
  after: After laser treatment, you notice the PET surface turns remarkably even and
    clear overall. The grime vanishes completely, leaving behind a polished finish
    without any visible spots. Now the texture appears uniform and bright, ready for
    practical
