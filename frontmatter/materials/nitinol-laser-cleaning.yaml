title: Nitinol Laser Cleaning
name: Nitinol
settings_description: We've found that laser cleaning Nitinol works best when we keep
  the power low and pulse it carefully, because its shape memory effect makes the
  material prone to unexpected deformations under heat. This superelastic nature sets
  it apart from regular metals, so it springs back to form but can warp if you overheat
  during the process. In our experience, start with shorter bursts to remove contaminants
  without triggering phase changes, and watch for surface discoloration mid-job—dial
  back the energy right away to avoid cracking the alloy's tough outer layer. That
  way, you preserve its flexibility and corrosion resistance for medical or aerospace
  uses.
