title: Nitinol Laser Cleaning
name: Nitinol
settings_description: We've found that laser cleaning Nitinol works best when we keep
  the power low and pulse it carefully, because its shape memory effect makes the
  material prone to unexpected deformations under heat. This superelastic nature sets
  it apart from regular metals, so it springs back to form but can warp if you overheat
  during the process. In our experience, start with shorter bursts to remove contaminants
  without triggering phase changes, and watch for surface discoloration mid-job—dial
  back the energy right away to avoid cracking the alloy's tough outer layer. That
  way, you preserve its flexibility and corrosion resistance for medical or aerospace
  uses.
faq:
- question: How can I prevent overheating Nitinol while laser cleaning it?
  answer: When laser cleaning Nitinol, you'll want to use short pulses to avoid overheating
    its sensitive surface. Start with lower power and gradually increase while monitoring
    the temperature closely. This keeps the material's shape memory intact without
    causing distortion.
- question: What causes uneven cleaning on Nitinol wires during laser treatment?
  answer: Make sure you adjust the laser beam evenly across the Nitinol wire's curved
    surface. Uneven spots often come from inconsistent scanning speeds that leave
    some areas under-cleaned. You must scan slowly and overlap passes to get uniform
    removal of contaminants.
- question: Is laser cleaning safe for Nitinol medical implants without residue?
  answer: You should pre-test on scrap pieces to ensure no harmful residues stick
    after cleaning. Nitinol's smooth surface responds well, but always rinse with
    clean water afterward to remove any loose particles. This method preserves its
    corrosion resistance and biocompatibility fully.
