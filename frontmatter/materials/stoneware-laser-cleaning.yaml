caption:
  before: The scanning electron micrograph straightforwardly reveals this surface
    of uncleaned stoneware, covered in dense encrustation of siliceous particulates
    and organic residues. It clearly shows pronounced pitting, microcracks, and glaze
    delamination from prolonged weathering and chemical degradation.
  after: The micrograph after laser cleaning clearly depicts this surface on pristine
    stoneware, with contaminants effectively ablated to reveal homogeneous glaze integrity,
    minimal thermal alteration, and restored microstructural uniformity free of residual
    particulates or induced fractures.
faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning restore stained stoneware without damaging the
    surface?
  answer: Laser cleaning uses precise pulsed lasers to ablate dirt and stains from
    stoneware, vaporizing contaminants at a molecular level while the non-porous clay
    body remains intact, preserving its durability and aesthetic.
- question: What makes stoneware ideal for laser cleaning in restoration projects?
  answer: Stoneware's dense, vitrified structure withstands laser energy without cracking,
    making it perfect for removing grime from antique pieces efficiently.
- question: Can laser cleaning remove heavy buildup from unglazed stoneware safely?
  answer: Yes, it targets organic residues and mineral deposits selectively, avoiding
    absorption issues in unglazed areas and restoring hygiene without chemicals.
- question: Why choose laser cleaning over traditional methods for stoneware tableware?
  answer: Unlike abrasive scrubbing that risks chipping durable yet heavy stoneware,
    laser cleaning is non-contact, eco-friendly, and preserves the non-porous surface
    for food safety, addressing common cracking concerns during restoration.
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for addressing odor retention in stoneware
    crocks?
  answer: Absolutely; the technology eliminates embedded odors by precisely removing
    microscopic residues from the clay's pores, enhancing its value for kitchen use
    without altering the material's heat-resistant properties.
- question: How long does laser cleaning take for a typical stoneware restoration?
  answer: For most items like plates or jugs, the process takes 5-15 minutes per piece,
    depending on stain severity, offering quick results that highlight stoneware's
    rustic appeal while mitigating limitations like staining.
