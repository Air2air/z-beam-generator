title: Polyimide Laser Cleaning
name: Polyimide
settings_description: When laser cleaning Polyimide, you'll want to begin with a low
  pulse energy to gently remove contaminants without risking thermal damage. This
  material's high heat resistance works in your favor, allowing steady progress on
  stubborn residues like oils or particles, but you must monitor the surface closely
  since it absorbs laser energy moderately well and can char if you push too hard.
  Make sure you use short pulses and keep the beam moving to avoid localized heating
  that builds up quickly on its non-porous, tough surface. In my setups, this approach
  restores the smooth finish effectively, preserving the polymer's flexibility and
  strength for electronics or aerospace parts. Watch out midway through for any discoloration—dial
  back the power immediately if it appears, as overheating leads to cracking or brittleness
  that ruins the material's durability. Adjust your scanning speed upward as you go
  to maintain even coverage.
material_description: When laser cleaning polyimide, you must account for its exceptional
  heat resistance that keeps the material stable even under intense thermal stress,
  preventing warping or breakdown that plagues lesser plastics during the process
  so you achieve a clean surface without compromising structural integrity

  before: At 1000x magnification, the polyimide surface looks cluttered with scattered
    dirt particles and sticky residues everywhere. I've seen how these contaminants
    form uneven clumps that roughen the entire area. They hide the material's base
    texture under a dull, patchy layer.
  after: After laser treatment at 1000x, the polyimide surface appears smooth and
    free of all visible debris now. I've noticed the treatment restores a uniform,
    glossy finish across every spot. No residues remain to mar the clean, even
