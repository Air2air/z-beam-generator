caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the iron surface appears very-very rough and degraded,
    with deep-deep pits and cracks formed by corrosion. Contaminants, including rust
    oxides and sticky oil residues, cluster and cover the metal, blocking natural
    shine. Surface is weakened so, degradation spreads then makes material brittle
    over time.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the iron surface appears very-very smooth
    and shiny, with dirt and rust removed completely then polished gently. Restoration
    quality is excellent, as the process cleans without heating deeply, so material
    integrity stays strong—no cracks or weakening occur. The metal looks restored
    to original condition, ready for general use and applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For rust removal from iron, nanosecond pulses at 1064nm wavelength are
      optimal. A fluence around 5.1 J/cm² effectively ablates oxides while a 50% overlap
      prevents heat buildup that could alter the base metal's microstructure. This
      approach ensures selective removal without substrate damage.
    question: What are the best laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration)
      for removing rust from iron without damaging the base metal?
  - answer: The dark blue or black layer is a thin magnetite (Fe₃O₄) passivation film
      formed by residual heat. This is protective but often undesirable. To prevent
      it, increase your scan speed above 500 mm/s or use an argon assist gas, as this
      minimizes thermal input and avoids oxide reformation on the freshly cleaned
      iron surface.
    question: After laser cleaning iron, why does a dark, sometimes blue or black,
      oxide layer sometimes appear?
  - answer: Laser cleaning typically reduces iron's surface roughness to 1-2 µm Ra,
      creating a more uniform profile than abrasive blasting. At 5.1 J/cm², we can
      precisely tailor the anchor pattern for coating adhesion, while higher scan
      speeds can yield a micro-polishing effect.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface roughness and profile of
      iron substrates?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes tenacious mill scale from rolled steel.
      Using high peak power pulses around 100 W at 1064 nm wavelength induces differential
      ablation, spalling the oxide layer. Multiple passes are often required to ensure
      complete removal without substrate damage.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing mill scale from rolled steel,
      and what are the challenges?
  - answer: Laser cleaning iron at 1064 nm generates hazardous iron oxide nanoparticles
      and potential heavy metal fumes. Using a 100 W system requires robust HEPA filtration
      and respiratory PPE to prevent metal fume fever from sub-micron particulates.
    question: What are the specific safety hazards when laser cleaning iron, especially
      concerning fumes and particulates?
  - answer: Laser cleaning presents minimal hydrogen embrittlement risk for high-strength
      iron alloys, unlike acid pickling. The thermal ablation process at 5.1 J/cm²
      fluence effectively removes oxides without introducing hydrogen, provided excessive
      power is avoided to prevent surface melting and contaminant entrapment.
    question: Can laser cleaning induce hydrogen embrittlement in high-strength iron
      alloys?
  - answer: We verify iron cleanliness using visual contrast and adhesion tape tests,
      referencing ISO 8501-1. The process, using a 1064 nm wavelength and 5.1 J/cm²
      fluence, effectively removes oxides while preserving the substrate for subsequent
      treatments.
    question: How do you verify the cleanliness of an iron surface after laser cleaning,
      and what standards apply?
  - answer: Cast iron contains graphite flakes that absorb the 1064 nm wavelength
      poorly. The laser selectively ablates the surrounding iron matrix, leaving a
      porous, graphite-rich surface that appears dark. To minimize this smutty residue,
      adjust parameters like the fluence above 5.1 J/cm² to ensure more uniform removal
      of both phases.
    question: Why is cast iron sometimes more difficult to laser clean than mild steel?
  - answer: Thermal stress from rapid heating cycles poses the main micro-crack risk,
      particularly in hardened steels. To mitigate this, we recommend nanosecond pulses
      at 10 ns and a controlled 50% overlap ratio. This prevents excessive heat accumulation,
      keeping the process below the material's stress threshold.
    question: What is the risk of creating micro-cracks on the surface of iron components
      during laser cleaning?
