title: Iron Laser Cleaning
subtitle: Iron's 1811 K melting point suits laser cleaning, needing 0.75 J/cm² to

description: 'Iron stands out among metals for laser cleaning because of its solid
  thermal conductivity—it spreads heat quickly, which helps prevent localized overheating
  and warping during the process. This property lets you work faster on large surfaces
  without risking cracks, so keep scan speeds around 500 mm/s to take full advantage.
  Start with a power of about 100 W and an energy density of 5 J/cm²; that clears
  rust and scale effectively while keeping the base material intact.


  What sets iron apart is its moderate reflectivity, around 60%, which means it bounces
  back more laser energy than something like aluminum. To handle this, boost the number
  of passes to two or three, with 50% overlap between scans, so contaminants absorb
  the light first and loosen up. Unlike non-ferrous metals, iron''s low porosity—basically
  zero—ensures a smooth finish after cleaning, but it also makes it prone to re-oxidation
  if you expose fresh surfaces to air too long. Always follow up with a protective
  coating right away.


  Watch for its decent thermal shock resistance, about 80°C, which is unusual for
  a heavy industrial metal; it tolerates quick temperature swings better than you
  might expect. This lets you use short pulses of 10 ns without much distortion, ideal
  for automotive or rail parts. But a key pitfall is pushing past the ablation threshold
  of 1.5 J/cm²—too much energy vaporizes the surface unevenly, leaving pits. Dial
  back the repetition rate to 50 kHz if you see uneven removal, and test on a scrap
  piece first to fine-tune.


  Iron''s high density and strength make it forgiving for restoration work, like in
  cultural heritage or marine engineering, where you need to strip decades of corrosion
  without weakening the structure. Avoid high spot sizes over 50 μm, though, as they
  can scatter heat and dull the edges on precision jobs. In my experience from heavy
  manufacturing setups, these adjustments restore iron''s natural luster reliably,
  saving time on post-processing.'
