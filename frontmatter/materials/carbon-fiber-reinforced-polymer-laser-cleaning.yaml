caption:
  before: Microscopy reveals the CFRP surface covered in fine dust particles and oily
    residues, which adhere unevenly to exposed fibers and matrix. This contamination
    causes minor pitting and early fiber delamination, signaling surface degradation.
  after: The cleaned surface of carbon fiber reinforced polymer appears smooth and
    uniform, restoring its original texture without fiber damage. This demonstrates
    maintained structural integrity and strength for reliable applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For CFRP laser cleaning, near-IR at 1064nm is generally preferred over
      UV. It provides superior absorption by carbon contaminants while minimizing
      resin damage, especially at a fluence around 5 J/cm². This wavelength effectively
      ablates surface layers without compromising the underlying fiber integrity.
    question: What laser wavelength is most effective for cleaning CFRP without damaging
      the fibers or resin?
  - answer: For CFRP surface preparation, employ nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with
      a fluence of 5 J/cm². This wavelength is selectively absorbed by contaminants
      like silicone, enabling their clean removal while preserving the underlying
      epoxy matrix. A scanning speed of 500 mm/s with 50% overlap prevents thermal
      damage to the fiber-matrix interface.
    question: How do I remove release agents and mold residues from CFRP surfaces
      without compromising structural integrity?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively activates CFRP surfaces using 1064 nm wavelength
      at 5 J/cm² fluence. This removes contaminants while optimizing surface roughness,
      achieving bond strength comparable to grit blasting without mechanical damage
      to the composite fibers.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively prepare CFRP surfaces for bonding and
      repair without mechanical abrasion?
  - answer: Laser cleaning CFRP at 1064 nm generates toxic hydrogen cyanide and benzene
      fumes. Proper fume extraction is mandatory, and operators require supplied-air
      respirators. The 5 J/cm² fluence threshold must be strictly observed to minimize
      hazardous byproduct generation.
    question: What are the safety concerns when laser cleaning CFRP, particularly
      regarding toxic fume generation?
  - answer: Use ultrashort pulses below 10 ps to minimize heat diffusion into the
      epoxy matrix. Maintain fluence near 5 J/cm² with 50 μm spot size for selective
      contaminant removal. Real-time thermal monitoring prevents exceeding the matrix
      degradation threshold.
    question: How do I prevent thermal damage to the epoxy matrix when laser cleaning
      CFRP composites?
  - answer: For CFRP paint removal, use 1064nm wavelength with fluence below 5 J/cm².
      Employ multiple passes at 500 mm/s with 50% overlap to selectively ablate coatings
      while preserving the underlying resin matrix for subsequent recoating.
    question: What laser parameters work best for removing paint and coatings from
      CFRP without fiber exposure?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence chemically functionalizes CFRP surfaces
      by generating oxygen-containing groups. This increases surface energy and enhances
      wettability, significantly improving adhesion promotion for subsequent bonding
      or coating processes. The 1064 nm wavelength ensures minimal matrix damage.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface chemistry and wettability
      of CFRP for subsequent processing?
  - answer: Maintaining consistent 5 J/cm² fluence on curved CFRP surfaces requires
      precise robotic path planning. Complex geometries challenge stand-off distance
      control, risking thermal damage from defocused beams. Beam delivery systems
      must adapt to contoured parts while ensuring uniform energy distribution.
    question: What are the challenges with automated laser cleaning of complex CFRP
      geometries and curved surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² can reveal BVID through surface morphology changes,
      but cannot directly detect subsurface delamination. LIBS identifies contaminants
      during processing, yet internal fiber damage assessment requires complementary
      NDI methods due to CFRP's opacity.
    question: Can laser cleaning detect and remove barely visible impact damage (BVID)
      in CFRP while cleaning?
  - answer: Fiber orientation critically affects thermal conduction, requiring parameter
      adjustments. Unidirectional composites demand lower fluence near 5 J/cm² along
      fibers, while woven patterns need careful beam overlap to address resin pocket
      ablation differences.
    question: How does carbon fiber orientation and weave pattern affect laser cleaning
      results and parameter selection?
  - answer: For CFRP laser cleaning verification, we employ contact angle measurements
      to confirm surface energy increase and optical profilometry to validate sub-micron
      roughness. At 5 J/cm² fluence, successful cleaning yields 30-50% adhesion improvement
      in pull-tests, while thermography detects subsurface thermal damage non-destructively.
    question: What quality control methods are most effective for verifying successful
      laser cleaning of CFRP?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior cost efficiency for CFRP maintenance, operating
      at 100W with 5 J/cm² fluence to selectively remove contaminants without damaging
      the composite matrix. This method eliminates expensive consumables and hazardous
      waste disposal, significantly reducing operational expenses compared to traditional
      abrasive or chemical approaches in aerospace applications.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (grit blasting,
      chemical stripping) for CFRP in terms of cost and performance?
