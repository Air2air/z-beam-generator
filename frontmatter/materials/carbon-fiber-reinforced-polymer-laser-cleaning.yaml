caption:
  before: Microscopy reveals the CFRP surface covered in fine dust particles and oily residues, which adhere unevenly to exposed fibers and matrix. This contamination causes minor pitting and early fiber delamination, signaling surface degradation.
  after: The cleaned surface of carbon fiber reinforced polymer appears smooth and uniform, restoring its original texture without fiber damage. This demonstrates maintained structural integrity and strength for reliable applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For CFRP laser cleaning, near-IR at 1064nm is generally preferred over UV. It provides superior absorption by carbon contaminants while minimizing resin damage, especially at a fluence around 5 J/cm². This wavelength effectively ablates surface layers without compromising the underlying fiber integrity.
    question: What laser wavelength is most effective for cleaning CFRP without damaging the fibers or resin?
  - answer: For CFRP surface preparation, employ nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm with a fluence of 5 J/cm². This wavelength is selectively absorbed by contaminants like silicone, enabling their clean removal while preserving the underlying epoxy matrix. A scanning speed of 500 mm/s with 50% overlap prevents thermal damage to the fiber-matrix interface.
    question: How do I remove release agents and mold residues from CFRP surfaces without compromising structural integrity?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively activates CFRP surfaces using 1064 nm wavelength at 5 J/cm² fluence. This removes contaminants while optimizing surface roughness, achieving bond strength comparable to grit blasting without mechanical damage to the composite fibers.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively prepare CFRP surfaces for bonding and repair without mechanical abrasion?
  - answer: Laser cleaning CFRP at 1064 nm generates toxic hydrogen cyanide and benzene fumes. Proper fume extraction is mandatory, and operators require supplied-air respirators. The 5 J/cm² fluence threshold must be strictly observed to minimize hazardous byproduct generation.
    question: What are the safety concerns when laser cleaning CFRP, particularly regarding toxic fume generation?
  - answer: Use ultrashort pulses below 10 ps to minimize heat diffusion into the epoxy matrix. Maintain fluence near 5 J/cm² with 50 μm spot size for selective contaminant removal. Real-time thermal monitoring prevents exceeding the matrix degradation threshold.
    question: How do I prevent thermal damage to the epoxy matrix when laser cleaning CFRP composites?
  - answer: For CFRP paint removal, use 1064nm wavelength with fluence below 5 J/cm². Employ multiple passes at 500 mm/s with 50% overlap to selectively ablate coatings while preserving the underlying resin matrix for subsequent recoating.
    question: What laser parameters work best for removing paint and coatings from CFRP without fiber exposure?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence chemically functionalizes CFRP surfaces by generating oxygen-containing groups. This increases surface energy and enhances wettability, significantly improving adhesion promotion for subsequent bonding or coating processes. The 1064 nm wavelength ensures minimal matrix damage.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface chemistry and wettability of CFRP for subsequent processing?
  - answer: Maintaining consistent 5 J/cm² fluence on curved CFRP surfaces requires precise robotic path planning. Complex geometries challenge stand-off distance control, risking thermal damage from defocused beams. Beam delivery systems must adapt to contoured parts while ensuring uniform energy distribution.
    question: What are the challenges with automated laser cleaning of complex CFRP geometries and curved surfaces?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² can reveal BVID through surface morphology changes, but cannot directly detect subsurface delamination. LIBS identifies contaminants during processing, yet internal fiber damage assessment requires complementary NDI methods due to CFRP's opacity.
    question: Can laser cleaning detect and remove barely visible impact damage (BVID) in CFRP while cleaning?
  - answer: Fiber orientation critically affects thermal conduction, requiring parameter adjustments. Unidirectional composites demand lower fluence near 5 J/cm² along fibers, while woven patterns need careful beam overlap to address resin pocket ablation differences.
    question: How does carbon fiber orientation and weave pattern affect laser cleaning results and parameter selection?
  - answer: For CFRP laser cleaning verification, we employ contact angle measurements to confirm surface energy increase and optical profilometry to validate sub-micron roughness. At 5 J/cm² fluence, successful cleaning yields 30-50% adhesion improvement in pull-tests, while thermography detects subsurface thermal damage non-destructively.
    question: What quality control methods are most effective for verifying successful laser cleaning of CFRP?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior cost efficiency for CFRP maintenance, operating at 100W with 5 J/cm² fluence to selectively remove contaminants without damaging the composite matrix. This method eliminates expensive consumables and hazardous waste disposal, significantly reducing operational expenses compared to traditional abrasive or chemical approaches in aerospace applications.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (grit blasting, chemical stripping) for CFRP in terms of cost and performance?
