caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the CFRP surface shows coverage by fine dust particles
    and oily residues, adhering unevenly to exposed fibers and matrix. Notably, this
    contamination induces minor pitting and early fiber delamination, thus indicating
    surface degradation.
  after: The cleaned surface of carbon fiber reinforced polymer looks smooth and uniform,
    particularly restoring its original texture without fiber damage. Notably, this
    indicates preserved structural integrity and strength for dependable applications.

faq:
- answer: For CFRP laser cleaning, near-IR at 1064 nm is generally preferred over
    UV, particularly due to its superior absorption by carbon contaminants while minimizing
    resin damage at fluences around 5 J/cm². Thus, this wavelength ablates surface
    layers effectively without compromising underlying fiber integrity.
  question: What laser wavelength is most effective for cleaning CFRP without damaging
    the fibers or resin?
- answer: For CFRP surface preparation, use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm and a fluence
    of 5 J/cm². Specifically, this wavelength gets absorbed by contaminants such as
    silicone, allowing their removal without harming the epoxy matrix underneath.
    Thus, scanning at 500 mm/s with 50% overlap avoids thermal damage to the fiber-matrix
    interface.
  question: How do I remove release agents and mold residues from CFRP surfaces without
    compromising structural integrity?
  topic_keyword: structural integrity
  topic_statement: Preserves fiber-matrix interface
- answer: Laser cleaning, particularly at 5 J/cm² fluence with 1064 nm wavelength,
    effectively activates CFRP surfaces. Notably, it removes contaminants and optimizes
    surface roughness, thus achieving bond strength akin to grit blasting without
    harming composite fibers.
  question: Can laser cleaning effectively prepare CFRP surfaces for bonding and repair
    without mechanical abrasion?
  topic_keyword: without mechanical abrasion
  topic_statement: Activates surfaces without fiber damage
- answer: Laser cleaning of CFRP at 1064 nm produces toxic hydrogen cyanide and benzene
    fumes, particularly endangering health. Proper fume extraction remains essential,
    with operators specifically needing supplied-air respirators. Thus, strictly adhere
    to the 5 J/cm² fluence threshold to reduce hazardous byproducts.
  question: What are the safety concerns when laser cleaning CFRP, particularly regarding
    toxic fume generation?
  topic_keyword: toxic fume generation
  topic_statement: Generates HCN and benzene fumes
- answer: Employ ultrashort pulses under 10 ps, particularly to curb heat diffusion
    into the epoxy matrix. Target fluence around 5 J/cm² via a 50 μm spot size for
    precise contaminant removal. Thus, real-time thermal monitoring avoids surpassing
    the matrix degradation threshold.
  question: How do I prevent thermal damage to the epoxy matrix when laser cleaning
    CFRP composites?
  topic_keyword: epoxy matrix
  topic_statement: ultrashort pulses minimize heat diffusion
- answer: For CFRP paint removal, particularly employ a 1064 nm wavelength with fluence
    under 5 J/cm². Thus, apply multiple passes at 500 mm/s using 50% overlap to selectively
    ablate coatings, while safeguarding the underlying resin matrix for later recoating.
  question: What laser parameters work best for removing paint and coatings from CFRP
    without fiber exposure?
  topic_keyword: without fiber exposure
  topic_statement: Preserves underlying resin matrix
- answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence chemically functionalizes CFRP surfaces,
    notably by generating oxygen-containing groups. Thus, it boosts surface energy
    and wettability, markedly aiding adhesion in later bonding or coating steps. The
    1064 nm wavelength specifically minimizes matrix damage.
  question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface chemistry and wettability of
    CFRP for subsequent processing?
  topic_keyword: surface chemistry and wettability
  topic_statement: Functionalizes surfaces enhancing adhesion
- answer: Achieving consistent 5 J/cm² fluence on curved CFRP surfaces demands precise
    robotic path planning. Particularly, complex geometries hinder stand-off distance
    control, potentially causing thermal damage from defocused beams. Thus, beam delivery
    systems should adapt to contoured parts for uniform energy distribution.
  question: What are the challenges with automated laser cleaning of complex CFRP
    geometries and curved surfaces?
  topic_keyword: complex CFRP geometries
  topic_statement: Requires precise robotic path planning
- answer: Notably, laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² reveals BVID via surface morphology changes,
    though it cannot directly detect subsurface delamination. LIBS specifically identifies
    contaminants during processing, yet internal fiber damage assessment thus requires
    complementary NDI methods owing to CFRP's opacity.
  question: Can laser cleaning detect and remove barely visible impact damage (BVID)
    in CFRP while cleaning?
  topic_keyword: barely visible impact damage
  topic_statement: Requires complementary NDI for subsurface
- answer: Fiber orientation notably influences thermal conduction, thus necessitating
    parameter tweaks. Unidirectional composites, particularly along the fibers, require
    lower fluence around 5 J/cm², whereas woven patterns demand precise beam overlap
    to manage variations in resin pocket ablation.
  question: How does carbon fiber orientation and weave pattern affect laser cleaning
    results and parameter selection?
  topic_keyword: fiber orientation
  topic_statement: Affects thermal conduction adjustments
- answer: For CFRP laser cleaning verification, we particularly rely on contact angle
    measurements to confirm surface energy increases, alongside optical profilometry
    for validating sub-micron roughness. At 5 J/cm² fluence, successful cleaning thus
    delivers 30-50% adhesion gains in pull-tests, while thermography enables non-destructive
    subsurface thermal damage detection.
  question: What quality control methods are most effective for verifying successful
    laser cleaning of CFRP?
- answer: Laser cleaning delivers superior cost efficiency, particularly for CFRP
    maintenance in aerospace settings. Operating at 100W with 5 J/cm² fluence, it
    selectively removes contaminants without harming the composite matrix. Notably,
    this eliminates pricey consumables and hazardous waste, thus cutting operational
    costs far below those of traditional abrasive or chemical methods.
  question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (grit blasting,
    chemical stripping) for CFRP in terms of cost and performance?
