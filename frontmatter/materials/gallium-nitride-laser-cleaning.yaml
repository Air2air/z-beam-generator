title: Gallium Nitride Laser Cleaning
name: Gallium Nitride
settings_description: When laser cleaning Gallium Nitride, the biggest challenge we've
  found is its brittleness compared to softer semiconductors like silicon. This sets
  it apart because it cracks easily under uneven heating, unlike more forgiving materials.
  So we typically use short pulses and gentle power levels to remove contaminants
  without stressing the surface. We've seen this approach restore clean finishes reliably.
  Just watch for any micro-fractures at the end—adjust scans if needed to avoid them.
material_description: The biggest hurdle in high-power electronics often comes from
  materials failing under extreme heat, but Gallium Nitride overcomes this with its
  outstanding thermal endurance that lets devices operate reliably where others simply
  can't, so watch for overheating risks during processing to preserve its edge.
caption:
  before: Under the microscope at high magnification, the contaminated Gallium Nitride
    surface reveals scattered dark spots and irregular clumps. These debris clusters
    cling tightly, creating uneven patches across the material. Dust and residues
    obscure the underlying structure, making the texture look rough and mottled.
  after: After laser treatment, the same view shows a smooth, uniform Gallium Nitride
    surface free of debris. The material now gleams evenly, with no visible spots
    or clumps remaining. Its clean texture appears polished and consistent throughout.
