caption:
  before: Microscopy reveals the polycarbonate surface contaminated with fine dust particles and oily residues. This surface, it shows light degradation through micro-scratches and hazy patches, reducing smoothness and optical clarity.
  after: After cleaning the polycarbonate surface, it regains its smooth, glossy finish without any visible residues. This plastic material shows restored clarity and even texture, free from haze or spots. The process preserves integrity, with no thermal stress or micro-cracks that could weaken its impact resistance. Restoration quality proves reliable, maintaining optical properties and durability for everyday uses like protective covers and displays.

  questions:
  - answer: Yes, polycarbonate can be safely laser cleaned without yellowing by using a 1064 nm wavelength and carefully controlled fluence below 0.8 J/cm². This approach removes contaminants while keeping the substrate temperature well below its thermal degradation threshold, preventing photochemical damage and preserving optical clarity.
    question: Can you safely laser clean polycarbonate surfaces without causing yellowing or clouding?
  - answer: For polycarbonate cleaning, near-IR wavelengths like 1064 nm are safest, as they are poorly absorbed by the substrate, minimizing thermal damage. Maintain a fluence below 0.8 J/cm² and use nanosecond pulses at 20 kHz. This effectively removes contaminants while preserving the polymer's integrity.
    question: What laser wavelength is safest for cleaning contaminants from polycarbonate without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: For silicone-based mold releases on polycarbonate, we use a 1064 nm laser at ~0.8 J/cm² fluence. This effectively ablates the thin organic film while keeping the substrate's temperature safely below its damage threshold, ensuring complete removal.
    question: How do you remove mold release agents from polycarbonate components using laser cleaning?
  - answer: For polycarbonate laser cleaning, maintain fluence below 1.0 J/cm² to prevent melting. Optimal results are typically achieved around 0.8 J/cm² using a 1064 nm wavelength, which effectively removes contaminants while preserving the polymer's integrity.
    question: What are the maximum safe fluence levels for laser cleaning polycarbonate surfaces?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can induce micro-cracks in polycarbonate due to its notch sensitivity. To prevent this, maintain fluence below 0.8 J/cm² and use a 50% overlap ratio to avoid excessive thermal stress that degrades mechanical properties.
    question: Can laser cleaning create micro-cracks or stress concentrations in polycarbonate components?
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning preserves polycarbonate optics by using gentle parameters like 0.8 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed. This approach removes contaminants while minimizing surface roughness and haze formation, thus maintaining high light transmission.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the optical clarity and light transmission of polycarbonate lenses or windows?
  - answer: Polycarbonate decomposition releases bisphenol A and phenolic compounds. Use a high-efficiency fume extractor with HEPA/activated carbon filtration, maintaining the laser fluence below 0.8 J/cm² to minimize hazardous fume generation. Proper ventilation is non-negotiable for operator safety.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning polycarbonate due to potential hazardous fume generation?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares polycarbonate for adhesion by increasing surface energy and creating micro-textures. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 0.8 J/cm² fluence removes contaminants while modifying the surface chemistry, outperforming traditional solvent wiping for bond strength.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for preparing polycarbonate surfaces for adhesion or coating applications?
  - answer: For aged polycarbonate, we use a 1064 nm laser with fluence carefully controlled below 0.8 J/cm². This selectively ablates the degraded surface layer while preserving the undamaged substrate beneath. The process restores optical clarity and surface integrity without thermal damage.
    question: How do you remove oxidation or UV degradation from aged polycarbonate using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser-induced fluorescence monitoring effectively detects early polycarbonate degradation by tracking spectral shifts around 450-550 nm, signaling molecular breakdown before visible damage. Simultaneously, thermal imaging maintains surface temperature below 150°C, ensuring the process stays within the safe fluence threshold of 0.8 J/cm² for this sensitive polymer.
    question: What real-time monitoring techniques work best for laser cleaning polycarbonate to prevent damage?
