caption:
  before: Microscopy reveals the polycarbonate surface contaminated with fine dust
    particles and oily residues. This surface, it shows light degradation through
    micro-scratches and hazy patches, reducing smoothness and optical clarity.
  after: After cleaning the polycarbonate surface, it regains its smooth, glossy finish
    without any visible residues. This plastic material shows restored clarity and
    even texture, free from haze or spots. The process preserves integrity, with no
    thermal stress or micro-cracks that could weaken its impact resistance. Restoration
    quality proves reliable, maintaining optical properties and durability for everyday
    uses like protective covers and displays.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, polycarbonate can be safely laser cleaned without yellowing by using
      a 1064 nm wavelength and carefully controlled fluence below 0.8 J/cm². This
      approach removes contaminants while keeping the substrate temperature well below
      its thermal degradation threshold, preventing photochemical damage and preserving
      optical clarity.
    question: Can you safely laser clean polycarbonate surfaces without causing yellowing
      or clouding?
  - answer: For polycarbonate cleaning, near-IR wavelengths like 1064 nm are safest,
      as they are poorly absorbed by the substrate, minimizing thermal damage. Maintain
      a fluence below 0.8 J/cm² and use nanosecond pulses at 20 kHz. This effectively
      removes contaminants while preserving the polymer's integrity.
    question: What laser wavelength is safest for cleaning contaminants from polycarbonate
      without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: For silicone-based mold releases on polycarbonate, we use a 1064 nm laser
      at ~0.8 J/cm² fluence. This effectively ablates the thin organic film while
      keeping the substrate's temperature safely below its damage threshold, ensuring
      complete removal.
    question: How do you remove mold release agents from polycarbonate components
      using laser cleaning?
  - answer: For polycarbonate laser cleaning, maintain fluence below 1.0 J/cm² to
      prevent melting. Optimal results are typically achieved around 0.8 J/cm² using
      a 1064 nm wavelength, which effectively removes contaminants while preserving
      the polymer's integrity.
    question: What are the maximum safe fluence levels for laser cleaning polycarbonate
      surfaces?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can induce micro-cracks in polycarbonate due to its
      notch sensitivity. To prevent this, maintain fluence below 0.8 J/cm² and use
      a 50% overlap ratio to avoid excessive thermal stress that degrades mechanical
      properties.
    question: Can laser cleaning create micro-cracks or stress concentrations in polycarbonate
      components?
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning preserves polycarbonate optics by using gentle parameters
      like 0.8 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed. This approach removes contaminants
      while minimizing surface roughness and haze formation, thus maintaining high
      light transmission.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect the optical clarity and light transmission
      of polycarbonate lenses or windows?
  - answer: Polycarbonate decomposition releases bisphenol A and phenolic compounds.
      Use a high-efficiency fume extractor with HEPA/activated carbon filtration,
      maintaining the laser fluence below 0.8 J/cm² to minimize hazardous fume generation.
      Proper ventilation is non-negotiable for operator safety.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning polycarbonate
      due to potential hazardous fume generation?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares polycarbonate for adhesion by increasing
      surface energy and creating micro-textures. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 0.8
      J/cm² fluence removes contaminants while modifying the surface chemistry, outperforming
      traditional solvent wiping for bond strength.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for preparing polycarbonate surfaces for
      adhesion or coating applications?
  - answer: For aged polycarbonate, we use a 1064 nm laser with fluence carefully
      controlled below 0.8 J/cm². This selectively ablates the degraded surface layer
      while preserving the undamaged substrate beneath. The process restores optical
      clarity and surface integrity without thermal damage.
    question: How do you remove oxidation or UV degradation from aged polycarbonate
      using laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser-induced fluorescence monitoring effectively detects early polycarbonate
      degradation by tracking spectral shifts around 450-550 nm, signaling molecular
      breakdown before visible damage. Simultaneously, thermal imaging maintains surface
      temperature below 150°C, ensuring the process stays within the safe fluence
      threshold of 0.8 J/cm² for this sensitive polymer.
    question: What real-time monitoring techniques work best for laser cleaning polycarbonate
      to prevent damage?
