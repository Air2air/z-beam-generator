caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the fiberglass surface notably displays contaminants,
    such as fine dust particles and oily residues embedded among the fibers. This
    accumulation thus causes surface degradation, featuring visible pitting and minor
    fiber fraying.
  after: After laser cleaning, the fiberglass surface notably appears smooth and evenly
    restored to its original luster. No fiber damage or delamination is evident, thus
    preserving the composite's integrity effectively while retaining full strength
    for ongoing applications.

faq:
- answer: Laser cleaning is strongly discouraged for fiberglass composites, particularly
    since the polymer resin absorbs near-infrared energy at 1064 nm so readily. This
    leads to thermal degradation. Notably, even at a conservative fluence of 5 J/cm²,
    the resin matrix can burn and vaporize, thus catastrophically compromising the
    material's structural integrity.
  question: Can you safely use a laser cleaner to remove paint or contamination from
    a fiberglass surface?
  topic_keyword: fiberglass surface
  topic_statement: Polymer resin thermal degradation
- answer: The 1064 nm laser energy gets strongly absorbed by the polymer resin, particularly
    triggering rapid thermal decomposition and ablation at fluences around 5 J/cm².
    This leaves exposed, frayed glass fibers and a charred surface behind, thus critically
    undermining the material's structural integrity. The composite simply isn't suited
    for this cleaning method.
  question: What happens to fiberglass when it's hit with a laser during cleaning?
  topic_keyword: hit with a laser
  topic_statement: Causes thermal decomposition ablation
- answer: UV lasers at 5 J/cm² particularly minimize thermal effects, yet fiberglass
    proves highly vulnerable. Even under optimized ns-pulse settings, the resin matrix
    remains prone to degradation. Thus, most industrial systems face material damage
    risks, deeming this application largely unsuitable.
  question: Are there any specific laser types or settings (wavelength, power) that
    make cleaning fiberglass less destructive?
  topic_keyword: less destructive
  topic_statement: resin matrix degrades
- answer: Particularly for fiberglass restoration, gentle mechanical abrasion using
    plastic media or chemical stripping is preferred. These approaches notably avoid
    the thermal risks of laser processing, which requires precise control below 5
    J/cm² to prevent resin degradation in the composite matrix.
  question: What is the best alternative to laser cleaning for preparing or restoring
    fiberglass surfaces?
  topic_keyword: restoring fiberglass surfaces
  topic_statement: Prevents resin degradation
- answer: Examine for visible charring, like brown or black marks, alongside a pitted
    and bubbled surface texture. Specifically, the 1064 nm wavelength ablates the
    resin matrix, exposing brittle glass fibers. Thus, it leads to substantial loss
    of surface gloss and structural integrity.
  question: If a laser accidentally contacts fiberglass, what kind of damage should
    I look for?
  topic_keyword: contacts fiberglass
  topic_statement: Ablates resin exposing fibers
- answer: Unlike metal dust, laser cleaning fiberglass at 5 J/cm² particularly generates
    toxic resin fumes and aerosolizes sharp sub-50μm glass fibers. Notably, these
    pose a severe inhalation risk, thus often requiring HEPA filtration beyond standard
    PPE.
  question: What are the specific health hazards of laser cleaning fiberglass compared
    to cleaning metal?
- answer: Notably, unlike steel, fiberglass's polymer resin strongly absorbs 1064
    nm laser energy. This indicates the substrate itself becomes vulnerable at fluences
    above ~5 J/cm², beyond just surface contaminants. Thus, precise parameter control
    remains essential to prevent thermal damage to the composite material.
  question: Why is fiberglass so problematic for laser cleaning compared to materials
    like rust or paint on steel?
  topic_keyword: fiberglass so problematic
  topic_statement: Polymer resin absorbs 1064 nm
- answer: Even with ultra-thin mold release, the risk remains extreme. Specifically,
    the fluence needed for contaminant removal—typically over 5 J/cm²—will almost
    certainly surpass the damage threshold of the sensitive polymer matrix, thus causing
    irreversible degradation to the underlying resin.
  question: Is there any scenario where laser treatment of fiberglass is acceptable,
    such as for very light surface mold release?
- answer: Epoxy and polyester resins degrade at varying temperatures, yet notably,
    both sustain damage from the ~5 J/cm² fluence essential for cleaning. Weave patterns
    play no role; specifically, the 1064 nm laser energy absorbs into the resin matrix
    binding the glass fibers, thus undermining the composite's structural integrity
    irrespective of its design.
  question: How does the weave and resin type (e.g., epoxy vs. polyester) affect its
    reaction to a laser?
  topic_keyword: weave and resin type
  topic_statement: Compromises structural integrity regardless
