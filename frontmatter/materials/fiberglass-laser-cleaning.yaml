caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the fiberglass surface shows contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues embedded
    among the fibers. This buildup leads to surface degradation, with visible pitting and slight fiber fraying.
  after: After laser cleaning, the fiberglass surface appears smooth and evenly restored to its original luster. No fiber
    damage or delamination shows, preserving the composite's integrity well, and it retains full strength for ongoing applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning is strongly discouraged for fiberglass composites. The polymer resin readily absorbs near-infrared
      energy at 1064 nm, leading to thermal degradation. Even at a conservative 5 J/cm² fluence, the resin matrix can burn
      and vaporize, catastrophically compromising the material's structural integrity.
    question: Can you safely use a laser cleaner to remove paint or contamination from a fiberglass surface?
  - answer: The 1064 nm laser energy is strongly absorbed by the polymer resin, causing rapid thermal decomposition and ablation
      at fluences around 5 J/cm². This process leaves behind exposed, frayed glass fibers and a charred surface, which critically
      degrades the material's structural integrity. The composite is simply not suited for this cleaning method.
    question: What happens to fiberglass when it's hit with a laser during cleaning?
  - answer: While UV lasers at 5 J/cm² reduce thermal effects, fiberglass remains highly vulnerable. The resin matrix can
      still degrade even with optimized ns-pulse settings. Most industrial systems risk material damage, making this application
      generally unsuitable.
    question: Are there any specific laser types or settings (wavelength, power) that make cleaning fiberglass less destructive?
  - answer: For fiberglass restoration, gentle mechanical abrasion with plastic media or chemical stripping are preferred.
      These methods avoid the thermal risks of laser processing, which requires precise control below 5 J/cm² to prevent resin
      degradation in the composite matrix.
    question: What is the best alternative to laser cleaning for preparing or restoring fiberglass surfaces?
  - answer: Look for visible charring (brown/black marks) and a pitted, bubbled texture. The 1064 nm wavelength can ablate
      the resin matrix, exposing brittle glass fibers. This causes a significant loss of surface gloss and structural integrity.
    question: If a laser accidentally contacts fiberglass, what kind of damage should I look for?
  - answer: Unlike metal dust, laser cleaning fiberglass at 5 J/cm² creates toxic resin fumes and aerosolizes sharp sub-50μm
      glass fibers. These pose a severe inhalation risk, often requiring HEPA filtration beyond standard PPE.
    question: What are the specific health hazards of laser cleaning fiberglass compared to cleaning metal?
  - answer: Unlike steel, fiberglass's polymer resin strongly absorbs 1064 nm laser energy. This makes the substrate itself
      vulnerable at fluences above ~5 J/cm², not just surface contaminants. Precise parameter control is essential to avoid
      thermal damage to the composite material.
    question: Why is fiberglass so problematic for laser cleaning compared to materials like rust or paint on steel?
  - answer: Even for ultra-thin mold release, the risk is extreme. The fluence required for contaminant removal, typically
      above 5 J/cm², will almost certainly exceed the damage threshold of the sensitive polymer matrix, causing irreversible
      degradation to the underlying resin.
    question: Is there any scenario where laser treatment of fiberglass is acceptable, such as for very light surface mold
      release?
  - answer: While epoxy and polyester resins degrade at different temperatures, both will be damaged by the ~5 J/cm² fluence
      required for cleaning. The weave pattern is irrelevant; the 1064 nm laser energy is absorbed by the resin matrix binding
      the glass fibers, compromising the composite's structural integrity regardless of its specific construction.
    question: How does the weave and resin type (e.g., epoxy vs. polyester) affect its reaction to a laser?
