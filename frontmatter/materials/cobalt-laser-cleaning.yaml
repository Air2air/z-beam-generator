caption:
  before: The microscopy of the contaminated cobalt surface reveals a textured landscape marred by clustered contaminants, including fine particulates and thin oxide scales. This surface shows evident degradation, with shallow pits and faded luster.
  after: After laser cleaning, the cobalt surface looks smooth and contaminant-free. This restoration demonstrates strong material integrity, with no signs of thermal alteration or weakening. The metal retains its original properties, supporting effective use in general applications.

  questions:
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes cobalt-based thermal barrier coatings when using optimized 1064nm parameters. Maintaining fluence below 2.5 J/cm² with 50μm spot size preserves the nickel superalloy substrate. This approach outperforms mechanical methods by eliminating surface damage while achieving complete coating removal in approximately three passes.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove cobalt-containing thermal barrier coatings from turbine blades without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: When laser cleaning cobalt alloys at 1064 nm wavelength, implement high-efficiency fume extraction due to toxic submicron particles. Maintain exposure below 0.02 mg/m³ OSHA limits using powered air-purifying respirators with P100 filters. The 100W laser parameters generate inhalable fumes requiring local exhaust ventilation at the source.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning cobalt-based alloys to prevent inhalation of toxic fumes?
  - answer: For Co-Cr alloys, use a higher fluence threshold near 2.5 J/cm² compared to steel or aluminum due to their superior thermal resistance. A 1064 nm wavelength and nanosecond pulses are optimal to overcome surface reflectivity and ablate oxides without damaging the substrate.
    question: How do laser parameters need to be adjusted when cleaning cobalt-chromium alloys compared to steel or aluminum?
  - answer: Properly tuned 1064nm nanosecond lasers at ~2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively remove cobalt oxides. The minimal heat-affected zone prevents significant phase changes, though some localized residual stress is possible. This preserves the superalloy's critical microstructural integrity.
    question: Does laser cleaning create any surface modification or phase changes in cobalt superalloys that could affect material performance?
  - answer: For cobalt stellite oxide removal, employ 1064nm nanosecond pulses at 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This threshold effectively ablates oxides while preserving the base alloy, maintaining surface integrity for critical applications.
    question: What is the best laser cleaning approach for removing oxide layers from cobalt-based stellite surfaces without removing base material?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes Co-60 contamination from cobalt surfaces using 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This process minimizes secondary waste compared to traditional chemical methods, offering superior radionuclide removal efficiency for nuclear decommissioning.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to decontaminate cobalt-60 contaminated surfaces in nuclear applications?
  - answer: Cobalt's high melting point (1495°C) and thermal conductivity demand precise fluence control near 2.5 J/cm². We optimize nanosecond pulses and 500 mm/s scanning to rapidly ablate oxides while managing heat diffusion, preventing substrate damage.
    question: How does the high melting point and thermal conductivity of cobalt affect laser cleaning efficiency and parameter selection?
  - answer: Cobalt debris requires hazardous waste classification due to toxic fine particles. Employ HEPA filtration rated for sub-micron capture, as our 50μm spot size at 100W generates significant aerosol. Always consult local regulations for disposal of this regulated metal.
    question: What are the waste management considerations for cobalt particles generated during laser cleaning operations?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares cobalt surfaces for thermal spray by removing oxides at 2.5 J/cm² without damaging the substrate. This method surpasses abrasive blasting in achieving superior cleanliness and surface activation, ensuring optimal adhesion for demanding applications in aerospace and medical devices. The process yields a highly active, contaminant-free surface.
    question: Is laser cleaning suitable for preparing cobalt surfaces for thermal spray or welding applications?
  - answer: Prevent cobalt oxide formation by maintaining an inert argon atmosphere during laser processing. Control thermal input using 100W average power and 2.5 J/cm² fluence to stay below the oxidation threshold. A final low-power pass can also be applied to ensure a pristine surface.
    question: How do you prevent the formation of cobalt oxide during laser cleaning of cobalt components?
