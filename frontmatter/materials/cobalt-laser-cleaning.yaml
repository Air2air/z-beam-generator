title: Cobalt Laser Cleaning
subtitle: Cobalt maintains its structural integrity under extreme heat and stress,
  a key trait for aerospace superalloys and medical implants

description: 'Cobalt stands out as a sturdy metal in aerospace and medical tools because
  it handles heat and wear so well. For laser cleaning, its high melting point around
  1495°C lets you push power levels without risking the base material melting. That
  strength means you can clean tough contaminants like oxides or residues effectively,
  but always monitor surface temperature to stay under 600°C and avoid unwanted oxidation.


  One weakness comes from its shiny surface, which reflects about two-thirds of the
  laser light, so absorption stays moderate at 37%. To fix this, bump up your fluence
  to around 2.5 J/cm² right from the start—it ensures enough energy gets through for
  clean ablation without wasting passes. Unlike aluminum that scatters heat fast,
  cobalt''s solid thermal conductivity of 100 W/m·K spreads warmth evenly, which helps
  prevent hot spots during cleaning.


  What sets cobalt apart is its role in superalloys, making it denser and harder than
  everyday steels at 220 HV. This hardness grips contaminants tighter, so you need
  a tighter spot size, like 50 micrometers, to focus the beam and break bonds precisely.
  And because it has zero porosity, laser energy won''t seep into the bulk—just clean
  the top layer, which simplifies things but demands steady scan speeds of 500 mm/s
  to avoid uneven results.


  An unusual trait is its decent thermal shock resistance, handling jumps up to 80
  K without cracking. In practice, this lets you use short pulses around 10 nanoseconds
  at 100 kHz repetition rates for quick, safe removal of buildup from oil and gas
  parts. Just overlap your scans by 50% over three passes to cover everything without
  digging too deep.


  Watch out for the ablation threshold at 1.2 J/cm²—go below it, and nothing happens;
  exceed the damage limit of 1.8 J/cm², and you etch the cobalt itself. Start with
  lower power, say 100 W, on a test patch, and adjust up if reflectivity causes incomplete
  cleaning. That way, you keep the surface smooth at 0.32 micrometers roughness post-treatment,
  ready for wear-resistant coatings or tooling reuse.'
