caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the float glass surface appears very-very contaminated
    with fine dust particles and oily residues that stick and spread unevenly. Contaminants
    show irregular shapes, so surface degradation includes tiny pits and scratches
    that make texture rough and light-scattering.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the float glass surface appears very-very
    smooth and pristine. Contaminants are removed thoroughly, then the surface is
    restored to original clarity without scratches. Material integrity is preserved
    fully, so no structural damage occurs. This ensures high restoration quality for
    everyday glass applications.

  questions:
  - answer: Untuk membersihkan float glass dengan aman, gunakan laser 1064nm dengan
      fluence di bawah 2.5 J/cm² untuk menghindari microfracture. Durasi pulsa nanosecond
      sekitar 10ns dan spot size 100μm memberikan energi yang cukup untuk menguapkan
      kontaminan tanpa merusak substrat kaca, mencegah akumulasi stres termal.
    question: What laser parameters are safe for cleaning float glass without causing
      micro-fractures or thermal stress?
  - answer: For float glass, maintain fluence below 2.5 J/cm² using nanosecond pulses
      at 1064 nm wavelength. This effectively ablates calcium carbonate deposits while
      preserving the pristine silicate surface. A 100 µm spot size scanned at 500
      mm/s ensures uniform stain removal without thermal etching.
    question: How do I remove mineral deposits and hard water stains from float glass
      with laser cleaning without etching the surface?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes paint overspray from float glass using
      2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. For organic paints, lower pulse energy
      prevents residue fusion, while inorganic pigments may require optimized 50%
      beam overlap. Post-cleaning inspection with oblique-angle lighting confirms
      mark-free surfaces.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove paint overspray from float glass
      without creating permanent marks?
  - answer: Maintain precise beam control near edges using the 100 μm spot size to
      prevent seal degradation. Our 2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively removes contaminants
      while fume extraction manages vaporized residues. Always employ appropriate
      eyewear for the 1064 nm wavelength to ensure operator safety.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning float glass near
      sensitive areas like window seals or frames?
  - answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² preserves optical clarity.
      This fluence removes contaminants without inducing surface roughening that would
      scatter light. Spectrophotometry confirms no measurable transmission loss in
      float glass when using these optimized parameters.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the optical clarity or light transmission
      properties of float glass?
  - answer: The tin side requires gentler parameters due to its tin-rich surface.
      Reduce fluence to ~2.0 J/cm² and increase scan speed to 600 mm/s to prevent
      damage, while the air side can tolerate the standard 2.5 J/cm². Always verify
      the side first.
    question: How do I clean the tin side vs air side of float glass with lasers,
      and does it require different parameters?
  - answer: Float glass up to 6mm thick can be safely processed using our 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence and 100W power settings. For thicker panels, we reduce the repetition
      rate below 50 kHz to manage thermal conductivity limitations and prevent stress
      fractures.
    question: What is the maximum thickness of float glass that can be safely laser
      cleaned without risk of thermal cracking?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes adhesive residues from float glass
      using 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. This vaporizes contaminants below
      the glass damage threshold, preventing residue redistribution without chemical
      solvents.
    question: Can laser cleaning remove adhesive residues and stickers from float
      glass without leaving marks or residue?
  - answer: Visual hazing or micro-fractures indicate excessive fluence above the
      2.5 J/cm² threshold. For float glass, real-time monitoring should detect localized
      thermal stress exceeding safe limits. Immediately reduce pulse energy or increase
      the 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent subsurface damage.
    question: What are the signs of improper laser cleaning on float glass that indicate
      parameter adjustment is needed?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size removes mortar
      completely without micro-scratches, unlike abrasive methods. This non-contact
      process preserves the pristine float glass surface, offering superior efficiency
      and eliminating chemical residue for high-value construction applications.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods for removing
      construction debris and mortar from float glass?
