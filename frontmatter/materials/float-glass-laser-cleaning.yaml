caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the float glass surface displays straightforward contamination
    from fine dust particles and oily residues that adhere and spread unevenly. These
    irregular contaminant shapes, through this process, lead to tiny pits and scratches,
    roughening the texture and promoting light scattering.
  after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the float glass surface turns very smooth
    and pristine. This process removes contaminants thoroughly, restoring original
    clarity without scratches. Material integrity stays fully preserved efficiently,
    so no structural damage happens. It delivers high restoration quality for practical
    everyday glass uses.

faq:
- answer: From my work as a laser cleaning expert in Indonesia, I suggest a straightforward
    setup with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm, featuring pulse durations of
    5-20 ns, fluences under 0.5 J/cm², and scanning speeds above 100 mm/s. This process,
    validated in local projects, reliably avoids micro-fractures and thermal stress
    on float glass.
  question: What laser parameters are safe for cleaning float glass without causing
    micro-fractures or thermal stress?
- answer: For float glass, a practical approach is to keep fluence below 2.5 J/cm²
    with nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. This process ablates calcium carbonate deposits
    while preserving the pristine silicate surface. Scanning a 100 µm spot at 500
    mm/s ensures uniform stain removal without thermal etching.
  question: How do I remove mineral deposits and hard water stains from float glass
    with laser cleaning without etching the surface?
  topic_keyword: etching the surface
  topic_statement: Fluence below 2.5 J/cm²
- answer: Laser cleaning efficiently removes paint overspray from float glass with
    a straightforward 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. For organic paints,
    lower pulse energy avoids residue fusion, while inorganic pigments often need
    this process of 50% beam overlap. Oblique-angle lighting inspection afterward
    verifies mark-free results.
  question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove paint overspray from float glass
    without creating permanent marks?
  topic_keyword: permanent marks
  topic_statement: Low fluence prevents residue fusion
- answer: Use a practical approach for precise beam control near edges with the 100
    μm spot size to avoid seal degradation. Our 2.5 J/cm² fluence efficiently removes
    contaminants, while fume extraction handles vaporized residues. Always wear suitable
    eyewear for the 1064 nm wavelength to protect operators.
  question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning float glass near
    sensitive areas like window seals or frames?
- answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² efficiently preserves optical
    clarity. This process removes contaminants without inducing surface roughening
    that scatters light. Spectrophotometry confirms no transmission loss in float
    glass using these optimized settings.
  question: Does laser cleaning affect the optical clarity or light transmission properties
    of float glass?
  topic_keyword: light transmission properties
  topic_statement: Preserves optical clarity without roughening
- answer: The tin side demands practical adjustments for its tin-rich surface. In
    this process, lower fluence to ~2.0 J/cm² and raise scan speed to 600 mm/s to
    avoid harm, whereas the air side withstands the usual 2.5 J/cm². Verify the side
    upfront.
  question: How do I clean the tin side vs air side of float glass with lasers, and
    does it require different parameters?
- answer: For float glass up to 6mm thick, this process safely handles it with our
    2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power settings. With thicker panels, we lower the repetition
    rate below 50 kHz in a practical manner to address thermal conductivity limits
    and avoid stress fractures.
  question: What is the maximum thickness of float glass that can be safely laser
    cleaned without risk of thermal cracking?
  topic_keyword: thermal cracking
  topic_statement: Safe up to 6mm thickness
- answer: Laser cleaning offers a straightforward way to remove adhesive residues
    from float glass, applying 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. This process
    vaporizes contaminants below the glass damage threshold, efficiently avoiding
    residue redistribution without chemical solvents.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove adhesive residues and stickers from float glass
    without leaving marks or residue?
  topic_keyword: adhesive residues and stickers
  topic_statement: Vaporizes below damage threshold
- answer: Visual hazing or micro-fractures straightforwardly signal excessive fluence
    over the 2.5 J/cm² threshold. For float glass, real-time monitoring in this process
    detects localized thermal stress beyond safe limits. Practically, cut pulse energy
    right away or boost scan speed to 500 mm/s to avoid subsurface damage.
  question: What are the signs of improper laser cleaning on float glass that indicate
    parameter adjustment is needed?
  topic_keyword: parameter adjustment
  topic_statement: Excessive fluence causes micro-fractures
- answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size removes mortar
    completely without micro-scratches—straightforward and practical, unlike abrasive
    methods. This process preserves the pristine float glass surface efficiently,
    eliminating chemical residue for high-value construction applications.
  question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods for removing construction
    debris and mortar from float glass?
