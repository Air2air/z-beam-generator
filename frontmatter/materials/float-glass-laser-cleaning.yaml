caption:
  before: We've found the contaminated float glass surface riddled with irregular spots and fine debris that disrupt its smoothness at high magnification. These stubborn films and particles cling tightly, creating a mottled texture that scatters light in uneven patches across the whole area. Starting the laser cleaning process here demands care to avoid spreading the mess further.
  after: After treatment, we've observed the float glass surface transformed into a flawless, even plane free from any lingering marks or roughness. Light now glides smoothly over it, revealing a
faq:
- question: What laser parameters are safe for cleaning float glass without causing micro-fractures or thermal stress?
  answer: From my work as a laser cleaning expert in Indonesia, I suggest a straightforward setup with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm, featuring pulse durations of 5-20 ns, fluences under 0.5 J/cm², and scanning speeds above 100 mm/s. This process, validated in local projects, reliably avoids micro-fractures and thermal stress on float glass.
- question: How do I remove mineral deposits and hard water stains from float glass with laser cleaning without **etching the surface**?
  answer: '**Fluence below 2.5 J/cm²**. For float glass, a practical approach is to keep fluence below 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. This process ablates calcium carbonate deposits while preserving the pristine silicate surface. Scanning a 100 µm spot at 500 mm/s ensures uniform stain removal without thermal etching.'
- question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove paint overspray from float glass without creating **permanent marks**?
  answer: '**Low fluence prevents residue fusion**. Laser cleaning efficiently removes paint overspray from float glass with a straightforward 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. For organic paints, lower pulse energy avoids residue fusion, while inorganic pigments often need this process of 50% beam overlap. Oblique-angle lighting inspection afterward verifies mark-free results.'
- question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning float glass near sensitive areas like window seals or frames?
  answer: Use a practical approach for precise beam control near edges with the 100 μm spot size to avoid seal degradation. Our 2.5 J/cm² fluence efficiently removes contaminants, while fume extraction handles vaporized residues. Always wear suitable eyewear for the 1064 nm wavelength to protect operators.
- question: Does laser cleaning affect the optical clarity or **light transmission properties** of float glass?
  answer: '**Preserves optical clarity without roughening**. Properly configured laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² efficiently preserves optical clarity. This process removes contaminants without inducing surface roughening that scatters light. Spectrophotometry confirms no transmission loss in float glass using these optimized settings.'
- question: How do I clean the tin side vs air side of float glass with lasers, and does it require different parameters?
  answer: The tin side demands practical adjustments for its tin-rich surface. In this process, lower fluence to ~2.0 J/cm² and raise scan speed to 600 mm/s to avoid harm, whereas the air side withstands the usual 2.5 J/cm². Verify the side upfront.
- question: What is the maximum thickness of float glass that can be safely laser cleaned without risk of **thermal cracking**?
  answer: '**Safe up to 6mm thickness**. For float glass up to 6mm thick, this process safely handles it with our 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power settings. With thicker panels, we lower the repetition rate below 50 kHz in a practical manner to address thermal conductivity limits and avoid stress fractures.'
- question: Can laser cleaning remove **adhesive residues and stickers** from float glass without leaving marks or residue?
  answer: '**Vaporizes below damage threshold**. Laser cleaning offers a straightforward way to remove adhesive residues from float glass, applying 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size. This process vaporizes contaminants below the glass damage threshold, efficiently avoiding residue redistribution without chemical solvents.'
- question: What are the signs of improper laser cleaning on float glass that indicate **parameter adjustment** is needed?
  answer: '**Excessive fluence causes micro-fractures**. Visual hazing or micro-fractures straightforwardly signal excessive fluence over the 2.5 J/cm² threshold. For float glass, real-time monitoring in this process detects localized thermal stress beyond safe limits. Practically, cut pulse energy right away or boost scan speed to 500 mm/s to avoid subsurface damage.'
- question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods for removing **construction debris and mortar** from float glass?
  answer: '**Preserves pristine surface without scratches**. Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 μm spot size removes mortar completely without micro-scratches—straightforward and practical, unlike abrasive methods. This process preserves the pristine float glass surface efficiently, eliminating chemical residue for high-value construction applications.'
