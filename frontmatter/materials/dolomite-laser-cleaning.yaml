title: Dolomite Laser Cleaning
name: Dolomite
settings_description: We've found that dolomite stands out from limestone in laser
  cleaning because its magnesium mix makes it denser and less porous. This means it
  resists heat buildup better, so we typically use steady, moderate power pulses to
  lift contaminants without cracking the surface. You'll get even results this way.
  Just watch for overexposure at the end—it can dull the finish if you're not careful.
