title: Dolomite Laser Cleaning
name: Dolomite
settings_description: We've found that dolomite stands out from limestone in laser
  cleaning because its magnesium mix makes it denser and less porous. This means it
  resists heat buildup better, so we typically use steady, moderate power pulses to
  lift contaminants without cracking the surface. You'll get even results this way.
  Just watch for overexposure at the end—it can dull the finish if you're not careful.
faq:
- question: How does dolomite compare to limestone when laser cleaning?
  answer: I've seen dolomite clean up more evenly than limestone because it handles
    heat better without cracking as easily. While limestone tends to absorb too much
    energy and pit, dolomite's structure lets you remove dirt steadily. Just keep
    the laser moving to avoid any hot spots on its surface.
- question: What are best practices for laser cleaning dolomite surfaces?
  answer: Start with a low-intensity pass to test the surface response on dolomite.
    Move the laser steadily across the area to prevent uneven heating. This approach
    removes contaminants effectively while preserving the stone's natural finish.
- question: Why might dolomite show discoloration after laser cleaning, and how to
    fix it?
  answer: Discoloration often happens if the laser lingers too long, causing surface
    changes in dolomite's mineral makeup. Compared to harder stones like granite,
    dolomite reacts more sensitively to prolonged exposure. To fix it, reduce power
    slightly and clean in short bursts, then rinse with water to even out the tone.

  before: I've seen dolomite surfaces like this before cleaning, where grime clings
    tightly to every crevice at 1000x magnification. Dark spots and uneven layers
    obscure the natural grain patterns completely. Tiny debris scatters across the
    rough texture, making details hard to spot.
  after: After laser treatment, the same view reveals a crisp, even surface shining
    through at 1000x. Grains emerge sharp and distinct, free from any clinging dirt
    now. Smooth areas reflect light cleanly, highlighting the stone
