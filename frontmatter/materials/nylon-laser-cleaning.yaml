title: Nylon Laser Cleaning
name: Nylon
settings_description: 'When laser cleaning Nylon, start with low power settings right
  away. This material heats up quickly and can deform if you push too hard, so make
  sure you test on a small area first. You''ll avoid melting the surface by keeping
  pulses short and spaced out.


  Begin your setup by adjusting the laser to a gentle scan speed. Nylon''s flexibility
  helps it recover from minor stress, but its low heat tolerance means you must monitor
  for warping early on. Increase intensity gradually only after seeing clean results
  without residue.


  This approach clears contaminants effectively while preserving the part''s toughness.
  Watch for any yellowing—that signals overheating, so dial back immediately.'
