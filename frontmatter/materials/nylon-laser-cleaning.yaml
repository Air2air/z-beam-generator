title: Nylon Laser Cleaning
name: Nylon
settings_description: 'When laser cleaning Nylon, start with low power settings right
  away. This material heats up quickly and can deform if you push too hard, so make
  sure you test on a small area first. You''ll avoid melting the surface by keeping
  pulses short and spaced out.


  Begin your setup by adjusting the laser to a gentle scan speed. Nylon''s flexibility
  helps it recover from minor stress, but its low heat tolerance means you must monitor
  for warping early on. Increase intensity gradually only after seeing clean results
  without residue.


  This approach clears contaminants effectively while preserving the part''s toughness.
  Watch for any yellowing—that signals overheating, so dial back immediately.'
faq:
- question: How can I laser clean Nylon without causing melting?
  answer: I've seen Nylon respond well to gentle laser passes that target surface
    grime first. Start by scanning the area slowly to loosen dirt without building
    up too much heat in the material. This approach keeps the Nylon's surface intact
    while removing contaminants effectively, as the plastic tends to soften under
    prolonged exposure.
- question: What are the best practices for laser cleaning dirty Nylon gears?
  answer: When cleaning Nylon gears, begin with a low-intensity sweep to test the
    material's reaction. Follow up with focused bursts on stubborn spots, always moving
    the laser steadily to avoid hot spots. In my experience, this method restores
    the gears' smooth operation without compromising their flexibility or strength.
- question: Why does Nylon sometimes discolor during laser cleaning, and how to fix
    it?
  answer: Nylon can pick up slight discoloration if the laser lingers too long on
    one area, drawing out underlying pigments. To fix this, reduce dwell time and
    incorporate short cooling intervals between passes.
caption:
  before: When examining the contaminated Nylon surface at 1000x, you see dirt particles
    scattered across the fibers, creating a bumpy, uneven layer. Grime clings tightly
    to the edges, dulling the material's natural weave and hiding finer details. This
    buildup makes the whole texture look rough and obscured.
  after: After laser treatment, the Nylon surface appears completely clear and smooth
    under 1000x view. Fibers stand out evenly now, without any clinging residues or
    rough spots. The clean finish
