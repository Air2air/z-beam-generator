caption:
  before: Under microscopic scrutiny, the iridium surface displays clustered contaminants like fine dust particles and residual
    oils from manufacturing handling. These irregular deposits, measuring 5-15 microns with rough textures, form patchy films
    that obscure the metal's inherent smoothness. Surface degradation appears as subtle micro-pits and hazy oxidation layers,
    compromising reflectivity in laser optics for semiconductor fabrication.
  after: After cleaning, the iridium surface restores to a smooth, highly reflective finish, preserving full material integrity
    without pitting or oxidation. This quality supports reliable performance in laser optic coatings for precision systems.

  questions:
  - answer: Yes, you can safely laser clean iridium with precise parameters. Its high reflectivity and melting point require
      a 1064 nm wavelength and careful fluence control below 2.5 J/cm² to avoid surface damage. This method effectively removes
      contaminants without compromising the material's integrity.
    question: Can you safely laser clean iridium components, or will the laser damage the surface?
  - answer: For Iridium, the 1064nm wavelength is optimal. It provides sufficient absorption to remove oxides and carbon deposits
      at a fluence of 2.5 J/cm², while the metal's high reflectivity at 532nm makes it less effective. This ensures efficient
      contaminant ablation without damaging the precious substrate.
    question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning contaminants from iridium without affecting
      the base metal?
  - answer: Iridium primarily forms volatile IrO₂ above 600°C, but surfaces also accumulate carbonaceous deposits and metallic
      transfer. Our 1064 nm systems, operating at 2.5 J/cm², effectively ablate these tenacious layers without the thermal
      damage associated with conventional methods.
    question: What specific contaminants or oxides are typically found on iridium surfaces that require laser cleaning?
  - answer: Laser cleaning iridium at 1064 nm wavelength generates hazardous iridium oxide fumes requiring robust ventilation.
      Always consult the SDS for specific exposure limits and employ HEPA filtration to capture sub-micron particles produced
      during ablation at 2.5 J/cm² fluence.
    question: Are there any toxic fumes or safety hazards generated when laser cleaning iridium?
  - answer: Iridium's brittleness demands precise laser control. Exceeding 2.5 J/cm² fluence or incorrect pulse width can
      induce micro-cracking from thermal stress. We use a 50 µm spot and 45W power for controlled ablation, preventing mechanical
      damage to this hard metal.
    question: How does the extreme hardness and brittleness of iridium affect the laser cleaning process?
  - answer: Laser cleaning's higher initial investment is quickly justified for iridium components. At 2.5 J/cm² fluence,
      it preserves every micron of this costly metal, unlike abrasives, while eliminating chemical waste and the risk of hydrogen
      embrittlement entirely.
    question: What is the typical cost-benefit analysis for using laser cleaning on a high-value material like iridium versus
      chemical or mechanical methods?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares iridium for plating using a 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This
      process removes contaminants without microstructural changes, creating an activated surface with optimal roughness for
      superior adhesion.
    question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare an iridium surface for subsequent processes like plating or welding?
  - answer: Iridium's extreme hardness and low ductility at room temperature cause rapid tool wear and fracture during machining.
      Laser cleaning, using a 1064 nm wavelength at a 2.5 J/cm² fluence, provides a non-contact alternative that avoids mechanical
      stress and material loss, preserving the integrity of these high-value components.
    question: Why is iridium so difficult to machine or process with traditional methods, making laser cleaning an attractive
      option?
  - answer: Laser cleaning is indispensable for refurbishing iridium crucibles used in high-purity crystal growth, where even
      trace contaminants at the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold can compromise material integrity. It's also critical for maintaining
      the electrodes in high-performance aerospace spark plugs, ensuring optimal ignition and longevity.
    question: What are the real-world applications where laser cleaning of iridium is most critical?
