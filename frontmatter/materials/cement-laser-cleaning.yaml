caption:
  before: Under the microscope, the cement surface reveals a rugged terrain marred
    by contaminants. Fine particles of silica dust and organic residues cling to pores,
    forming irregular clusters that obscure the matrix. This contamination accelerates
    degradation, evident in microcracks and pitting, where hydration products erode,
    weakening the masonry's integrity over time.
  after: After laser cleaning, the cement surface appears remarkably restored, free
    from ingrained dirt and efflorescence that marred its original texture. This precision,
    it reveals the masonry's subtle grain without abrasion, ensuring structural integrity
    remains uncompromised. The restoration quality excels, blending seamlessly with
    adjacent areas for a uniform, durable finish suitable for heritage or modern applications.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: For cement removal from steel, utilize a 1064 nm wavelength laser with
      approximately 100 W average power and a 12 ns pulse duration. A fluence near
      3.2 J/cm² and a scanning speed of 500 mm/s effectively ablate the residue while
      the short pulses prevent heat accumulation, preserving the underlying steel
      substrate from thermal damage.
    question: What laser parameters work best for removing cement residue from steel
      surfaces without damaging the substrate?
  - answer: Laser cleaning excels at removing cement splatter with minimal substrate
      damage. Using a 100W laser at 3.2 J/cm² fluence effectively ablates contaminants
      while preserving the underlying metal. This method is significantly faster and
      more cost-effective than manual chiseling, eliminating tool wear and abrasive
      waste.
    question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing cement splatter from construction
      equipment and tools?
  - answer: Laser cleaning at 3.2 J/cm² significantly reduces hazardous dust, but
      crystalline silica remains a concern. Strict respiratory protection and local
      exhaust ventilation are mandatory to comply with OSHA silica exposure limits,
      typically below 50 µg/m³.
    question: Does laser cleaning create hazardous dust when removing cement, and
      what safety measures are required?
  - answer: Properly calibrated laser parameters prevent damage to concrete. At 3.2
      J/cm² fluence and 100W average power, we effectively ablate contaminants while
      preserving the cementitious matrix and avoiding harmful aggregate exposure or
      surface etching.
    question: Can laser cleaning damage concrete surfaces when trying to remove surface
      contaminants?
  - answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes cement layers up to 500 µm thick using
      our standard 3.2 J/cm² fluence. For thicker deposits, multiple passes are viable,
      but buildup exceeding 1 mm typically requires mechanical pre-treatment to ensure
      efficient processing and protect the substrate integrity.
    question: What's the maximum thickness of cement buildup that laser cleaning can
      effectively remove?
  - answer: Laser ablation at 3.2 J/cm² fluence selectively removes cement from glass
      without chemicals, eliminating residue and substrate etching risks. This dry
      process is significantly faster than chemical dissolution and presents no environmental
      hazards from waste streams.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to chemical methods for removing cement
      from delicate surfaces like glass or ceramics?
  - answer: For cement cleaning, pulsed fiber lasers at 1064 nm wavelength are optimal.
      Their short 12 ns pulses and 3.2 J/cm² fluence efficiently ablate contaminants
      while minimizing heat diffusion, preserving the underlying substrate from thermal
      stress.
    question: What type of laser (fiber, pulsed, continuous wave) works best for cement
      removal applications?
  - answer: Properly tuned laser parameters, like 3.2 J/cm² fluence, selectively remove
      contaminants while preserving the original cement matrix. This creates an ideal
      anchor profile for coatings, often superior to the mechanical damage caused
      by abrasive blasting.
    question: Does laser cleaning affect the surface profile or roughness of concrete
      when used for surface preparation?
  - answer: We carefully adjust the fluence, typically around 3.2 J/cm², to match
      the specific aggregate hardness. For tougher compositions, we may increase the
      scan speed beyond 500 mm/s to prevent micro-fracturing while still effectively
      removing contaminants.
    question: How do you handle the varying composition of cement (with different
      aggregates and additives) during laser cleaning?
  - answer: Given cement's high ablation threshold of 3.2 J/cm², protecting the optics
      from alkaline dust is paramount. Your fume extraction system requires frequent
      filter changes, and sensitive components must be sealed against the fine, abrasive
      particulate generated.
    question: What are the maintenance considerations for laser equipment when regularly
      cleaning cement-contaminated surfaces?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning can effectively remove cement from porous masonry.
      Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 3.2 J/cm² fluence and a 12 ns pulse width minimizes
      heat diffusion, allowing selective ablation of the contaminant. This preserves
      the delicate substrate by preventing subsurface thermal stress in materials
      like historic brick or natural stone.
    question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove cement from porous surfaces like
      brick or natural stone without causing damage?
  - answer: Laser cleaning offers superior economic feasibility for large cement projects
      despite higher initial investment. Operating at 100W with 500mm/s scan speeds,
      it achieves 2-3x higher productivity than traditional methods while reducing
      labor by 60%. The ROI becomes favorable for projects exceeding 500m² due to
      reduced consumables and minimal surface preparation needs.
    question: What is the economic feasibility of using laser cleaning for cement
      removal compared to traditional methods on large construction projects?
