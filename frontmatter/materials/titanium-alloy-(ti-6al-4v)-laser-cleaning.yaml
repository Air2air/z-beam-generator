title: Titanium Alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) Laser Cleaning
name: Titanium Alloy (Ti-6Al-4V)
faq:
- question: '[How do I avoid overheating when laser cleaning Ti-6Al-4V parts?'
  answer: I've seen overheating ruin titanium surfaces during cleaning more than once.
    This alloy holds heat well but can warp if you push too hard. Keep pulses short
    and move the beam steadily to stay safe.
- question: '[What''s the best way to remove oxide layers from Ti-6Al-4V using lasers?'
  answer: When cleaning titanium alloys, oxide layers come off cleanly compared to
    steels that pit easily. Start with lower power and scan slowly for even removal.
    This works best in a controlled atmosphere to prevent re-oxidation right away.
- question: '[Why does Ti-6Al-4V sometimes show discoloration after laser cleaning?'
  answer: Discoloration pops up on titanium because it reacts quickly with air during
    the process. I've found using a shielding gas helps cut that down and keeps the
    finish bright. Adjust your speed to match the beam focus for cleaner results.
caption:
  before: We've found the contaminated surface on this titanium alloy shows heavy
    buildup. Dark spots and uneven layers cover the base material completely. Scratches
    and debris make the texture look rough and cluttered.
  after: After laser treatment, the surface appears smooth and uniform. We see no
    remaining spots or layers now. The clean material shines evenly under magnification.
