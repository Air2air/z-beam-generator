title: PEEK Laser Cleaning
name: PEEK
settings_description: When laser cleaning PEEK, you'll want to tackle its low absorption
  of laser energy first. This thermoplastic stays mostly transparent to the beam,
  so heat builds up slowly but can suddenly degrade the surface if you're not careful.
  Start with lower power settings to gently remove contaminants without melting the
  material. Make sure you use short pulses—they help control the heat and prevent
  cracking on this strong, non-porous plastic. Watch out mid-process for any discoloration;
  dial back the speed right away to avoid weakening its heat resistance. Adjust scans
  to overlap minimally, bringing back a clean finish while keeping PEEK's durability
  intact.
material_description: The key with PEEK lies in its unmatched ability to endure extreme
  heat and harsh chemicals without compromising strength, so it thrives in demanding
  industrial setups where lesser plastics simply break down.

  before: When examining the contaminated PEEK surface at 1000x, you spot thick layers
    of debris clinging everywhere. Dark spots and irregular bumps cover the entire
    view, blocking any smooth areas. This mess creates a rough, uneven texture that
    hides the material's natural form.
  after: After laser treatment, you see the PEEK surface restored to a clear, uniform
    shine at 1000x. Smooth planes and fine details emerge without any clinging residues.
    The treatment wipes away all traces, revealing a clean

- question: How do I safely start laser cleaning PEEK parts without causing damage?
  answer: You must begin by selecting a low-power laser setting to match PEEK's heat
    resistance, ensuring the beam gently removes contaminants without overheating
    the surface. Make sure you scan the area slowly and evenly, allowing the material's
    strong structure to handle the process without warping or weakening. This approach
    brings back the smooth finish effectively, keeping the part's durable properties
    intact for continued use.
- question: What happens if PEEK surfaces discolor during laser cleaning?
  answer: Start with checking your laser intensity right away, as PEEK's low absorption
    can lead to uneven heating if the power is too high. You should adjust the pulse
    duration to shorter bursts, which helps dissipate heat quickly through its moderate
    conductivity and prevents any color changes. Keep monitoring the surface closely,
    and this will restore the original appearance without compromising the material's
    toughness.
- question: Can laser cleaning affect PEEK's strength after multiple sessions?
  answer: You must test a small area
