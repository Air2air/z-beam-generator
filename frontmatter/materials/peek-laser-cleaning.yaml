title: PEEK Laser Cleaning
material_description: The secret to PEEK's success is its remarkable resistance to intense heat and aggressive chemicals, all without losing its structural integrity, making it perfect for rigorous industrial applications where ordinary plastics would quickly fail.

  before: When examining the contaminated PEEK surface at 1000x, you spot thick layers of debris clinging everywhere. Dark spots and irregular bumps cover the entire view, blocking any smooth areas. This mess creates a rough, uneven texture that hides the material's natural form.
  after: After laser treatment, you see the PEEK surface restored to a clear, uniform shine at 1000x. Smooth planes and fine details emerge without any clinging residues. The treatment wipes away all traces, revealing a clean
faq:
- question: How do I safely start laser cleaning PEEK parts without causing damage?
  answer: You must begin by selecting a low-power laser setting to match PEEK's heat resistance, ensuring the beam gently removes contaminants without overheating the surface. Make sure you scan the area slowly and evenly, allowing the material's strong structure to handle the process without warping or weakening. This approach brings back the smooth finish effectively, keeping the part's durable properties intact for continued use.
- question: What happens if PEEK surfaces discolor during laser cleaning?
  answer: Start with checking your laser intensity right away, as PEEK's low absorption can lead to uneven heating if the power is too high. You should adjust the pulse duration to shorter bursts, which helps dissipate heat quickly through its moderate conductivity and prevents any color changes. Keep monitoring the surface closely, and this will restore the original appearance without compromising the material's toughness.
- question: Can laser cleaning affect PEEK's strength after multiple sessions?
  answer: You must test a small area
