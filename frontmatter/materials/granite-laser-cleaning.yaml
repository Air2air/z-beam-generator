caption:
  before: Advanced microscopy imaging at 500x magnification reveals heavy contamination on the untreated granite surface, with dark soot particles and organic residues adhering to mineral grains. Visible degradation includes surface pitting, micro-cracks, and discoloration from environmental exposure, compromising the stone's texture and performance integrity.
  after: Advanced post-laser cleaning microscopy reveals a restored granite surface with contaminants fully removed, exposing clean quartz and feldspar crystals. The material maintains structural integrity with minimal ablation, smooth topography, and no residual damage, delivering optimized restoration quality at 500x magnification.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How does laser cleaning remove biological growth like lichens from Granite without causing damage?
    answer: Through a systematic methodology, laser ablation precisely eliminates biological contaminants while preserving the granite's mineral composition and polished surface integrity.
  - question: Can laser cleaning safely remove rust stains from polished Granite countertops?
    answer: From a systematic perspective, laser cleaning precisely removes rust by vaporizing iron oxide while preserving the granite's sealant and structural integrity.
  - question: What advantages does laser cleaning offer over traditional chemical cleaners for maintaining Granite monuments?
    answer: Laser cleaning offers a systematic methodology for removing contaminants while precisely preserving stone patina and engraving details, ensuring long-term conservation.
  - question: Is laser cleaning suitable for all types of Granite, regardless of color or mineral composition?
    answer: Our systematic methodology ensures precise calibration for all granite types. While feldspar and mica content affects absorption, our research-based framework guarantees comprehensive cleaning across the color spectrum.
  - question: How does laser cleaning address the potential for mineral-specific degradation in Granite, like biotite oxidation?
    answer: Our systematic laser methodology prevents heat-induced oxidation in biotite minerals, enabling precise contaminant removal without accelerating geological weathering processes.
  - question: Why is laser cleaning recommended for delicate Granite carvings and engraved details?
    answer: Laser cleaning provides a systematic methodology, enabling conservators to precisely remove contaminants from intricate carvings without mechanical wear.
  - question: Can laser cleaning restore the original polish and reflectivity of weathered Granite cladding?
    answer: Laser cleaning systematically removes embedded contaminants, precisely revealing the original stone. A comprehensive repolishing methodology typically follows to achieve high-gloss finishes.
