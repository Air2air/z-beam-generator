caption:
  before: Advanced microscopy imaging at 500x magnification reveals heavy contamination
    on the untreated granite surface, with dark soot particles and organic residues
    adhering to mineral grains. Visible degradation includes surface pitting, micro-cracks,
    and discoloration from environmental exposure, compromising the stone's texture
    and performance integrity.
  after: Advanced post-laser cleaning microscopy reveals a restored granite surface
    with contaminants fully removed, exposing clean quartz and feldspar crystals.
    The material maintains structural integrity with minimal ablation, smooth topography,
    and no residual damage, delivering optimized restoration quality at 500x magnification.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How does laser cleaning remove biological growth like lichens from Granite
      without causing damage?
    answer: Through a systematic methodology, laser ablation precisely eliminates
      biological contaminants while preserving the granite's mineral composition and
      polished surface integrity.
  - question: Can laser cleaning safely remove rust stains from polished Granite countertops?
    answer: From a systematic perspective, laser cleaning precisely removes rust by
      vaporizing iron oxide while preserving the granite's sealant and structural
      integrity.
  - question: What advantages does laser cleaning offer over traditional chemical
      cleaners for maintaining Granite monuments?
    answer: Laser cleaning offers a systematic methodology for removing contaminants
      while precisely preserving stone patina and engraving details, ensuring long-term
      conservation.
  - question: Is laser cleaning suitable for all types of Granite, regardless of color
      or mineral composition?
    answer: Our systematic methodology ensures precise calibration for all granite
      types. While feldspar and mica content affects absorption, our research-based
      framework guarantees comprehensive cleaning across the color spectrum.
  - question: How does laser cleaning address the potential for mineral-specific degradation
      in Granite, like biotite oxidation?
    answer: Our systematic laser methodology prevents heat-induced oxidation in biotite
      minerals, enabling precise contaminant removal without accelerating geological
      weathering processes.
  - question: Why is laser cleaning recommended for delicate Granite carvings and
      engraved details?
    answer: Laser cleaning provides a systematic methodology, enabling conservators
      to precisely remove contaminants from intricate carvings without mechanical
      wear.
  - question: Can laser cleaning restore the original polish and reflectivity of weathered
      Granite cladding?
    answer: Laser cleaning systematically removes embedded contaminants, precisely
      revealing the original stone. A comprehensive repolishing methodology typically
      follows to achieve high-gloss finishes.
