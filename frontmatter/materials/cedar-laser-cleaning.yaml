  before: Under microscopy, cedar's porous surface traps dirt particles and oils,
    degrading fibers with roughening and staining in cleaning tasks.
  after: After cleaning Cedar wood surfaces, the restoration yields a smooth, even
    finish that revives the natural grain without compromising integrity. Pores remain
    intact, free of residues, ensuring durability for applications like furniture
    refinishing at companies such as Restoration Hardware. This process enhances aesthetic
    appeal while maintaining the wood's structural strength, preventing warping or
    discoloration over time.

faq:
  questions:
  - answer: Yes, cedar can be safely laser cleaned with precise parameters to prevent
      charring. We recommend a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence to effectively
      remove contaminants while preserving the wood's natural resins. This approach
      minimizes heat diffusion, protecting the delicate surface from discoloration.
    question: Can cedar wood be safely laser cleaned without causing surface damage
      or discoloration?
  - answer: For cedar siding, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength at 100 W average power
      with 12 ns pulses. Maintain fluence around 2.5 J/cm² for effective soot and
      mildew removal without damaging the wood substrate. This combination provides
      sufficient energy for contaminant ablation while minimizing heat diffusion into
      the delicate cedar surface.
    question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best for
      cleaning soot and mildew from cedar siding?
  - answer: Properly tuned 1064nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively
      removes contaminants while preserving cedar's natural protective oils. This
      minimally invasive process maintains the wood's inherent rot resistance without
      compromising the integrity of surface-applied sealants.
    question: How does laser cleaning affect cedar's natural weather-resistant properties
      and preservative treatments?
  - answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes old paint from cedar shingles
      while preserving the delicate grain. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence selectively ablates the paint layer without damaging the underlying
      wood substrate, unlike abrasive mechanical methods.
    question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing old paint from cedar shingles
      without damaging the wood grain?
  - answer: Cedar's natural resins generate significant toxic fumes when ablated at
      100W. You'll need industrial ventilation and a P100 respirator to handle both
      the fine wood particulates and volatile organic compounds. Maintain a 2.5 J/cm²
      fluence to minimize charring and fire risk.
    question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning cedar, particularly
      regarding fumes and particulates?
  - answer: Proper laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence opens cedar's surface porosity,
      enhancing coating adhesion. This creates an ideal, contaminant-free substrate
      that doesn't require immediate sealing but should be coated within a standard
      preparation window for optimal bond strength.
    question: Does laser cleaning cedar create surface conditions that require immediate
      re-sealing or protective coating?
  - answer: Laser cleaning preserves cedar's delicate patina far better than abrasive
      methods. Our 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold selectively removes contaminants without
      harming the wood grain, making it ideal for intricate carvings where sanding
      would destroy original surface details.
    question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sanding, chemical
      strippers) for restoring antique cedar furniture?
  - answer: Yes, laser systems effectively remove biological growth from cedar shakes
      using 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This near-infrared wavelength at 1064 nm ablates moss
      and lichen while minimizing heat penetration into the wood's porous structure,
      preventing damage.
    question: Can laser systems effectively remove biological growth (moss, algae,
      lichen) from cedar roofs without damaging the shakes?
  - answer: Severely degraded cedar with compromised structural integrity poses a
      significant risk. At our standard 2.5 J/cm² fluence, friable wood fibers may
      be ablated, causing surface loss. For wood where the substrate itself is the
      contaminant, mechanical methods are often more appropriate to preserve the remaining
      sound material.
    question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily weathered or
      degraded cedar surfaces?
  - answer: Cedar's variable density between earlywood and latewood requires precise
      fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to avoid differential etching along the grain.
      Knotty areas demand lower power settings than clear vertical grain to prevent
      charring, while a 500 mm/s scan speed helps manage this heterogeneity for uniform
      cleaning.
    question: How does cedar's density and grain pattern affect laser cleaning efficiency
      and results?
