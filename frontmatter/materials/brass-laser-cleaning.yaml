caption:
  before: Microscopic examination of the untreated brass surface reveals meticulous evidence of heavy contamination from atmospheric oxidation and particulate dirt, forming a dull, tarnished layer. Visible degradation includes pitting and micro-cracks across the alloy grains, with irregular discoloration and embedded debris compromising the craftsmanship of the metallic luster and structural integrity.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy reveals a restored brass surface, achieved with meticulous removal of contaminants, unveiling a smooth, polished finish of refined elegance. Material integrity remains intact, exhibiting uniform grain structure without ablation damage, enhanced reflectivity, and minimal residual pitting for optimal precision in surface condition.
