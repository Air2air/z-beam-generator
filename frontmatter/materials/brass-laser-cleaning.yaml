caption:
  before: A scanning electron micrograph of an uncleaned brass surface unveils a remarkably
    thick, heterogeneous corrosion layer, featuring verdigris patina, cuprite crystals,
    and malachite deposits. Notably, it displays pronounced pitting, micro-cracks,
    and irregular degradation textures indicative of oxidative damage.
  after: Post-laser cleaning optical microscopy image reveals an elegantly restored
    brass surface, boasting uniform metallic sheen alongside notably minimal residual
    ablation pits under 1 μm, intact grain boundaries, and preserved alloy microstructure—evidencing
    precise contaminant removal without material integrity loss or thermal distortion.
faq:
- question: How does laser cleaning remove tarnish from brass?
  answer: Laser cleaning uses short, controlled pulses of light to vaporize dirt,
    oxide layers, and tarnish on brass surfaces without damaging the underlying metal,
    restoring its shine quickly and effectively.
- question: What benefits does laser cleaning offer for brass musical instruments?
  answer: Laser cleaning preserves the acoustic integrity of brass instruments by
    gently removing buildup and corrosion, enhances longevity without chemicals, and
    maintains the original patina for optimal sound quality and appearance.
- question: Can laser cleaning safely restore antique brass without causing damage?
  answer: Yes, when performed with precision parameters, laser cleaning is non-abrasive
    and non-contact, avoiding scratches or heat distortion on delicate antiques; it
    targets only contaminants like tarnish or grime, preserving historical value while
    addressing oxidation and buildup issues common in aged brass, often outperforming
    traditional methods in safety and efficiency.
