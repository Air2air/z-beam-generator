caption:
  before: Microscopy of the contaminated Ruthenium surface reveals fine dust particles
    and oily residues adhering to it, notably forming uneven spots. Renowned for its
    durability, this metal now shows light discoloration and tiny pits arising from
    oxidation and handling wear. Contaminants dull its shine while adding roughness,
    thus hindering cleaning performance in optics. Treatment strips away these layers,
    restoring smoothness.
  after: The laser-cleaned ruthenium surface notably displays a smooth, reflective
    finish, free from residues and contaminants. This particularly indicates high
    restoration quality, fully maintaining the metal's integrity and vital properties
    for standard cleaning applications.

faq:
- answer: Notably, for ruthenium-coated mirrors, the 1064 nm near-IR laser wavelength
    excels in oxide removal at 2.3 J/cm² fluence. It minimizes delamination by targeting
    the thin film's absorption, thus preventing substrate harm. The 532 nm green light
    serves as an alternative, but specifically demands stricter pulse control to preserve
    coating adhesion. This method achieves uniform cleaning across two passes at 500
    mm/s scan speed.
  question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning ruthenium-coated
    mirrors without causing delamination?
  topic_keyword: causing delamination
  topic_statement: 1064 nm minimizes delamination
- answer: Ruthenium shows high reflectivity, particularly 70-90% across visible and
    IR ranges, which scatters substantial laser energy on optical surfaces and hinders
    absorption, thereby reducing cleaning efficiency. Address this challenge using
    a 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 2.3 J/cm² fluence, thus improving targeted
    oxide removal while preventing bulk damage.
  question: How does ruthenium's high reflectivity affect the efficiency of laser
    cleaning processes on optical surfaces?
  topic_keyword: high reflectivity
  topic_statement: Impedes absorption, slows efficiency
- answer: Pulsed laser cleaning of ruthenium alloys at 1064 nm can trigger ruthenium
    oxide formation, particularly when fluence exceeds 2.3 J/cm², thus releasing potentially
    toxic vapors. Airborne nanoparticles from ablation pose inhalation hazards, so
    adhere to OSHA ventilation standards using local exhaust systems to capture fines
    under 50 μm spot size.
  question: Are there specific safety risks when using pulsed lasers to remove contaminants
    from ruthenium alloys in semiconductor manufacturing?
- answer: For laser cleaning of ruthenium thin films, target pulse fluences below
    1 J/cm² to avoid thermal damage to underlying substrates. Specifically at 1064
    nm with 8 ns pulses, this threshold enables selective oxide ablation while curbing
    heat buildup—thus, apply interferometry for real-time surface monitoring.
  question: What pulse energy levels should be used to avoid thermal damage when laser
    cleaning ruthenium thin films on substrates?
  topic_keyword: ruthenium thin films
  topic_statement: fluences below 1 J/cm²
- answer: To protect ruthenium catalysts against reactions with surface impurities
    during laser cleaning, conduct the process under an inert argon atmosphere, specifically
    at 1064 nm wavelength and 2.3 J/cm² fluence, for precise oxide removal. Then,
    passivate the surface via controlled exposure, thus forming a protective layer
    that curbs its high catalytic reactivity.
  question: In laser cleaning of ruthenium catalysts, how can we prevent chemical
    reactions with residual surface impurities?
- answer: Femtosecond lasers, particularly via precise non-thermal ablation, effectively
    remove ruthenium residues, producing minimal heat-affected zones and enhanced
    surface integrity compared to nanosecond systems. These ns systems frequently
    induce thermal damage or incomplete cleaning at 2.3 J/cm² fluence. Notably, electronics
    case studies demonstrate fs's cleaner outcomes, yet with 20-30% slower rates than
    ns at 50 kHz repetition.
  question: What are the common issues with residue removal on ruthenium surfaces
    using femtosecond lasers versus nanosecond lasers?
  topic_keyword: residue removal on ruthenium
  topic_statement: Femtosecond enables non-thermal ablation
- answer: Notably, ruthenium's high melting point of 2334°C enables laser powers near
    45 W for jewelry cleaning, vaporizing surface oxides while avoiding base material
    fusion. Its moderate thermal conductivity thus requires precise fluence control
    at 2.3 J/cm² to avoid heat buildup and keep contaminant removal superficial.
  question: How does ruthenium's melting point influence the choice of laser power
    for surface treatment in jewelry applications?
  topic_keyword: ruthenium's melting point
  topic_statement: Allows 45 W without fusion
- answer: When managing ruthenium dust produced by laser cleaning, adherence to EPA
    standards for toxic metal waste is crucial, designating it as hazardous for safe
    disposal while capping airborne exposure at under 0.1 mg/m³ per OSHA PEL. Particularly
    under REACH, EU operators must register ruthenium particulates and ensure ventilation
    during 2.3 J/cm² fluence operations, thus reducing inhalation hazards in electronics
    or aerospace settings.
  question: What regulatory standards apply to handling ruthenium dust generated during
    laser cleaning in industrial settings?
  topic_keyword: handling ruthenium dust
  topic_statement: Classifies as hazardous toxic waste
- answer: Yes, laser cleaning notably restores ruthenium-coated EUV lithography mirrors,
    recovering reflectivity above 95% at 13.5 nm following contamination. Specifically,
    a 1064 nm wavelength with 2.3 J/cm² fluence and 45 W power ablates oxides cleanly
    without substrate damage, thus preserving low surface roughness per ASML protocols.
  question: Can laser cleaning restore the optical properties of ruthenium-coated
    EUV lithography mirrors after contamination?
