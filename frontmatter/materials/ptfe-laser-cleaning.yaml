title: PTFE Laser Cleaning
name: PTFE
settings_description: When laser cleaning PTFE, watch its low friction right away.
  I've seen it slide under the beam too easily, so secure the part firmly first. This
  works best with short, low-energy pulses. They clear contaminants without melting
  the surface, unlike with softer plastics that warp faster. PTFE holds up better
  to heat than most thermoplastics, keeping its slick finish intact. Tends to absorb
  energy evenly, restoring the non-stick quality cleanly. Avoid steady beams—they
  overheat and degrade it quickly. Just pulse gently, and you'll bring back that smooth
  glide every time.
material_description: When laser cleaning PTFE, I've found you start with gentle pulses
  to leverage its remarkable heat resistance that keeps the material intact far beyond
  typical plastics, restoring surfaces smoothly in chemical-heavy industries but always
  monitor for any subtle warping at the edges

  before: When examining the contaminated PTFE surface at 1000x magnification, you
    see dirt particles scattered across the uneven texture. Residues cling tightly
    to the rough patches, making the whole area look cluttered and irregular. This
    buildup hides the material's natural smoothness under a layer of grime.
  after: After laser treatment, the PTFE surface at 1000x magnification appears clear
    and even throughout. No traces of dirt remain on the now-polished texture, restoring
    its original clean look. You notice the material
