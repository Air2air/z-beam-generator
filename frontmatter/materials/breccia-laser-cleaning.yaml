caption:
  before: Optical microscopy of the untreated Breccia stone surface reveals dense
    accumulation of carbonaceous soot, silica particulates, and biological encrustations,
    manifesting as irregular layering and voids. Accompanying degradation includes
    surface pitting, micro-fissures, and localized discoloration, evidencing prolonged
    exposure to atmospheric pollutants and mechanical abrasion, compromising the heterogeneous
    clast-matrix structure.
  after: Scanning electron microscopy post-laser cleaning illustrates the Breccia
    surface with exceptional restoration, exhibiting complete ablation of contaminants
    and exposure of the pristine angular clasts embedded in the fine-grained calcareous
    matrix. Surface topography displays uniform micro-relief with negligible thermal
    alteration, preserved binder integrity, and enhanced clarity of mineral boundaries,
    affirming optimal material conservation and structural fidelity without subsurface
    damage or residue persistence.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How can I safely remove rust stains from Breccia surfaces without harming
      the natural patina?
    answer: Employ precise laser ablation to vaporize oxidation layers selectively,
      preserving underlying textures and colors. This non-contact method avoids mechanical
      abrasion, ensuring structural integrity remains intact during the process. (24
      words)
  - question: What are the best practices for maintaining Breccia in outdoor architectural
      features?
    answer: Schedule regular inspections to monitor moisture retention in porous areas,
      applying protective sealants annually to mitigate absorption issues. Combine
      with gentle dry brushing for surface debris removal. (25 words)
  - question: Is laser cleaning effective for Breccia used in heritage restoration
      projects?
    answer: Laser technology excels by targeting contaminants at the surface level
      without penetrating the fragile cementation, unlike abrasive techniques that
      risk fragment displacement. It maintains historical authenticity while enhancing
      visual appeal through even cleaning. (32 words)
  - question: How does differential weathering affect Breccia countertops, and what
      can be done?
    answer: Variations in clast durability lead to uneven erosion over time, creating
      rough patches. Utilize controlled laser treatments to smooth discrepancies gently,
      promoting uniform resistance to further environmental degradation without compromising
      overall strength. (29 words)
  - question: Why is Breccia prone to staining in urban environments, and how to prevent
      it?
    answer: The matrix's openness allows pollutant infiltration, causing discoloration
      from acidic exposures. Opt for hydrophobic coatings post-installation and periodic
      laser decontamination to eliminate residues, safeguarding the material's variegated
      patterns and longevity. (30 words)
  - question: What advantages does laser cleaning offer over traditional methods for
      Breccia sculptures?
    answer: Unlike chemical solvents that may seep into pores and cause etching, or
      mechanical tools risking clast loosening, laser cleaning provides precise, dry
      removal of grime. It preserves textural depth and compressive robustness, ideal
      for delicate artistic elements in landscaping. (41 words)
  - question: Can Breccia flooring handle heavy foot traffic, and how to clean it
      routinely?
    answer: Its robust bonding supports loads up to 200 MPa, but accumulated dirt
      exacerbates porosity concerns. Recommend vacuuming followed by low-power laser
      passes to dislodge particles efficiently, avoiding water-based methods that
      promote biological colonization. (33 words)
