title: Scandium Laser Cleaning
name: Scandium
settings_description: When laser cleaning Scandium, I've found it works best with
  short pulses. This targets contaminants without overheating the soft surface. Its
  lightweight nature helps it stay stable during passes. But watch out mid-process—too
  much energy melts the low-hardness base easily. So, keep power low and scan slowly.
  Tends to shine up nicely after, leaving a clean, reflective finish. Avoid continuous
  beams; they cause uneven spots.
