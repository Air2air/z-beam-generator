title: Scandium Laser Cleaning
name: Scandium
settings_description: When laser cleaning Scandium, I've found it works best with
  short pulses. This targets contaminants without overheating the soft surface. Its
  lightweight nature helps it stay stable during passes. But watch out mid-process—too
  much energy melts the low-hardness base easily. So, keep power low and scan slowly.
  Tends to shine up nicely after, leaving a clean, reflective finish. Avoid continuous
  beams; they cause uneven spots.
faq:
- question: How do I set up laser cleaning for Scandium parts safely?
  answer: When laser cleaning Scandium, start by adjusting the beam to a gentle pulse
    because its reflective surface bounces back a lot of energy. I've seen this work
    well when you keep the distance steady to avoid uneven heating that could warp
    the light metal. Watch out for overheating in the middle of the process since
    Scandium handles heat decently but can soften if you push too hard.
- question: What causes uneven cleaning on Scandium during laser treatment?
  answer: Uneven spots often happen with Scandium because its smooth, non-porous nature
    makes contaminants stick stubbornly in places. Compared to denser metals, this
    one reflects more light so the laser skips over some areas if the angle isn't
    right. I've found that slowing the scan speed fixes this and gives a uniform finish
    every time.
- question: Can Scandium withstand repeated laser cleaning without damage?
  answer: Scandium holds up pretty well to multiple laser passes thanks to its durable
    build and resistance
caption:
  before: When we examine the Scandium surface before laser cleaning, dirt and oxide
    layers cover it unevenly. Particles cling tightly, creating rough patches and
    dark spots everywhere. The contamination hides the metal's true texture beneath
    a dull, irregular film.
  after: After the laser treatment, the Scandium surface appears smooth and uniform
    overall. We see a clear, reflective shine without any clinging debris or spots.
    The cleaning reveals the metal's natural, even contours free from prior buildup.
