caption:
  before: Under microscopy, the neodymium surface notably exhibits heavy contamination,
    specifically from oily residues and fine dust particles that cling tightly. This
    rare-earth material shows pitting and light oxidation, thus degrading its smooth
    finish and exposing underlying vulnerabilities.
  after: Laser cleaning effectively restores neodymium surfaces, particularly through
    gentle contaminant removal. The treated surface emerges smooth and uniform, reclaiming
    its inherent luster. Notably, this approach delivers superior restoration while
    upholding material integrity—no cracks or degradation in the rare-earth framework.
    It fits routine cleaning demands effectively.

faq:
- answer: Cleaning neodymium magnets with lasers carries high risks, particularly
    from their intense flammability and the toxic fumes generated by rare earth oxides.
    Specifically, the 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² readily induces demagnetization
    via heat—unlike in safer rust removal. Thus, robust fume extraction and precise
    thermal control are essential to avert ignition.
  question: Is it safe to laser clean neodymium magnets, and what are the specific
    risks?
  topic_keyword: neodymium magnets
  topic_statement: Extreme flammability and demagnetization risk
- answer: For cleaning neodymium components, the 1064 nm wavelength proves optimal,
    particularly due to its strong absorption. Employ a low fluence around 5.1 J/cm²
    paired with high-frequency pulses to remove oxides effectively, while avoiding
    substrate damage. Thus, this method harnesses the material's thermal traits to
    ablate contaminants without excess heat buildup.
  question: What is the best laser wavelength and parameter settings for cleaning
    a neodymium component without damaging it?
  topic_keyword: neodymium component
  topic_statement: Requires 1064 nm low fluence
- answer: Removing Ni-Cu-Ni plating from NdFeB magnets proves extremely challenging,
    particularly since the thermal threshold for magnetic degradation sits at only
    ~150°C. Effective ablation, meanwhile, demands precise fluence control around
    5.1 J/cm². Thus, this high-risk process calls for exceptional thermal management
    to avert irreversible magnetic loss.
  question: Can laser cleaning remove the nickel-copper-nickel plating from a neodymium
    magnet without affecting the magnetic properties?
  topic_keyword: nickel-copper-nickel plating
  topic_statement: Demands exceptional thermal management
- answer: Neodymium's oxidation resistance, notably low at 0.15°C, demands effective
    fume extraction. We apply HEPA/ULPA filtration paired with activated carbon, specifically
    capturing heavy metal aerosols to maintain airborne particulates below 1 mg/m³
    for operator safety.
  question: How do you handle the toxic fumes generated when laser cleaning neodymium
    alloys?
  topic_keyword: toxic fumes
  topic_statement: Low oxidation resistance requires extraction
- answer: The black discoloration stems from surface oxidation during laser heating.
    Neodymium, particularly with its low oxidation resistance of 0.15°C, proves highly
    reactive. This thin oxide layer generally spares magnetic performance. Thus, to
    curb it, apply a lower fluence around 5.1 J/cm² alongside quicker scan speeds.
  question: Why does the surface of a neodymium magnet turn black or discolored after
    laser cleaning?
  topic_keyword: turn black or discolored
  topic_statement: Due to low oxidation resistance
- answer: Neodymium iron boron, particularly its fine particulates, proves pyrophoric
    and ignites spontaneously. We address this hazard through inert argon shielding
    at 1064 nm wavelength, along with rigorous housekeeping practices. Thus, a Class
    D extinguisher remains essential for handling the reactive metal powders produced
    in laser cleaning.
  question: What is the risk of a fire when laser cleaning neodymium, and how is it
    mitigated?
  topic_keyword: risk of a fire
  topic_statement: Pyrophoric; mitigated by argon shielding
- answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² fluence effectively removes contaminants from
    neodymium, notably creating an ideal surface for recoating. Yet, its low oxidation
    resistance of 0.15°C thus demands precise thermal control via 50% beam overlap
    to avoid oxide formation that hinders adhesion.
  question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for preparing neodymium surfaces for
    recoating or re-plating?
- answer: Notably, neodymium's low oxidation resistance means a freshly laser-cleaned
    surface at 5.1 J/cm² will rapidly re-oxidize. Thus, this cleaning step must immediately
    precede protective oil or coating application in a controlled environment to prevent
    corrosion.
  question: How does the high reactivity and corrosion tendency of neodymium affect
    the laser cleaning process and post-cleaning handling?
  topic_keyword: high reactivity
  topic_statement: Requires immediate protective coating
- answer: Pure neodymium demands meticulous cleaning, particularly owing to its 0.265
    HV softness and severe pyrophoricity, necessitating inert atmosphere protection.
    By contrast, NdFeB magnets remain hazardous yet more resilient; their iron alters
    fume profiles and supports slightly elevated fluence up to 5.1 J/cm². Thus, both
    materials carry substantial fire risks in laser operations.
  question: What are the key differences between laser cleaning a pure neodymium metal
    versus a common NdFeB magnet?
  topic_keyword: pure neodymium metal
  topic_statement: requires inert atmosphere shielding
- answer: Although precise 5.1 J/cm² fluence control makes selective rust ablation
    from pinholes theoretically feasible, avoiding damage to intact plating proves
    extremely challenging. Notably, the magnet's low 0.265 HV hardness and 16.5 W/(m·K)
    conductivity increase its vulnerability to thermal harm, thus rendering this method
    impractical for broad corrosion use.
  question: Can laser cleaning be used to selectively remove corrosion (rust) from
    a sintered neodymium magnet without damaging the plating?
  topic_keyword: without damaging the plating
  topic_statement: Highly susceptible to thermal damage
