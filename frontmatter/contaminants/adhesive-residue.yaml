description: Adhesive residue forms tenacious films. It clings to metals and plastics
  so surfaces show persistent tackiness. After exposure, residue hardens and resists
  solvents because bonds hold firmly. Unlike dust that brushes away or oils that evaporate,
  this contamination demands gentle cleaning. Scraping risks damage, so methods apply
  carefully. In observations, it differs from water-based stains that rinse off readily.
