description: Adhesive-residue contamination clings tenaciously to surfaces from tape
  remnants. Before cleaning attempts, sticky layers resist simple wiping, so solvents
  dissolve incompletely and leave bonds intact. Unlike dust that brushes away freely
  or oils that evaporate readily under heat, this residue hardens on metals and plastics,
  causing uneven adhesion during removal. Scraping risks substrate damage, so gentle
  methods are needed.
