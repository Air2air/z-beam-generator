title: adhesive-residue
description: Adhesive-residue contamination differs from dust or oil buildup because
  it forms sticky layers during peeling from surfaces, so removal demands solvents
  or abrasion. On metals, residue bonds tightly and resists wiping, while on plastics,
  it spreads unevenly and softens heat. Challenges arise in complete elimination,
  as traces remain hidden in pores, leading to poor adhesion later. After cleaning,
  surfaces exhibit uniformity, but repeated exposure causes recurrence.
