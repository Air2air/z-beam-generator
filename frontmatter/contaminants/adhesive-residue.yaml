title: adhesive-residue
description: Adhesive-residue contamination forms sticky layers from tape or glue
  remnants, and it clings tenaciously to surfaces. Before removal attempts, buildup
  resists wiping, so solvents often fail to dissolve it completely. Unlike dust that
  brushes away easily or oils that evaporate under heat, this residue bonds strongly
  to metals and plastics, causing uneven adhesion during cleaning. Challenges arise
  because scraping damages substrates, so careful mechanical methods apply in observations.
