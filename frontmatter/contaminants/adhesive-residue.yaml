description: Adhesive-residue contamination occurs when sticky remnants from tapes
  or glues cling to surfaces during manufacturing. This buildup differs from dust
  or oil contaminants because it forms tenacious bonds, especially on plastics and
  metals, and resists simple wiping. On metals, residue spreads thinly and hardens,
  while on polymers, it embeds deeply so removal risks surface damage. Challenges
  arise during cleaning, as solvents dissolve the adhesive but may etch underlying
  materials, so gentle methods like abrasion apply carefully. In observations, this
  pattern demands targeted treatments for effective decontamination.
