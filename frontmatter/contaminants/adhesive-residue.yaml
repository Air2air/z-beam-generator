description: Adhesive residue contamination arises from leftover glue and tape marks
  on surfaces. It forms sticky layers that bond tightly to materials like metals and
  plastics. On glass, residue spreads unevenly so cleaning becomes tricky. This pattern
  clings because of its chemical hold, and it yellows over time during exposure. Removal
  challenges include avoiding substrate damage, so laser treatment applies gentle
  pulses. Process targets residue without scratching, and surfaces regain smoothness
  after.
