description: Adhesive residue forms when tapes or labels peel away from surfaces.
  This leaves sticky films behind. On metals, it clings tightly and resists wiping.
  Plastics show uneven buildup so cleaning risks scratches. Glass surfaces attract
  dust to the residue, making spots worse. Challenges arise because solvents harm
  substrates. Laser cleaning targets residue precisely. After treatment, surfaces
  regain smoothness. Process applies heat briefly, so no damage occurs.
