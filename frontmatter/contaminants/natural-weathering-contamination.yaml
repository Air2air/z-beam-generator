title: Natural Weathering Contamination
contamination_description: Natural weathering contamination, it manifests as a heterogeneous
  layer of degradation products, which forms through prolonged exposure to ultraviolet
  radiation, moisture fluctuations, thermal stresses, and oxidative processes that
  vary regionally, influenced from climatic patterns in Mediterranean zones. This
  contamination, it distinguishes itself from industrial pollutants by its uneven
  distribution dependent from surface orientation, exhibiting tenacious adhesion on
  metals like steel and copper, where it promotes patina-like oxidation, while on
  porous stones such as limestone or wood like oak, it induces cracking and discoloration
  that demonstrates material-specific vulnerability. The challenges for removal lie
  in its deep integration without damaging substrates, yet laser cleaning proves effective,
  as the process selectively ablates these layers through precise energy absorption,
  which preserves underlying integrity.

  before: Surface shows natural weathering and aging from environmental exposure.
  after: Post-cleaning reveals restored surface with weathering effects removed through
    laser ablation.
context_notes: Natural weathering from UV, moisture cycling, thermal stress, and oxidation.
  Distribution varies significantly by surface orientation.
