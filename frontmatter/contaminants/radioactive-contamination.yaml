title: Surface Radioactive Contamination Contamination
contamination_description: Radioactive contamination, it consists of low-level particle
  deposits arising from nuclear processes or environmental exposure, which manifest
  as adherent layers that emit alpha or beta radiation, distinguishing themselves
  from chemical contaminants through their persistent isotopic signatures and minimal
  visibility under standard inspection. On materials such as stainless steel or concrete,
  these deposits behave tenaciously, embedding into porous surfaces or forming oxide
  bonds on metals like copper and titanium, influenced from surface roughness that
  complicates uniform adhesion. Key removal challenges include avoiding secondary
  dispersion of particles, yet laser cleaning proves effective, as the pulsed energy
  vaporizes the thin layers selectively without mechanical abrasion, preserving the
  underlying substrate integrity.
