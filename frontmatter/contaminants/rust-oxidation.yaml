description: Rust-oxidation contamination forms through exposure to moisture and oxygen
  on [Iron](../materials/iron.md)-containing surfaces, creating a flaky, reddish layer
  that differs from uniform deposits like dust or oils by its progressive expansion
  and adhesion. On reactive metals such as steel, it penetrates deeply and weakens
  structure, while on inert non-metals like ceramics, it remains superficial and less
  adherent. Formation occurs gradually at joints and scratches, so cleaning targets
  these patterns to restore integrity without further degradation.
