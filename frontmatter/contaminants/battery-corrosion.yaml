description: Battery-corrosion contamination forms via electrolyte reactions in devices.
  This pattern, it penetrates electrodes deeply and accelerates under electrical stress.
  Unlike atmospheric rust on steels, battery type resists oxidation reversal and clings
  to alloys tightly. On metals like [Copper](../materials/copper.md), it builds insulating
  films; on polymers, it induces cracking. Challenges in removal follow, thus demands
  careful dissolution methods.
