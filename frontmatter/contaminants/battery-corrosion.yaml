description: Battery corrosion, it forms from electrolyte leaks and creates crystalline
  deposits. On [Steel](../materials/steel.md) surfaces, this contamination penetrates
  deeply and causes pitting. Aluminum, it behaves differently—spreads thinly yet clings
  tightly. Unique pattern shows irregular salt layers. Removal challenges arise, thus
  laser cleaning must target precisely. Adhesion resists efforts, and residue lingers
  on edges. Treatment applies, surface restores durability. Process yields clean uniformity.
