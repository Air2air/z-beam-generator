description: Battery-corrosion contamination, it arises from electrolyte leaks and
  forms irregular deposits on battery casings. This pattern differs from uniform rust
  in pipes, where oxidation spreads evenly; here, it creates localized pits and conductive
  films that accelerate short circuits. On metals, contamination etches deeply and
  resists solvents, while on plastics, it softens surfaces thus invites cracks. Removal
  challenges persist, as scrubbing damages seals, so gentle wiping follows, yet residues
  still linger in crevices.
