description: Battery-corrosion contamination arises from electrolyte leaks. It targets
  battery casings and electrodes directly. This contamination, it accelerates material
  breakdown and blocks conductivity. Unique behavior shows in selective pitting on
  metals like [Copper](../materials/copper.md), while aluminum resists somewhat. Other
  pollutants, such as moisture or acids, spread evenly across surfaces. Removal proves
  difficult; residues cling tightly and demand harsh cleaners. Thus, maintenance delays
  follow, and efficiency drops steadily.
