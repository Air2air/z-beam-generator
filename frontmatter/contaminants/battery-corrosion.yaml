description: Battery corrosion contamination stems from electrolyte leaks in devices.
  It creates pitting and oxide buildup on metal surfaces. This pattern penetrates
  deeply, weakening casings and disrupting electrical flow. On [Steel](../materials/steel.md)
  components, corrosion spreads unevenly and resists simple wiping. Aluminum parts
  show flaking layers that cling stubbornly. Removal proves tricky—harsh methods risk
  further erosion. Laser cleaning dissolves these contaminants gently. Surface restores
  smoothness and functionality thus.
