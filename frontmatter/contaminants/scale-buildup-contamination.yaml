  after: Post-cleaning reveals restored surface with mineral scale / hard water deposits
    successfully removed through precise laser ablation.
  before: Surface shows contamination from mineral scale / hard water deposits affecting
    material appearance and properties.
category: contamination
context_notes: Common in plumbing, boilers, heat exchangers, and areas with water
  exposure
description: Scale-buildup forms as adherent oxide layers from prolonged heat exposure,
  differing from loose particulates or oily residues by its tenacious bonding to surfaces.
  On reactive metals like [Iron](../materials/iron.md), it creates thick, insulating
  coatings that promote further corrosion underneath, while on inert non-metals such
  as ceramics, layers remain thinner and less disruptive. Formation occurs gradually
  through oxidation, resulting in rough, porous structures. This contamination hinders
  heat transfer on metals and invites cracking on non-metals, so laser cleaning ablates
  it precisely without substrate damage.
