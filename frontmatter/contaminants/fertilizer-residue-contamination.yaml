title: Fertilizer Salt Deposits Contamination
contamination_description: Fertilizer-residue contamination, it arises from nitrate
  and phosphate deposits, which accumulate on surfaces through prolonged exposure
  to agricultural chemicals and environmental moisture, distinguishing itself from
  other residues by its crystalline structure that promotes uneven layering. This
  contamination, it adheres more tenaciously to porous materials like limestone and
  marble, where it penetrates deeply, while on metals such as steel or copper it manifests
  as a thin film that accelerates oxidation, thus posing removal challenges dependent
  from its variable solubility and risk of substrate etching. Laser cleaning exhibits
  effectiveness here, as the process selectively vaporizes the residue without altering
  the underlying material, which leads to efficient restoration that traditional methods
  often fail to achieve.
