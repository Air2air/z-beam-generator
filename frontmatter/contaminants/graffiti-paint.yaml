description: 'Graffiti paint stands out for its aggressive adhesion, forming thick,
  uneven layers that seep into porous materials like [Brick](../materials/brick.md)
  and concrete. This contaminant bonds tightly to metals and glass too, creating a
  glossy, resilient film that resists weathering yet flakes under direct sun. Removal
  poses a significant challenge: traditional methods often damage substrates, but
  laser cleaning cuts through these bonds cleanly, preserving the underlying surface
  without residue. In practice, it delivers a fresh start for affected structures.'
