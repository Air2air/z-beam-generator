description: Graffiti paint sets up quickly on urban surfaces, forming a tough, colorful
  layer that bonds aggressively to porous materials like [Concrete](../materials/concrete.md)
  and brick. Unlike oil-based industrial spills, which wipe off more readily, this
  aerosol-driven contaminant resists basic cleaners and digs into textures, often
  leaving stains behind. On metals or glass, it peels easier but demands solvents
  to avoid scratching. The key challenge? Removal ramps up labor without harming the
  base material—testing shows mild abrasives work out best in most cases.
