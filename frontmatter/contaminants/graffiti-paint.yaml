description: Graffiti paint stands out as a deliberate contaminant that bonds aggressively
  to urban surfaces like [Concrete](../materials/concrete.md), metal, and glass. Unlike
  natural dirt or bird droppings, it penetrates porous materials deeply, while forming
  slick layers on smooth ones, making removal tricky. Teams typically line up solvents
  or abrasives to strip it, yet it often leaves stains that hold up against basic
  cleaning.
