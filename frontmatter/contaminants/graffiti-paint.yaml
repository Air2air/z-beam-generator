description: Graffiti-paint contamination hits urban surfaces hard, spreading quickly
  through aerosol application and bonding tightly to substrates like [Concrete](../materials/concrete.md)
  or metal. Unlike dirt or rust that rinse away with basic pressure washing, this
  paint penetrates porous materials deeply, forming a durable film that resists standard
  cleaners. Removal demands specialized solvents to break it down without etching
  the base, turning out a clean finish in most cases while addressing the key challenge
  of color bleed on varied textures.
