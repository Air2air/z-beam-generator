description: Graffiti paint sets up as a tough, layered contaminant that lines up
  in bold colors from aerosol sprays. It bonds tightly to porous surfaces like [Brick](../materials/brick.md),
  soaking in deep and staining over time, while on smooth metals or glass it forms
  a slick film that resists weathering. Removal poses a significant challenge, as
  traditional methods often damage substrates; laser cleaning, however, clears it
  efficiently without harming the base material.
