description: Adhesive residue contamination consists of organic polymers from tapes
  and labels, so sticky films form on surfaces during manufacturing or shipping after
  these materials are removed. This contamination differs from oily types because
  it shows tacky and uneven buildup that adheres strongly to metals like steel and
  aluminum, while it blends into plastics such as ABS on exposure. During mechanical
  removal, re-adhesion occurs so challenges arise, but laser cleaning vaporizes organics
  selectively and substrates remain undamaged after treatment.
micro:
  before: Adhesive residue contamination poses cleaning challenge because sticky polymers
    bond tightly to surfaces. Before laser treatment, microscopic view reveals uneven
    film layer that clings and distorts substrate texture so removal proves difficult.
    This contaminant differs from other organic residues through its viscoelastic
    tackiness, which allows slow migration under minimal heat and resists mechanical
    wiping unlike dry dusts. After ablation, surface exhibits smooth uniformity and
    no lingering traces. Laser cleaning achieves thorough decontamination so original
    properties restore effectively. Observations confirm process effectiveness in
    removing such tenacious buildup.
