title: Copper Electroplating Contamination
contamination_description: Copper-plating contamination, it manifests as a thin metallic
  layer from electroplating processes or corrosion, which adheres tenaciously to substrates
  like steel and brass, yet peels more readily on plastics such as ABS. This pattern,
  distinguished by its conductive sheen and uniform spread unlike irregular oxide
  deposits, poses challenges in removal due to potential substrate pitting that seems
  dependent from laser intensity. Laser cleaning proves effective, as the contamination
  absorbs energy selectively, leading to precise ablation without excessive heat spread.
