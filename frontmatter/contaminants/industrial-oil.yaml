description: Industrial oil contamination arises in manufacturing settings, where
  lubricants from heavy machinery form persistent films on equipment surfaces. This
  residue, it adheres tenaciously to metals like [Steel](../materials/steel.md) and
  aluminum, penetrating microscopic pores that complicate thorough removal. On non-metallic
  substrates, such as plastics, the oil softens and discolors the material, exacerbating
  degradation over time. Key challenges include its viscous nature, which resists
  mechanical wiping, demanding precise laser ablation to vaporize the layer effectively,
  preserving underlying integrity.
