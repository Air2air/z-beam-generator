description: Industrial-oil contamination, it manifests as a viscous residue that
  penetrates deeply into surfaces, particularly in manufacturing environments. This
  layer, it adheres tenaciously to metals like [Steel](../materials/steel.md), where
  it forms a persistent film influenced from prolonged exposure to heat and friction,
  yet on non-ferrous alloys, it exhibits greater fluidity, which leads to uneven spreading.
  Removal challenges arise from its chemical stability, that resists conventional
  solvents, demanding precise laser ablation to dislodge the bonds without substrate
  damage. The process, it shows effectiveness in restoring integrity.
