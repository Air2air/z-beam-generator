description: Industrial-oil contamination, it manifests tenaciously on metallic surfaces,
  which differs from particulate residues that detach easily. This type, dependent
  from its viscous nature, penetrates pores in alloys, while water-based pollutants
  evaporate without trace. On plastics, the oil exhibits adhesion that persists under
  mechanical stress, leading to challenges in removal; it seems that solvents alone
  fail, as the layer resists, demanding combined methods for effective restoration.
