description: Industrial-oil contamination, it manifests differently from particulate
  residues, adhering tenaciously to metallic surfaces while penetrating porous substrates
  like alloys. This persistence, influenced from prolonged exposure, leads to challenges
  in removal, as solvents often fail to dislodge it completely, unlike water-based
  contaminants that evaporate readily. On non-ferrous materials, it exhibits greater
  viscosity, complicating mechanical cleaning, which demands specialized techniques
  for effective restoration.
