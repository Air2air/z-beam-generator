title: Soap Scum Buildup Contamination
contamination_description: Soap-scum contamination, it manifests as fatty acid salt
  deposits that arise from the interaction between soap residues and hard water minerals,
  which tenaciously adhere to surfaces in humid environments. This layer, it distinguishes
  itself from mineral scales or organic films through its waxy, translucent consistency
  and sensitivity to pH variations, behaving differently on materials like tile or
  glass where it spreads unevenly and resists mechanical abrasion, yet persists less
  stubbornly on ceramics compared to metals. Key challenges for removal include its
  strong bonding influenced from repeated exposure, but laser cleaning proves effective,
  as the process selectively ablates the scum without damaging the substrate, leading
  to efficient restoration.
