title: Copper Patina Laser Cleaning | Complete Removal Guide
description: '[Copper](../materials/copper.md) patina forms a distinctive green oxidation
  layer on copper, setting it apart from broader rust patterns on iron or aluminum.
  It arises from air and moisture exposure, building a tight, protective film that
  contaminates by adhering unevenly. On reactive metals, it spreads and bonds deeply,
  accelerating corrosion beneath. Inert metals resist buildup, while non-metals show
  loose flaking and staining. This embedding poses cleaning hurdles, as it clings
  to pores and risks surface etching during removal.'

      >60% continuous crust'
    description: Copper patina forms as blue-green crystalline deposits that adhere
      to ceramic surfaces, particularly in unglazed areas and surface imperfections.
      On glazed ceramics, it appears as surface staining, while on porous bodies like
      terracotta it penetrates deeply. The contamination creates a crusty texture
      that contrasts with the smooth ceramic surface.
    distribution_patterns: Follows surface imperfections and porosity, accumulates
      in low areas and joints
    edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and imperfections, centers remain cleaner
      on glazed surfaces
    geometry_effects: Enhanced in carved details, rough textures, and complex shapes;
      minimal on smooth, glazed surfaces
    gravity_influence: Vertical streaking evident, accumulation in lower sections
      and drainage paths

      surface imperfections and along fiber boundaries. The contamination typically
      follows the composite microstructure, creating patterned discoloration that
      highlights the material's internal structure. On fiberglass, it may penetrate
      between fibers, while on carbon fiber it remains superficial.
    distribution_patterns: Follows composite microstructure, accumulates in surface
      imperfections and along edges
    edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and surface imperfections, then spreads following
      composite structure

      with merging, Heavy: >60% continuous crust'
    description: Copper patina appears as blue-green crystalline deposits that accumulate
      in stone pores and surface imperfections. On porous stones like limestone, it
      penetrates deeply, while on dense stones like granite it forms surface crusts.
      The contamination creates a mottled appearance that contrasts with the natural
      stone color.
    distribution_patterns: Follows natural stone porosity, accumulates in surface
      depressions and along joints
    edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and joints initially, then spreads across
      surface following porosity patterns
