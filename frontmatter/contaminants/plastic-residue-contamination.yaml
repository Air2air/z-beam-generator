  title: Degraded Polymer Deposits Contamination
  contamination_description: Plastic-residue contamination, it manifests as melted,
    degraded, or oxidized layers from heat exposure or UV degradation, which distinguishes
    itself from inorganic rusts by its viscoelastic, non-brittle nature that clings
    irregularly. On metals such as steel and aluminum, the residue adheres tenaciously,
    influenced from surface porosity, while on glass it spreads thinly yet persistently,
    leading to challenges in removal due to its thermal sensitivity and potential
    for re-melting during cleaning. Laser cleaning proves effective, as the process
    vaporizes the residue selectively, that demonstrates preservation of the substrate
    integrity without mechanical abrasion.
