    - Aluminum serves as a non-ferrous metal in various industrial settings. Its lightweight
      nature supports applications in aerospace and automotive sectors. The material
      reduces overall weight in structural components without compromising strength.
      Corrosion resistance improves longevity in marine and construction environments.
      Electrical conductivity enables efficient performance in electronics manufacturing.
      The metal restores flexibility in designs requiring formability, such as packaging
      and renewable energy structures. Oxidation resistance protects surfaces during
      exposure to elevated temperatures in food and beverage processing. In rail transport
      settings, aluminum reveals durability under repeated stress. Adjustments to
      processing parameters enhance surface finish and reduce internal stresses. Optimal
      ranges for forming operations minimize defects and improve material integrity.

    - thermal_management:
      - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
        severity: medium
        property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
        impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
        solutions:
        - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
        - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
        - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
      - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
        severity: high
        threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
        impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
        solutions:
        - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
        - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
        - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
      surface_characteristics:
      - challenge: High reflectivity
        severity: high
        reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
        impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
        solutions:
        - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
        - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
        - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
        - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
      - challenge: Surface finish variations
        severity: medium
        impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
        solutions:
        - Adjust power based on surface condition
        - Test parameters on similar finish samples
        - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
      contamination_challenges:
      - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
        severity: medium
        impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than
          base metal
        solutions:
        - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
        - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
        - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
      - challenge: Oil and grease removal
        severity: low
        impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
        solutions:
        - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
        - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
        - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
