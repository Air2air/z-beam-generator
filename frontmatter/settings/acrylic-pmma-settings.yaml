material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    challenge_id: low_melting_degradation_temperatures
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    challenge_id: outgassing_and_fume_generation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
    challenge_id: variable_absorption_by_color_and_additives
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
    challenge_id: coating_and_label_removal
