  title: Tungsten Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When we laser clean Tungsten, we typically begin with a thorough surface inspection to spot any contaminants like oxides or residues from its aerospace or nuclear uses. This dense metal holds up well under heat, so we ramp up the laser power gradually to overcome its reflective nature that bounces back much of the beam. We've found that pulsing the laser in short bursts helps the heat spread evenly thanks to its strong thermal conductivity, preventing hot spots on the hard surface. But watch out midway—its resistance to oxidation drops if temperatures climb too high, so adjust the scan speed to avoid unwanted surface changes. We finish with multiple light passes to polish without stressing the material's toughness, ensuring clean results for tooling or electrodes. This approach keeps the Tungsten intact and ready for reuse.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
      severity: medium
      property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
      impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
      solutions:
      - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
      - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
      - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
    - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
      severity: high
      threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
      impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
      solutions:
      - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
      - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
      - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: High reflectivity
      severity: high
      reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
      impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
      solutions:
      - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
      - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
      - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
      - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
    - challenge: Surface finish variations
      severity: medium
      impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
      solutions:
      - Adjust power based on surface condition
      - Test parameters on similar finish samples
      - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base metal
      solutions:
      - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
      - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
      - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
    - challenge: Oil and grease removal
      severity: low
      impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
      solutions:
      - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
      - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
      - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
