material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Crystal lattice damage and doping redistribution
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Above 400-600°C causes dopant migration
    impact: Heat causes permanent alteration of electronic properties and device failure
    solutions:
    - Use ultrashort pulses (picosecond or femtosecond) for minimal heat-affected zone
    - Reduce power by 60-70% compared to structural materials
    - Monitor temperature with IR camera; stop if >150°C surface temperature
    - Nanosecond pulses acceptable only for non-active areas (scribe lines, edges)
  - challenge: Thermal stress and wafer cracking
    severity: high
    property_value: Low fracture toughness 0.75-3.0 MPa·√m
    impact: Thermal gradients cause catastrophic wafer fracture
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling for thick wafers
    - Thin wafers (<200 μm) require substrate backing for thermal management
    - Defocused beam reduces peak temperature gradients
    - Gradual power ramping (start 10W, increase 5W per pass)
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Surface contamination and particulates
    severity: critical
    impact: Sub-micron particles cause device defects and yield loss
    solutions:
    - Class 100 cleanroom environment required
    - Use dry laser cleaning (no liquid assist to avoid residue)
    - Gas assist (nitrogen or argon) blows particles away during cleaning
    - Post-cleaning inspection with particle counter (<0.1 μm detection)
    - Follow with wet chemical clean for critical applications
  - challenge: Native oxide layer removal
    severity: high
    impact: Silicon forms native oxide that must be removed without substrate damage
    solutions:
    - Low power (5-15W) for oxide removal only
    - Multiple gentle passes (3-5 passes at 10W) preferred
    - Hydrogen-rich environment prevents oxide reformation
    - Verify oxide removal with ellipsometry or XPS
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Photoresist and polymer residue removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Organic residues carbonize and become harder to remove
    solutions:
    - First pass 20W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 10W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - UV laser (355nm) more effective for organic materials
    - Oxygen-rich environment aids in organic ablation
    - Post-cleaning oxygen plasma for complete residue removal
