  title: Serpentine Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning Serpentine, you'll want to address its relative softness first. This stone scratches easily compared to harder granites. Start with reduced power to prevent surface pitting. Its low heat spreading means energy stays local. Adjust scan speeds higher to avoid hot spots. Serpentine absorbs laser light well unlike reflective marbles. This speeds removal of dirt but risks quick heating. Use multiple light passes to control buildup. The material's slight porosity holds grime deep. Pre-test on edges reveals weak spots. Overlap beams carefully to restore even texture. Serpentine differs from dense limestones by flexing under stress. Lower fluence helps maintain its natural layers. Watch for cracking in thin sections. Always finish with a cooling interval to reduce thermal shock.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Thermal shock and microcracking
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
      impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal stress
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
      - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
      - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
      - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
      - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
    - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
      severity: high
      threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
      impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
      solutions:
      - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
      - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
      - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
      - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
      - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Weathering and surface degradation
      severity: high
      impact: Aged stone has weaker surface layer more susceptible to damage
      solutions:
      - Reduce power 40-60% for weathered stone vs fresh stone
      - Test on inconspicuous area first
      - Multiple gentle passes (4-6 at 40-60W) preferred
      - Monitor for powdering or flaking; adjust power immediately
      - Heritage conservation requires documentation and testing
    - challenge: Mineral composition heterogeneity
      severity: medium
      impact: Mixed minerals have different absorption and damage thresholds
      solutions:
      - Use moderate power (60-80W) suitable for both light and dark minerals
      - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
      - Avoid dwelling on dark minerals (feldspar, mica) which absorb more energy
      - Quartzite and marble more homogeneous than granite
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Biological growth and deep staining
      severity: medium
      porosity_range: 0.5-25% (sandstone highly porous)
      impact: Algae, lichen, and pollution penetrate deep into porous structure
      solutions:
      - First pass 80W fast (1200 mm/s) for surface growth
      - Second pass 60W slow (700 mm/s) for roots and stains
      - Third pass 40W very slow (400 mm/s) for deep staining
      - Chemical biocide pre-treatment kills roots and reduces laser exposure
      - Dense stones (granite, marble) clean in 1-2 passes vs 3-4 for porous stones
