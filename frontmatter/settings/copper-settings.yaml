title: Copper Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning copper, we've found that starting with gentle pulses works best because its shiny surface bounces back most of the energy, so you get even coverage without wasting shots. This high reflectivity sets it apart from duller metals like iron, meaning we adjust our setup to focus on short, repeated passes that gradually lift dirt and oxides while the metal's strong heat-spreading ability prevents hot spots. But watch out midway—push too hard and the surface can soften unevenly, so we dial back intensity and overlap scans to keep things cool and restore that clean, conductive finish for electronics or plumbing jobs.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
    severity: medium
    property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
    impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
    solutions:
    - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
    - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
    - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
  - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
    impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
    solutions:
    - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
    - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
    - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: High reflectivity
    severity: high
    reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
    impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
    solutions:
    - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
    - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
    - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
    - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
  - challenge: Surface finish variations
    severity: medium
    impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on surface condition
    - Test parameters on similar finish samples
    - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base metal
    solutions:
    - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
    - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
    - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
  - challenge: Oil and grease removal
    severity: low
    impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
    solutions:
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
    - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
