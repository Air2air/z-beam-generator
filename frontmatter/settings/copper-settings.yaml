title: Copper Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning copper, we've found that starting with gentle
  pulses works best because its shiny surface bounces back most of the energy, so
  you get even coverage without wasting shots. This high reflectivity sets it apart
  from duller metals like iron, meaning we adjust our setup to focus on short, repeated
  passes that gradually lift dirt and oxides while the metal's strong heat-spreading
  ability prevents hot spots. But watch out midway—push too hard and the surface can
  soften unevenly, so we dial back intensity and overlap scans to keep things cool
  and restore that clean, conductive finish for electronics or plumbing jobs.

      like surface melting due to its reflectivity absorbing energy unevenly. It helps
      you select parameters that avoid material damage, ensuring efficient oxide removal
      without compromising Copper's integrity. Focus on the narrow green band around
      30-50W and short pulses under 100μs to maximize cleaning effectiveness while
      staying clear of the red boundary where vaporization begins.
  energy_coupling_heatmap:
    title: Energy Coupling Heatmap
    description: This heatmap displays the laser energy coupling efficiency for Copper
      across parameter combinations like power and pulse duration, revealing how its
      high reflectivity limits absorption in most infrared wavelengths unless an oxide
      layer forms. It helps you pinpoint narrow optimal zones—often around 30-50W
      with short pulses—where energy transfer peaks, enabling precise configuration
      to clean contaminants without excessive heat buildup from Copper's superior
      thermal conductivity. Watch for the transition to lower efficiency above 60W,

      safe laser cleaning parameters by steering clear of red high-risk areas, ensuring
      effective oxide removal without damaging the material's ductility or surface
      integrity. For instance, note the narrow green safe band around 30-40W where
      copper's reflectivity allows absorption without excessive localized heating.
