title: Cement Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning cement, the key property to lead with is its brittleness compared to tougher masonry like stone. This makes it prone to cracking under heat, unlike denser bricks that hold up better. I've seen surfaces chip easily if you push too hard. So, start slow with gentle pulses to loosen grime without stressing the matrix. Tends to clean cleanly once you avoid over-heating the pores mid-pass. Adjust overlap minimally to prevent uneven wear.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling and explosive failure
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
    impact: Trapped moisture converts to steam causing explosive surface spalling
    solutions:
    - Test moisture content before cleaning (>5% moisture requires drying)
    - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling for wet materials
    - Reduce power by 50-60% for damp masonry
    - Allow 24-48 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
    - Monitor for popping sounds or surface lifting; stop immediately
  - challenge: Low thermal diffusivity and heat accumulation
    severity: high
    property_value: 0.1-1.0 mm²/s (3-10x slower than metals)
    impact: Heat concentrates in surface layer causing thermal stress
    solutions:
    - Increase cooling time between passes (8-12 seconds)
    - Use low repetition rates (<20 kHz)
    - Defocused beam reduces peak intensity
    - Multiple gentle passes preferred over aggressive single pass
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: High porosity and deep contamination
    severity: high
    porosity_range: 10-25% (brick and concrete highly porous)
    impact: Contaminants penetrate deep into porous structure
    solutions:
    - Multiple progressive passes with power increase (50W → 80W → 100W)
    - Reduce scan speed for deeper penetration (400-600 mm/s)
    - Chemical pre-treatment for biological growth (algae, lichen)
    - Expect 3-5 passes for complete cleaning vs 1-2 for dense materials
  - challenge: Surface heterogeneity and aggregate exposure
    severity: medium
    impact: Mixed composition (cement matrix, aggregates, voids) causes variable absorption
    solutions:
    - Use moderate power (70-90W) suitable for both matrix and aggregates
    - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
    - Monitor for differential ablation; adjust power if aggregates become prominent
    - Aged masonry more challenging than new construction
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Paint and coating removal from porous substrate
    severity: medium
    impact: Paint penetrates into pores requiring deep cleaning without substrate damage
    solutions:
    - First pass 100W fast (1500 mm/s) for surface paint layer
    - Second pass 70W slow (800 mm/s) for paint in pores
    - Third pass 50W very slow (500 mm/s) for residual staining
    - Chemical stripping pre-treatment reduces laser exposure
    - Heritage masonry requires gentler approach (max 60W)
