  title: Breccia Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning Breccia, you'll want to treat it differently from smoother sedimentary stones like limestone, since its fragmented makeup—think angular pebbles bound in a matrix—makes it more prone to uneven energy uptake. Start with gentler power levels to handle that irregularity without chipping the edges. Make sure you overlap scans by at least half the spot size, as the varying density can trap heat in porous spots and lead to micro-cracks if you're too aggressive. Adjust speeds upward on the matrix areas for even contaminant removal, restoring that natural, rugged finish without compromising the stone's modest strength.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Thermal shock and microcracking
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
      impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal stress
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
      - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
      - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
      - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
      - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
    - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
      severity: high
      threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
      impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
      solutions:
      - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
      - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
      - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
      - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
      - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Weathering and surface degradation
      severity: high
      impact: Aged stone has weaker surface layer more susceptible to damage
      solutions:
      - Reduce power 40-60% for weathered stone vs fresh stone
      - Test on inconspicuous area first
      - Multiple gentle passes (4-6 at 40-60W) preferred
      - Monitor for powdering or flaking; adjust power immediately
      - Heritage conservation requires documentation and testing
    - challenge: Mineral composition heterogeneity
      severity: medium
      impact: Mixed minerals have different absorption and damage thresholds
      solutions:
      - Use moderate power (60-80W) suitable for both light and dark minerals
      - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
      - Avoid dwelling on dark minerals (feldspar, mica) which absorb more energy
      - Quartzite and marble more homogeneous than granite
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Biological growth and deep staining
      severity: medium
      porosity_range: 0.5-25% (sandstone highly porous)
      impact: Algae, lichen, and pollution penetrate deep into porous structure
      solutions:
      - First pass 80W fast (1200 mm/s) for surface growth
      - Second pass 60W slow (700 mm/s) for roots and stains
      - Third pass 40W very slow (400 mm/s) for deep staining
      - Chemical biocide pre-treatment kills roots and reduces laser exposure
      - Dense stones (granite, marble) clean in 1-2 passes vs 3-4 for porous stones
