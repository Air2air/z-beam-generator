material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Matrix degradation and delamination
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Polymer matrix 150-350°C, ceramic matrix >1000°C
    impact: Heat causes matrix decomposition, fiber-matrix debonding, and layer separation
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 5-10 second cooling for polymer-matrix composites
    - Reduce power by 40-50% compared to monolithic materials
    - Monitor for discoloration, bubbling, or layer lifting
    - Ceramic and metal-matrix composites tolerate higher power
  - challenge: Anisotropic thermal properties
    severity: high
    property_value: 10-100x variation parallel vs perpendicular to fibers
    impact: Heat conducts rapidly along fibers but poorly across layers
    solutions:
    - Scan parallel to fiber direction for best heat dissipation
    - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) to identify fiber orientation
    - Increase cooling time 2-3x when scanning perpendicular to fibers
    - Carbon fiber composites require special attention due to electrical conductivity
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Fiber exposure and damage
    severity: high
    impact: Aggressive cleaning exposes or damages reinforcing fibers
    solutions:
    - Use low energy density (0.5-2 J/cm²) to protect matrix
    - Multiple gentle passes preferred over single aggressive pass
    - Stop immediately if fibers become visible
    - Fiber-rich surfaces (woven cloth) more sensitive than particle-filled
  - challenge: Surface finish variability
    severity: medium
    impact: Gel coat, paint, or protective layers alter absorption and damage threshold
    solutions:
    - Test on edge or hidden area first
    - Coated surfaces may require 50-100W initial pass for coating removal
    - Bare composite requires 30-50% lower power
    - Adjust parameters when transitioning between coated and uncoated areas
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Resin-based contaminant removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives, sealants, and coatings chemically bond to matrix
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 50W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - Chemical pre-treatment improves results for stubborn adhesives
    - Monitor for matrix damage; stop if surface texture changes
settings_description: When laser cleaning rubber, you'll want to begin with the lowest
  possible power settings to account for its exceptional flexibility and low heat
  tolerance. This material absorbs laser energy quickly due to its dark surface properties,
  which allows contaminants to remove effectively without deep penetration into the
  base layer. Rubber's elasticity means it deforms under heat rather than cracking,
  so you must control scan speeds to prevent warping during multiple passes. We've
  found that short pulses restore surface integrity while exposing underlying fibers
  cleanly. Make sure you monitor for signs of softening, as excessive energy reduces
  durability and leads to material breakdown—always test on a small area first to
  adjust accordingly.
