title: soda-lime-glass-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning soda-lime glass, unlike more heat-resistant borosilicates, you must prioritize its quick thermal expansion to avoid cracks. Start with low energy pulses for safe contaminant removal. This everyday glass stays brittle under uneven heating, so keep passes short and overlap minimally midway through. You should always cool the surface between shots—it prevents shattering while clearing buildup effectively.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Thermal shock and catastrophic failure
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: ΔT > 40-100°C rapid cooling (glass-dependent)
    impact: Glass shatters from thermal gradients due to low thermal expansion and brittleness
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 5-8 second cooling between passes
    - Preheat substrate to room temperature before cleaning
    - Avoid cold spots (air vents, cold backing) during processing
    - Tempered glass more resistant but still susceptible to thermal shock
    - Monitor for stress fractures; stop immediately if cracks appear
    challenge_id: thermal_shock_and_catastrophic_failure
  - challenge: Low thermal diffusivity
    severity: high
    property_value: 0.01-15 mm²/s (most glasses 0.5-1.0 mm²/s)
    impact: Heat accumulates in localized zones creating thermal gradients
    solutions:
    - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
    - Increase scan speed to distribute heat (1000-2000 mm/s)
    - Use defocused beam to spread energy over larger area
    - Optical-grade glass (fused silica) tolerates higher power
    challenge_id: low_thermal_diffusivity
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Surface defects and stress concentrators
    severity: high
    impact: Scratches, chips, and inclusions dramatically lower damage threshold
    solutions:
    - Inspect surface with magnification before cleaning
    - Reduce power 40-50% for scratched or damaged glass
    - Clean around defects with extreme caution
    - Polished optical glass requires different parameters than rough architectural glass
    challenge_id: surface_defects_and_stress_concentrators
  - challenge: Coating and film removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Thin films, anti-reflective coatings, and tints have different damage thresholds than substrate
    solutions:
    - Test on edge first to determine coating removal threshold
    - Coated glass may require 40-60W initial pass
    - Bare glass requires 20-30% lower power after coating removal
    - AR coatings very sensitive - use 30-40W maximum
    challenge_id: coating_and_film_removal
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Adhesive and paint removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Thick coatings require multiple passes and generate debris that can scratch glass
    solutions:
    - First pass 60W fast (1800 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 40W slow (1000 mm/s) for residue
    - Use air assist to blow debris away from surface
    - Chemical pre-treatment reduces laser exposure time
    - Avoid dragging ablated material across clean areas
