material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Thermal shock and microcracking
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
    impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal stress
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
    - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
    - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
    - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
    - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
  - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
    severity: high
    threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
    impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
    solutions:
    - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
    - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
    - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
    - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
    - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Weathering and surface degradation
    severity: high
    impact: Aged stone has weaker surface layer more susceptible to damage
    solutions:
    - Reduce power 40-60% for weathered stone vs fresh stone
    - Test on inconspicuous area first
    - Multiple gentle passes (4-6 at 40-60W) preferred
    - Monitor for powdering or flaking; adjust power immediately
    - Heritage conservation requires documentation and testing
  - challenge: Mineral composition heterogeneity
    severity: medium
    impact: Mixed minerals have different absorption and damage thresholds
    solutions:
    - Use moderate power (60-80W) suitable for both light and dark minerals
    - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
    - Avoid dwelling on dark minerals (feldspar, mica) which absorb more energy
    - Quartzite and marble more homogeneous than granite
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Biological growth and deep staining
    severity: medium
    porosity_range: 0.5-25% (sandstone highly porous)
    impact: Algae, lichen, and pollution penetrate deep into porous structure
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1200 mm/s) for surface growth
    - Second pass 60W slow (700 mm/s) for roots and stains
    - Third pass 40W very slow (400 mm/s) for deep staining
    - Chemical biocide pre-treatment kills roots and reduces laser exposure
    - Dense stones (granite, marble) clean in 1-2 passes vs 3-4 for porous stones
