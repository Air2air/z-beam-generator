material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
    severity: medium
    property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
    impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
    solutions:
    - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
    - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
    - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
  - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
    impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
    solutions:
    - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
    - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
    - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: High reflectivity
    severity: high
    reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
    impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
    solutions:
    - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
    - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
    - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
    - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
  - challenge: Surface finish variations
    severity: medium
    impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on surface condition
    - Test parameters on similar finish samples
    - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base
      metal
    solutions:
    - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
    - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
    - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
  - challenge: Oil and grease removal
    severity: low
    impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
    solutions:
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
    - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
settings_description: 'When laser cleaning lead, watch its tendency to melt easily.
  Start with very low power right away. I''ve seen surfaces puddle if you push too
  hard.


  This works when you keep pulses short and focused. Lead''s softness means it responds
  quickly to heat. So, gentle passes bring back the shine without damage.


  Tends to reflect a lot of laser energy too. That makes cleaning slower than on darker
  metals. Adjust by overlapping scans a bit more.


  Its density holds heat in spots, so move the beam steadily. I''ve found this prevents
  warping on thin pieces.


  Avoid rushing with high speed. Lead can smear or oxidize if you do. Instead, do
  multiple light passes. That clears rust and grime safely, especially on old roofing
  or shields. In my experience, it restores heritage items perfectly this way.'
