title: pet-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning PET, you must start with the lowest possible power settings to avoid quick melting, as this thermoplastic softens much faster than sturdier plastics like PVC. Unlike metals that reflect energy and stay cool, PET absorbs just enough to heat evenly, so it demands precise control to prevent warping. Make sure you use short pulses and keep the beam moving steadily—this clears surface grime without damaging the smooth, non-porous base underneath. Watch for any yellowing early on, and dial back energy if you see it, because PET's strength holds up well under stress but not repeated heat exposure. Adjust scan speed higher for thicker buildup to maintain even cleaning.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    challenge_id: low_melting_degradation_temperatures
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    challenge_id: outgassing_and_fume_generation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
    challenge_id: variable_absorption_by_color_and_additives
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
    challenge_id: coating_and_label_removal
