title: Polyvinyl Chloride Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning polyvinyl chloride, you must watch its low heat tolerance right from the start—it's a thermoplastic that softens quickly under intense energy, leading to warping or melting if you're not careful. This makes it different from metals, where heat spreads out fast; here, the energy stays localized because it doesn't conduct heat well, so you risk damaging the surface before buildup even clears. Start with reduced power to build up gradually, and keep scan speeds high to limit exposure time on any spot. You'll find it absorbs laser light readily, which helps remove contaminants efficiently without much reflection loss, but always test on a small area first to avoid pitting. For best results, use multiple light passes with good overlap, letting it cool between them—this restores the smooth finish on pipes or panels without compromising its corrosion resistance or flexibility.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
