material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Rapid oxidation and pyrophoricity
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Above 150-300°C causes spontaneous ignition in air
    impact: Rare-earth metals oxidize rapidly forming insulating oxide layer; fine particles pyrophoric
    solutions:
    - Process in inert atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) or high vacuum
    - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling to prevent sustained heating
    - Keep surface temperature below 150°C monitored with IR camera
    - Have fire suppression ready for pyrophoric materials
    - Immediate passivation after cleaning to prevent further oxidation
  - challenge: Variable thermal properties across series
    severity: medium
    property_value: 3-8 mm²/s thermal diffusivity (2.7x variation)
    impact: Different lanthanides require different cooling strategies
    solutions:
    - Light lanthanides (La, Ce, Pr) require more cooling time
    - Heavy lanthanides (Dy, Er, Yb) tolerate slightly higher power
    - Adjust parameters by specific element, not just category
    - Test on small area to determine optimal cooling requirements
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Oxide layer formation and removal
    severity: high
    impact: Surface oxidizes within seconds to minutes forming opaque layer
    solutions:
    - Clean in controlled atmosphere to prevent immediate reoxidation
    - Multiple passes may be required as oxide reforms between passes
    - Oxide removal threshold (1-3 J/cm²) lower than metal substrate (2-5 J/cm²)
    - Chemical passivation immediately after cleaning
    - Store in inert atmosphere or vacuum after processing
  - challenge: Magnetic property sensitivity
    severity: high
    impact: Heating above Curie temperature permanently alters magnetic properties
    solutions:
    - Monitor temperature strictly; Nd magnets lose magnetism above 310-400°C
    - Use ultrashort pulses (picosecond) for minimal heat-affected zone
    - Reduce power by 60-70% compared to non-magnetic metals
    - Test magnetic properties before and after cleaning to verify preservation
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: High-value material recovery
    severity: medium
    impact: Rare-earth elements extremely valuable; contamination removal must preserve material
    solutions:
    - First pass 15W very slow (500 mm/s) for assessment
    - Gradual power increase (15W → 25W → 35W) across multiple passes
    - Collect all ablated material for potential recovery
    - Document process for traceability and quality control
    - Consider chemical pre-treatment to reduce laser exposure
  - challenge: Strategic material handling requirements
    severity: medium
    impact: Export-controlled materials require documentation and secure handling
    solutions:
    - Clean in controlled access facility
    - Document all processing parameters and material quantities
    - Secure storage of cleaned materials
    - Follow applicable export control regulations
    - Chain of custody documentation for high-value materials
