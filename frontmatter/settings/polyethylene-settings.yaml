  title: Polyethylene Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: The key with Polyethylene lies in its flexibility compared to stiffer plastics like PVC—it absorbs laser energy well without cracking, making surface buildup easy to remove. I've seen it restore food packaging finishes smoothly. But watch out mid-process; its low heat tolerance can cause softening if you dwell too long. Keep scans quick and light to avoid distortion, bringing back that clean, glossy look every time.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
      severity: high
      threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
      impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
      solutions:
      - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
      - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
      - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
      severity: high
      impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
      solutions:
      - Mandatory fume extraction system
      - Work in well-ventilated areas
      - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
      severity: medium
      impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
      solutions:
      - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
      - Test on sample pieces first
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Coating and label removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
      solutions:
      - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
      - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
