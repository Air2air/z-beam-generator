  title: Pyrex Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning Pyrex, we've found that starting with lower power settings works best to gently remove contaminants without risking cracks. This glass stands out for its excellent thermal shock resistance, which lets you handle quick heat cycles that might shatter ordinary soda-lime types, so we often use pulsed lasers to control the energy input precisely. But watch out midway through—its low thermal conductivity can trap heat in spots, leading to uneven cleaning if you push the scan speed too high; dial it back and add passes instead. In our experience, this brings back the surface clarity on lab equipment reliably while preserving its integrity for reuse.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Thermal shock and catastrophic failure
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: ΔT > 40-100°C rapid cooling (glass-dependent)
      impact: Glass shatters from thermal gradients due to low thermal expansion and brittleness
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 5-8 second cooling between passes
      - Preheat substrate to room temperature before cleaning
      - Avoid cold spots (air vents, cold backing) during processing
      - Tempered glass more resistant but still susceptible to thermal shock
      - Monitor for stress fractures; stop immediately if cracks appear
    - challenge: Low thermal diffusivity
      severity: high
      property_value: 0.01-15 mm²/s (most glasses 0.5-1.0 mm²/s)
      impact: Heat accumulates in localized zones creating thermal gradients
      solutions:
      - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
      - Increase scan speed to distribute heat (1000-2000 mm/s)
      - Use defocused beam to spread energy over larger area
      - Optical-grade glass (fused silica) tolerates higher power
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Surface defects and stress concentrators
      severity: high
      impact: Scratches, chips, and inclusions dramatically lower damage threshold
      solutions:
      - Inspect surface with magnification before cleaning
      - Reduce power 40-50% for scratched or damaged glass
      - Clean around defects with extreme caution
      - Polished optical glass requires different parameters than rough architectural glass
    - challenge: Coating and film removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Thin films, anti-reflective coatings, and tints have different damage thresholds than substrate
      solutions:
      - Test on edge first to determine coating removal threshold
      - Coated glass may require 40-60W initial pass
      - Bare glass requires 20-30% lower power after coating removal
      - AR coatings very sensitive - use 30-40W maximum
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Adhesive and paint removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Thick coatings require multiple passes and generate debris that can scratch glass
      solutions:
      - First pass 60W fast (1800 mm/s) for bulk removal
      - Second pass 40W slow (1000 mm/s) for residue
      - Use air assist to blow debris away from surface
      - Chemical pre-treatment reduces laser exposure time
      - Avoid dragging ablated material across clean areas
