title: Cedar Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning cedar, we typically begin by selecting a low-power setting to match its soft, porous structure. This wood absorbs laser energy readily because of its low reflectivity, which allows contaminants to vaporize without much resistance. We've found that starting with a focused spot size helps expose surface layers evenly, reducing the risk of uneven cleaning on its lightweight frame. As you proceed, maintain a moderate scan speed to account for cedar's poor heat conduction—heat tends to localize and can char the material if you push too fast. In our experience, this calls for two passes with significant overlap to restore the wood's natural grain without embedding residues in its open pores. Watch out for overexposure in the middle of thicker sections, where porosity traps moisture and amplifies thermal buildup; dial back the energy density there to avoid splintering. Overall, these adjustments preserve cedar's flexibility for applications like furniture
  restoration or heritage work.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Charring and carbonization
    severity: high
    threshold_temperature: 250-300°C
    impact: Wood chars at low temperatures leaving black marks and structural damage
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 2-5 second cooling between passes
    - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
    - Increase scan speed to reduce dwell time
    - Monitor surface for discoloration; stop if browning occurs
  - challenge: Slow thermal diffusivity
    severity: medium
    property_value: 0.10-0.15 mm²/s (100x slower than aluminum)
    impact: Heat accumulates rapidly causing thermal damage zones
    solutions:
    - Increase cooling time between passes
    - Use lower repetition rates (<20 kHz)
    - Apply crosshatch patterns to distribute heat
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Grain direction sensitivity
    severity: medium
    variation: 20-40% absorption variation by grain orientation
    impact: Laser absorption varies significantly with grain direction
    solutions:
    - Scan parallel to grain for consistent results
    - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) for uniform cleaning
    - Test on scrap to determine optimal scan direction
  - challenge: Porous structure with deep contamination
    severity: medium
    porosity_range: 12-65% (softwoods highest)
    impact: Contaminants penetrate deep into wood structure
    solutions:
    - Multiple passes with progressive power increase
    - Reduce scan speed for deeper penetration (600 mm/s)
    - Chemical pre-treatment for deep-seated contamination
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Varnish and coating removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Thick coatings require multiple passes and generate smoke/fumes
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 60W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Limit to 2-3 passes maximum to avoid substrate damage
