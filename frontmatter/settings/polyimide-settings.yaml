title: polyimide-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning Polyimide, you'll want to begin with a low pulse energy to gently remove contaminants without risking thermal damage. This material's high heat resistance works in your favor, allowing steady progress on stubborn residues like oils or particles, but you must monitor the surface closely since it absorbs laser energy moderately well and can char if you push too hard. Make sure you use short pulses and keep the beam moving to avoid localized heating that builds up quickly on its non-porous, tough surface. In my setups, this approach restores the smooth finish effectively, preserving the polymer's flexibility and strength for electronics or aerospace parts. Watch out midway through for any discoloration—dial back the power immediately if it appears, as overheating leads to cracking or brittleness that ruins the material's durability. Adjust your scanning speed upward as you go to maintain even coverage.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    challenge_id: low_melting_degradation_temperatures
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    challenge_id: outgassing_and_fume_generation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
    challenge_id: variable_absorption_by_color_and_additives
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
