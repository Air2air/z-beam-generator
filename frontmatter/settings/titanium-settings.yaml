title: titanium-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning titanium, I've seen it stand out from denser metals like steel because of its lighter weight and strong natural oxide layer that fights corrosion so well. This makes it great for aerospace parts, where you can remove tough contaminants without deep damage, but the layer also means the laser tends to skim the surface gently—start with milder power and slower passes to let heat dissipate evenly and avoid uneven heating. Unlike aluminum, which scatters heat quickly, titanium holds it locally, so building up multiple light passes clears buildup effectively while preserving its durability. Just watch out at the end for any signs of discoloration, and dial back if needed to keep that protective shine intact.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
    severity: medium
    property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
    impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
    solutions:
    - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
    - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
    - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
    challenge_id: high_thermal_conductivity_and_heat_spread
  - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
    impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
    solutions:
    - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
    - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
    - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
    challenge_id: melting_and_heat_affected_zone_formation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: High reflectivity
    severity: high
    reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
    impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
    solutions:
    - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
    - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
    - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
    - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
    challenge_id: high_reflectivity
  - challenge: Surface finish variations
    severity: medium
    impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on surface condition
    - Test parameters on similar finish samples
    - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
    challenge_id: surface_finish_variations
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base metal
    solutions:
    - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
    - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
    - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
    challenge_id: rust_and_oxide_layer_removal
  - challenge: Oil and grease removal
    severity: low
    impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
    solutions:
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
    - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
