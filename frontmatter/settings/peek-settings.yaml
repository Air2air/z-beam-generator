title: peek-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning PEEK, you'll want to tackle its low absorption of laser energy first. This thermoplastic stays mostly transparent to the beam, so heat builds up slowly but can suddenly degrade the surface if you're not careful. Start with lower power settings to gently remove contaminants without melting the material. Make sure you use short pulses—they help control the heat and prevent cracking on this strong, non-porous plastic. Watch out mid-process for any discoloration; dial back the speed right away to avoid weakening its heat resistance. Adjust scans to overlap minimally, bringing back a clean finish while keeping PEEK's durability intact.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    challenge_id: low_melting_degradation_temperatures
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    challenge_id: outgassing_and_fume_generation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
    challenge_id: variable_absorption_by_color_and_additives
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
    challenge_id: coating_and_label_removal
