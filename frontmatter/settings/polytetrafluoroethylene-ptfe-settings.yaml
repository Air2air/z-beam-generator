title: polytetrafluoroethylene-ptfe-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning Polytetrafluoroethylene, watch its high reflectivity right away. It reflects light much more than typical plastics, slowing the process down. Start low on power to build absorption gradually. I've seen multiple passes work best here. Unlike conductive metals, its poor heat spread risks local burns, so keep scans quick. This restores surfaces cleanly without warping.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Low melting/degradation temperatures
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 80-300°C depending on polymer type
    impact: Melting, warping, or chemical degradation at low temperatures
    solutions:
    - Use lowest power settings (20-40W)
    - Fast scan speeds (2000-4000 mm/s)
    - Pulse mode with extended cooling (5-10 seconds between passes)
    challenge_id: low_melting_degradation_temperatures
  - challenge: Outgassing and fume generation
    severity: high
    impact: Toxic fumes, smoke, and potential fire hazard
    solutions:
    - Mandatory fume extraction system
    - Work in well-ventilated areas
    - Monitor for smoke/discoloration
    challenge_id: outgassing_and_fume_generation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Variable absorption by color and additives
    severity: medium
    impact: Black plastics absorb 80-90%, white plastics absorb 10-30%
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on plastic color (dark = lower, light = higher)
    - Test on sample pieces first
    challenge_id: variable_absorption_by_color_and_additives
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and label removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives melt and smear rather than ablate cleanly
    solutions:
    - Use UV wavelength (355nm) for better photochemical ablation
    - Multiple gentle passes instead of single high-power pass
    challenge_id: coating_and_label_removal
