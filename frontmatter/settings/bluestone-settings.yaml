title: Bluestone Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning Bluestone, make sure you dial back power compared to tougher igneous rocks, since its softer sedimentary structure heats unevenly and risks cracking under steady beams. Focus first on its sluggish heat spread—this keeps energy focused but demands slower passes to prevent surface damage. Boost overlap for thorough coverage on the somewhat porous texture, ensuring clean results without etching.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Thermal shock and microcracking
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
    impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal stress
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
    - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
    - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
    - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
    - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
  - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
    severity: high
    threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
    impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
    solutions:
    - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
    - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
    - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
    - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
    - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Weathering and surface degradation
    severity: high
    impact: Aged stone has weaker surface layer more susceptible to damage
    solutions:
    - Reduce power 40-60% for weathered stone vs fresh stone
    - Test on inconspicuous area first
    - Multiple gentle passes (4-6 at 40-60W) preferred
    - Monitor for powdering or flaking; adjust power immediately
    - Heritage conservation requires documentation and testing
  - challenge: Mineral composition heterogeneity
    severity: medium
    impact: Mixed minerals have different absorption and damage thresholds
    solutions:
    - Use moderate power (60-80W) suitable for both light and dark minerals
    - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
    - Avoid dwelling on dark minerals (feldspar, mica) which absorb more energy
    - Quartzite and marble more homogeneous than granite
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Biological growth and deep staining
    severity: medium
    porosity_range: 0.5-25% (sandstone highly porous)
    impact: Algae, lichen, and pollution penetrate deep into porous structure
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1200 mm/s) for surface growth
    - Second pass 60W slow (700 mm/s) for roots and stains
    - Third pass 40W very slow (400 mm/s) for deep staining
    - Chemical biocide pre-treatment kills roots and reduces laser exposure
    - Dense stones (granite, marble) clean in 1-2 passes vs 3-4 for porous stones
