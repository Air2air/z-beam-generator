  title: Oak Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: We've found Oak's open porosity sets it apart from denser hardwoods like maple. This lets contaminants seep deep into the grain, so we typically start with low-power passes to gently draw them out without charring. Watch for uneven heat buildup in those pores—bump up overlap midway to even things out and preserve the wood's natural strength.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Charring and carbonization
      severity: high
      threshold_temperature: 250-300°C
      impact: Wood chars at low temperatures leaving black marks and structural damage
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 2-5 second cooling between passes
      - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
      - Increase scan speed to reduce dwell time
      - Monitor surface for discoloration; stop if browning occurs
    - challenge: Slow thermal diffusivity
      severity: medium
      property_value: 0.10-0.15 mm²/s (100x slower than aluminum)
      impact: Heat accumulates rapidly causing thermal damage zones
      solutions:
      - Increase cooling time between passes
      - Use lower repetition rates (<20 kHz)
      - Apply crosshatch patterns to distribute heat
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Grain direction sensitivity
      severity: medium
      variation: 20-40% absorption variation by grain orientation
      impact: Laser absorption varies significantly with grain direction
      solutions:
      - Scan parallel to grain for consistent results
      - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) for uniform cleaning
      - Test on scrap to determine optimal scan direction
    - challenge: Porous structure with deep contamination
      severity: medium
      porosity_range: 12-65% (softwoods highest)
      impact: Contaminants penetrate deep into wood structure
      solutions:
      - Multiple passes with progressive power increase
      - Reduce scan speed for deeper penetration (600 mm/s)
      - Chemical pre-treatment for deep-seated contamination
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Varnish and coating removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Thick coatings require multiple passes and generate smoke/fumes
      solutions:
      - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
      - Second pass 60W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
      - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
      - Limit to 2-3 passes maximum to avoid substrate damage
