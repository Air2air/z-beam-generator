  title: Stucco Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: In our experience, the key with Stucco lies in its porous, cement-based structure that absorbs contaminants deeply while resisting heat buildup effectively during laser cleaning. We've found this makes it different from smoother masonry, so we typically start with controlled, low-intensity passes to gently lift surface grime without cracking the fragile matrix—watch out for overexposure here, as it can dry out and weaken the bonds mid-process. To handle this, we adjust by overlapping scans lightly and adding a damp post-treatment to restore evenness, ensuring clean results for heritage restorations.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling and explosive failure
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
      impact: Trapped moisture converts to steam causing explosive surface spalling
      solutions:
      - Test moisture content before cleaning (>5% moisture requires drying)
      - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling for wet materials
      - Reduce power by 50-60% for damp masonry
      - Allow 24-48 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
      - Monitor for popping sounds or surface lifting; stop immediately
    - challenge: Low thermal diffusivity and heat accumulation
      severity: high
      property_value: 0.1-1.0 mm²/s (3-10x slower than metals)
      impact: Heat concentrates in surface layer causing thermal stress
      solutions:
      - Increase cooling time between passes (8-12 seconds)
      - Use low repetition rates (<20 kHz)
      - Defocused beam reduces peak intensity
      - Multiple gentle passes preferred over aggressive single pass
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: High porosity and deep contamination
      severity: high
      porosity_range: 10-25% (brick and concrete highly porous)
      impact: Contaminants penetrate deep into porous structure
      solutions:
      - Multiple progressive passes with power increase (50W → 80W → 100W)
      - Reduce scan speed for deeper penetration (400-600 mm/s)
      - Chemical pre-treatment for biological growth (algae, lichen)
      - Expect 3-5 passes for complete cleaning vs 1-2 for dense materials
    - challenge: Surface heterogeneity and aggregate exposure
      severity: medium
      impact: Mixed composition (cement matrix, aggregates, voids) causes variable absorption
      solutions:
      - Use moderate power (70-90W) suitable for both matrix and aggregates
      - Crosshatch scan pattern for uniform coverage
      - Monitor for differential ablation; adjust power if aggregates become prominent
      - Aged masonry more challenging than new construction
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Paint and coating removal from porous substrate
      severity: medium
      impact: Paint penetrates into pores requiring deep cleaning without substrate damage
      solutions:
      - First pass 100W fast (1500 mm/s) for surface paint layer
      - Second pass 70W slow (800 mm/s) for paint in pores
      - Third pass 50W very slow (500 mm/s) for residual staining
      - Chemical stripping pre-treatment reduces laser exposure
      - Heritage masonry requires gentler approach (max 60W)
