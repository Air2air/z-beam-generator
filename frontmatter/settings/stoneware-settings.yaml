  title: Stoneware Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning stoneware, you'll want to start with its dense, low-porosity nature. This makes it highly resistant to deep penetration by contaminants, so the laser clears surface grime efficiently without soaking into the material. Make sure you keep the power low at first to handle its poor heat spreading—heat builds up quickly, which can lead to cracks if you're not careful. Adjust by using short pulses and multiple light passes, overlapping them to restore the finish evenly. Watch out for overdoing it mid-process; that dense hardness means it holds up well to abrasion but risks micro-fractures from sudden heat spikes. This approach keeps your stoneware intact for heritage or industrial reuse.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Thermal shock and cracking
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: ΔT > 200-300°C rapid cooling
      impact: Ceramics crack catastrophically from rapid temperature changes due to low thermal expansion
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 3-5 second cooling between passes
      - Gradual power ramping (start 50W, increase 10W per pass)
      - Preheat substrate to reduce thermal gradients
      - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
    - challenge: Variable thermal conductivity
      severity: medium
      property_value: 0.8-120 W/m·K (150x variation between materials)
      impact: SiC/WC conduct heat well, but alumina/zirconia accumulate heat rapidly
      solutions:
      - Low conductivity ceramics (alumina, zirconia) require 50% longer cooling
      - High conductivity ceramics (SiC, WC) tolerate higher power
      - Test on scrap to determine cooling requirements
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Surface defects and damage threshold
      severity: high
      impact: Micro-cracks, pores, and surface defects dramatically lower damage threshold
      solutions:
      - Inspect surface with magnification before cleaning
      - Reduce power 30-40% for porous or aged ceramics
      - Use multiple low-energy passes rather than single high-energy pass
      - Polished ceramics tolerate 2-3x higher fluence than rough surfaces
    - challenge: Porosity variation
      severity: medium
      porosity_range: 0-30% (dense vs porous ceramics)
      impact: Porous ceramics trap contaminants deep in structure and scatter laser energy
      solutions:
      - Dense ceramics (0-5% porosity) clean easily at 100-150W
      - Porous ceramics require multiple progressive passes
      - Use crosshatch scan pattern for uniform penetration
      - Chemical pre-treatment for deep contamination in porous ceramics
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Coating and residue removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Hard coatings (PVD, thermal barrier) require high energy but risk substrate damage
      solutions:
      - First pass 120W fast (2000 mm/s) for bulk coating removal
      - Second pass 80W slow (1000 mm/s) for residue
      - Monitor for substrate exposure; adjust power accordingly
      - PVD coatings may require chemical assist for complete removal
