material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Thermal shock and cracking
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: ΔT > 200-300°C rapid cooling
    impact: Ceramics crack catastrophically from rapid temperature changes due to
      low thermal expansion
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 3-5 second cooling between passes
    - Gradual power ramping (start 50W, increase 10W per pass)
    - Preheat substrate to reduce thermal gradients
    - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
  - challenge: Variable thermal conductivity
    severity: medium
    property_value: 0.8-120 W/m·K (150x variation between materials)
    impact: SiC/WC conduct heat well, but alumina/zirconia accumulate heat rapidly
    solutions:
    - Low conductivity ceramics (alumina, zirconia) require 50% longer cooling
    - High conductivity ceramics (SiC, WC) tolerate higher power
    - Test on scrap to determine cooling requirements
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Surface defects and damage threshold
    severity: high
    impact: Micro-cracks, pores, and surface defects dramatically lower damage threshold
    solutions:
    - Inspect surface with magnification before cleaning
    - Reduce power 30-40% for porous or aged ceramics
    - Use multiple low-energy passes rather than single high-energy pass
    - Polished ceramics tolerate 2-3x higher fluence than rough surfaces
  - challenge: Porosity variation
    severity: medium
    porosity_range: 0-30% (dense vs porous ceramics)
    impact: Porous ceramics trap contaminants deep in structure and scatter laser
      energy
    solutions:
    - Dense ceramics (0-5% porosity) clean easily at 100-150W
    - Porous ceramics require multiple progressive passes
    - Use crosshatch scan pattern for uniform penetration
    - Chemical pre-treatment for deep contamination in porous ceramics
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Coating and residue removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Hard coatings (PVD, thermal barrier) require high energy but risk substrate
      damage
    solutions:
    - First pass 120W fast (2000 mm/s) for bulk coating removal
    - Second pass 80W slow (1000 mm/s) for residue
    - Monitor for substrate exposure; adjust power accordingly
    - PVD coatings may require chemical assist for complete removal
settings_description: When laser cleaning stoneware, you'll want to start with its
  dense, low-porosity nature. This makes it highly resistant to deep penetration by
  contaminants, so the laser clears surface grime efficiently without soaking into
  the material. Make sure you keep the power low at first to handle its poor heat
  spreading—heat builds up quickly, which can lead to cracks if you're not careful.
  Adjust by using short pulses and multiple light passes, overlapping them to restore
  the finish evenly. Watch out for overdoing it mid-process; that dense hardness means
  it holds up well to abrasion but risks micro-fractures from sudden heat spikes.
  This approach keeps your stoneware intact for heritage or industrial reuse.
