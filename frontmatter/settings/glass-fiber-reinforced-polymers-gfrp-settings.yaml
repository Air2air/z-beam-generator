material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Matrix degradation and delamination
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Polymer matrix 150-350°C, ceramic matrix >1000°C
    impact: Heat causes matrix decomposition, fiber-matrix debonding, and layer separation
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 5-10 second cooling for polymer-matrix composites
    - Reduce power by 40-50% compared to monolithic materials
    - Monitor for discoloration, bubbling, or layer lifting
    - Ceramic and metal-matrix composites tolerate higher power
  - challenge: Anisotropic thermal properties
    severity: high
    property_value: 10-100x variation parallel vs perpendicular to fibers
    impact: Heat conducts rapidly along fibers but poorly across layers
    solutions:
    - Scan parallel to fiber direction for best heat dissipation
    - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) to identify fiber orientation
    - Increase cooling time 2-3x when scanning perpendicular to fibers
    - Carbon fiber composites require special attention due to electrical conductivity
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Fiber exposure and damage
    severity: high
    impact: Aggressive cleaning exposes or damages reinforcing fibers
    solutions:
    - Use low energy density (0.5-2 J/cm²) to protect matrix
    - Multiple gentle passes preferred over single aggressive pass
    - Stop immediately if fibers become visible
    - Fiber-rich surfaces (woven cloth) more sensitive than particle-filled
  - challenge: Surface finish variability
    severity: medium
    impact: Gel coat, paint, or protective layers alter absorption and damage threshold
    solutions:
    - Test on edge or hidden area first
    - Coated surfaces may require 50-100W initial pass for coating removal
    - Bare composite requires 30-50% lower power
    - Adjust parameters when transitioning between coated and uncoated areas
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Resin-based contaminant removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives, sealants, and coatings chemically bond to matrix
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 50W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - Chemical pre-treatment improves results for stubborn adhesives
    - Monitor for matrix damage; stop if surface texture changes
