title: Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: We've found that GFRP's embedded glass fibers in a polymer matrix demand careful laser setup right from the start to avoid delamination. Start with lower power levels and slower scan speeds, since the fibers can channel heat unevenly. This composite nature sets it apart from uniform metals—heat builds up in the resin quickly, risking cracks. We typically use multiple light passes with good overlap to gently remove contaminants without stressing the fibers. Watch for surface blistering; it signals overexposure, so dial back energy if you see any bubbling. In our experience, this approach restores the surface cleanly for aerospace parts while preserving strength.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Matrix degradation and delamination
    severity: critical
    threshold_temperature: Polymer matrix 150-350°C, ceramic matrix >1000°C
    impact: Heat causes matrix decomposition, fiber-matrix debonding, and layer separation
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 5-10 second cooling for polymer-matrix composites
    - Reduce power by 40-50% compared to monolithic materials
    - Monitor for discoloration, bubbling, or layer lifting
    - Ceramic and metal-matrix composites tolerate higher power
  - challenge: Anisotropic thermal properties
    severity: high
    property_value: 10-100x variation parallel vs perpendicular to fibers
    impact: Heat conducts rapidly along fibers but poorly across layers
    solutions:
    - Scan parallel to fiber direction for best heat dissipation
    - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) to identify fiber orientation
    - Increase cooling time 2-3x when scanning perpendicular to fibers
    - Carbon fiber composites require special attention due to electrical conductivity
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Fiber exposure and damage
    severity: high
    impact: Aggressive cleaning exposes or damages reinforcing fibers
    solutions:
    - Use low energy density (0.5-2 J/cm²) to protect matrix
    - Multiple gentle passes preferred over single aggressive pass
    - Stop immediately if fibers become visible
    - Fiber-rich surfaces (woven cloth) more sensitive than particle-filled
  - challenge: Surface finish variability
    severity: medium
    impact: Gel coat, paint, or protective layers alter absorption and damage threshold
    solutions:
    - Test on edge or hidden area first
    - Coated surfaces may require 50-100W initial pass for coating removal
    - Bare composite requires 30-50% lower power
    - Adjust parameters when transitioning between coated and uncoated areas
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Resin-based contaminant removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Adhesives, sealants, and coatings chemically bond to matrix
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 50W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - Chemical pre-treatment improves results for stubborn adhesives
    - Monitor for matrix damage; stop if surface texture changes
