material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
    severity: medium
    property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
    impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
    solutions:
    - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
    - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
    - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
  - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
    severity: high
    threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
    impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
    solutions:
    - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
    - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
    - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: High reflectivity
    severity: high
    reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
    impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
    solutions:
    - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
    - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
    - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
    - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
  - challenge: Surface finish variations
    severity: medium
    impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
    solutions:
    - Adjust power based on surface condition
    - Test parameters on similar finish samples
    - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base
      metal
    solutions:
    - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
    - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
    - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
  - challenge: Oil and grease removal
    severity: low
    impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
    solutions:
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
    - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
settings_description: When laser cleaning nickel, we often run into its strong reflectivity
  first. This bounces back a good portion of the beam. So, the energy doesn't sink
  in as deeply as we'd like. We've found that starting with focused pulses helps overcome
  this. Nickel conducts heat quickly too. That spreads warmth evenly and avoids hot
  spots. But it also means you need steady control to prevent warping. Its tough surface
  resists corrosion well. So, cleaning uncovers a durable base without extra damage
  risks. We typically use multiple light passes for even removal. Watch out at the
  end—overdo the power, and you risk surface cracks from thermal stress.
