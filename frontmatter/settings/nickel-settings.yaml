  title: Nickel Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning nickel, we often run into its strong reflectivity first. This bounces back a good portion of the beam. So, the energy doesn't sink in as deeply as we'd like. We've found that starting with focused pulses helps overcome this. Nickel conducts heat quickly too. That spreads warmth evenly and avoids hot spots. But it also means you need steady control to prevent warping. Its tough surface resists corrosion well. So, cleaning uncovers a durable base without extra damage risks. We typically use multiple light passes for even removal. Watch out at the end—overdo the power, and you risk surface cracks from thermal stress.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: High thermal conductivity and heat spread
      severity: medium
      property_value: 4-400 W/(m·K) depending on metal
      impact: Heat spreads rapidly causing large heat-affected zones
      solutions:
      - Use shorter pulse durations (picosecond/femtosecond) for localized heating
      - Increase scan speed to minimize dwell time
      - Apply cooling between passes for thick sections
    - challenge: Melting and heat-affected zone formation
      severity: high
      threshold_range: 660°C (Al) to 3422°C (W)
      impact: Substrate melting or microstructural changes in heat-affected zone
      solutions:
      - Stay below 70% of melting temperature
      - Use pulse mode with adequate cooling time
      - Monitor for surface discoloration indicating oxidation
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: High reflectivity
      severity: high
      reflectivity_range: 60-95% at 1064nm for polished metals
      impact: Most laser energy reflected, requiring higher power; safety hazard
      solutions:
      - Use shorter wavelengths (355nm UV) for better absorption
      - Increase power density but monitor for thermal damage
      - Ensure proper beam containment and safety measures
      - Surface oxidation/roughness improves absorption
    - challenge: Surface finish variations
      severity: medium
      impact: Polished surfaces reflect more, rough surfaces absorb better
      solutions:
      - Adjust power based on surface condition
      - Test parameters on similar finish samples
      - Polished surfaces need 20-40% more power
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Rust and oxide layer removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Requires multiple passes; rust/oxide has different absorption than base metal
      solutions:
      - First pass at higher power (100-120W) to remove bulk oxide
      - Second pass at lower power (60-80W) for final cleaning
      - Monitor for base metal exposure to avoid over-processing
    - challenge: Oil and grease removal
      severity: low
      impact: Organic contaminants vaporize easily but can redeposit
      solutions:
      - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
      - Higher scan speeds (3000-5000 mm/s) for thin films
      - Chemical pre-cleaning for heavy contamination
