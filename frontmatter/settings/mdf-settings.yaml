title: mdf-laser-cleaning Laser Cleaning Settings
settings_description: When laser cleaning MDF, the biggest hurdle is its porous structure. It soaks up heat unevenly. This leads to quick charring if you're not careful. I've seen surfaces bubble and delaminate from that buildup. Start low on power to let the laser gently lift dirt without penetrating deep. Its fibrous makeup differs from solid woods—more uniform but fragile under stress. That means you adjust scans slower for even coverage. Tends to absorb contaminants well, restoring finishes nicely in furniture or panels. But watch the edges; they fray easily. Keep passes light and overlapped just enough. In my experience, this brings back that smooth look without warping. Finally, avoid high energy bursts—they scorch the core and ruin the board.

material_challenges:
  thermal_management:
  - challenge: Charring and carbonization
    severity: high
    threshold_temperature: 250-300°C
    impact: Wood chars at low temperatures leaving black marks and structural damage
    solutions:
    - Use pulse mode with 2-5 second cooling between passes
    - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
    - Increase scan speed to reduce dwell time
    - Monitor surface for discoloration; stop if browning occurs
    challenge_id: charring_and_carbonization
  - challenge: Slow thermal diffusivity
    severity: medium
    property_value: 0.10-0.15 mm²/s (100x slower than aluminum)
    impact: Heat accumulates rapidly causing thermal damage zones
    solutions:
    - Increase cooling time between passes
    - Use lower repetition rates (<20 kHz)
    - Apply crosshatch patterns to distribute heat
    challenge_id: slow_thermal_diffusivity
  surface_characteristics:
  - challenge: Grain direction sensitivity
    severity: medium
    variation: 20-40% absorption variation by grain orientation
    impact: Laser absorption varies significantly with grain direction
    solutions:
    - Scan parallel to grain for consistent results
    - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) for uniform cleaning
    - Test on scrap to determine optimal scan direction
    challenge_id: grain_direction_sensitivity
  - challenge: Porous structure with deep contamination
    severity: medium
    porosity_range: 12-65% (softwoods highest)
    impact: Contaminants penetrate deep into wood structure
    solutions:
    - Multiple passes with progressive power increase
    - Reduce scan speed for deeper penetration (600 mm/s)
    - Chemical pre-treatment for deep-seated contamination
    challenge_id: porous_structure_with_deep_contamination
  contamination_challenges:
  - challenge: Varnish and coating removal
    severity: medium
    impact: Thick coatings require multiple passes and generate smoke/fumes
    solutions:
    - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
    - Second pass 60W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
    - Use fume extraction to prevent redeposition
    - Limit to 2-3 passes maximum to avoid substrate damage
