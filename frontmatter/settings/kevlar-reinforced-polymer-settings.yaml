  title: Kevlar-Reinforced Polymer Laser Cleaning Settings
  settings_description: When laser cleaning Kevlar-reinforced polymer, watch its low heat conduction first—it traps warmth unevenly and risks fiber damage if you push too hard. I've found starting with gentle pulses works best, spreading energy slowly to avoid delamination. This tough composite shines in aerospace parts, where its strength holds up without warping. Just keep scans steady; overtreatment weakens the reinforcement bonds.

  material_challenges:
    thermal_management:
    - challenge: Matrix degradation and delamination
      severity: critical
      threshold_temperature: Polymer matrix 150-350°C, ceramic matrix >1000°C
      impact: Heat causes matrix decomposition, fiber-matrix debonding, and layer separation
      solutions:
      - Use pulse mode with 5-10 second cooling for polymer-matrix composites
      - Reduce power by 40-50% compared to monolithic materials
      - Monitor for discoloration, bubbling, or layer lifting
      - Ceramic and metal-matrix composites tolerate higher power
    - challenge: Anisotropic thermal properties
      severity: high
      property_value: 10-100x variation parallel vs perpendicular to fibers
      impact: Heat conducts rapidly along fibers but poorly across layers
      solutions:
      - Scan parallel to fiber direction for best heat dissipation
      - Use crosshatch pattern (0° and 90°) to identify fiber orientation
      - Increase cooling time 2-3x when scanning perpendicular to fibers
      - Carbon fiber composites require special attention due to electrical conductivity
    surface_characteristics:
    - challenge: Fiber exposure and damage
      severity: high
      impact: Aggressive cleaning exposes or damages reinforcing fibers
      solutions:
      - Use low energy density (0.5-2 J/cm²) to protect matrix
      - Multiple gentle passes preferred over single aggressive pass
      - Stop immediately if fibers become visible
      - Fiber-rich surfaces (woven cloth) more sensitive than particle-filled
    - challenge: Surface finish variability
      severity: medium
      impact: Gel coat, paint, or protective layers alter absorption and damage threshold
      solutions:
      - Test on edge or hidden area first
      - Coated surfaces may require 50-100W initial pass for coating removal
      - Bare composite requires 30-50% lower power
      - Adjust parameters when transitioning between coated and uncoated areas
    contamination_challenges:
    - challenge: Resin-based contaminant removal
      severity: medium
      impact: Adhesives, sealants, and coatings chemically bond to matrix
      solutions:
      - First pass 80W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
      - Second pass 50W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
      - Chemical pre-treatment improves results for stubborn adhesives
      - Monitor for matrix damage; stop if surface texture changes
