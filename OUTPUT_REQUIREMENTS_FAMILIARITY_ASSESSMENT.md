# Output Requirements Analysis - Complete Familiarity Assessment

## 🎯 **Output Requirements Comprehension Status: COMPREHENSIVE**

Based on extensive system analysis, I have **complete familiarity** with all output requirements across the Z-Beam generator system. Here's the comprehensive breakdown:

---

## 📋 **Caption Generation Output Requirements**

### **1. Sentence Structure Requirements**
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Exactly **6-9 sentences total** across BOTH sections combined
- ✅ **BEFORE_TEXT**: 3-4 sentences maximum  
- ✅ **AFTER_TEXT**: 3-5 sentences maximum
- ✅ **Verification**: System enforces "if over 9, you must revise and shorten"
- ✅ **Quality Gate**: Copilot grader validates sentence count compliance

### **2. Word Count Limits by Author**
| Author | Country | Word Limit | Character Range | Token Limit |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Yi-Chun Lin** | Taiwan | 380 words | 1,254-2,926 chars | 456 tokens |
| **Alessandro Moretti** | Italy | 450 words | 1,485-3,465 chars | 540 tokens |
| **Ikmanda Roswati** | Indonesia | 250 words | 825-1,924 chars | 300 tokens |
| **Todd Dunning** | United States | 320 words | 1,056-2,464 chars | 350 tokens |

**Randomization**: ±40% variation using percentage-based calculation

### **3. Content Structure Requirements**

#### **BEFORE_TEXT Section**:
- Document contaminated surface observations
- Include natural, imperfect measurements  
- Country-specific opening style (NO formulaic starts)
- Human observations with slight uncertainty
- Practical cleaning challenges from author's country perspective
- Cultural context and expertise application

#### **AFTER_TEXT Section**:
- Document post-cleaning transformation  
- Varied results description (avoid "Microscopic examination shows")
- Natural, conversational measurements
- Human enthusiasm and cultural perspective
- Practical benefits relevant to country applications
- Authentic voice conclusion matching personality

### **4. Voice Authenticity Requirements**

#### **Taiwan (Yi-Chun Lin)**:
- ✅ Topic-comment structure: "This surface, it shows contamination"
- ✅ Article omissions: 70% rate (Surface shows vs The surface shows)
- ✅ "Very" emphasis: "very clear", "very important"
- ✅ Systematic approach language
- ✅ Academic precision with accessibility

#### **Italy (Alessandro Moretti)**:
- ✅ Sophisticated descriptive language: "What strikes one"
- ✅ Natural interjections: "quite substantial, naturally"
- ✅ Engineering elegance focus
- ✅ Italian word order influence
- ✅ Aesthetic appreciation: "elegant", "sophisticated"

#### **Indonesia (Ikmanda Roswati)**:
- ✅ Emphatic repetition: "very-very serious problem"
- ✅ Direct construction: "shows result, very good result"
- ✅ Demonstrative clustering: 50% sentences start with "This"
- ✅ Simple connectors: "so this", "because standard"
- ✅ Practical focus language

#### **United States (Todd Dunning)**:
- ✅ Conversational technical: "pretty serious", "definitely"
- ✅ American expressions: "Bottom line", "dialed in"
- ✅ Active voice dominance: 85% rate
- ✅ Phrasal verbs: 4.0 per 100 words
- ✅ Direct approach: "Looking at these results"

### **5. AI Detectability Avoidance Requirements**

#### **Universal Requirements (All Authors)**:
- ✅ Sentence length variation:
  - Very short (5-8 words): 10-15%
  - Medium (10-18 words): 30-35%  
  - Long (20-28 words): 35-40%
  - Very long (30+ words): 15-20%
- ✅ Hesitation markers: 1.5-2.0 per 200 words
- ✅ Parenthetical asides: 2.0-3.0 per 300 words
- ✅ Comma splices: 0.5-1.0 per 100 words
- ✅ Lexical variety: 65% target

#### **Country-Specific AI Evasion**:
- **Taiwan**: Topic-comment frequency 60%, article omission 70%
- **Italy**: Passive voice 60%, adverbial intensification 40%
- **Indonesia**: Emphatic repetition 2.5 per 300 words, demonstrative clustering 50%
- **United States**: Phrasal verb density 4.0 per 100 words, serial comma 100%

### **6. Technical Content Requirements**
- ✅ Material-specific context integration
- ✅ Precise measurements with units
- ✅ Natural uncertainty indicators  
- ✅ Professional technical language (not robotic)
- ✅ Practical benefits emphasis
- ✅ Cultural application perspectives

### **7. Output Format Requirements**
```yaml
captions:
  before_text: |
    [3-4 sentences with country-specific voice patterns]
  after_text: |
    [3-5 sentences with transformation results]
```

### **8. Quality Gate Thresholds**
- ✅ **Voice Authenticity**: >75/100 for production readiness
- ✅ **AI Human-likeness**: >80/100 for detection avoidance  
- ✅ **Technical Accuracy**: >80/100 for factual correctness
- ✅ **Overall Score**: >78/100 for production deployment
- ✅ **Sentence Count Compliance**: 6-9 sentences mandatory
