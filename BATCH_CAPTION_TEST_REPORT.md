**BEFORE:**

Dirt and grime smother bamboo's tough fibers here. At 1000 times magnification, contaminants block the natural channels that make this wood-like material so useful in furniture and renewable energy projects—nearly impossible to ignore the buildup. Tough mess.

**AFTER:**

Laser treatment clears it all away. Fibers stand out crisp now, ready for automotive interiors or sports gear without a trace of old residue. And that smoothness? Around 99 percent cleaner, perfect for precise work.

### 📝 GENERATED CAPTION

**BEFORE:**

Dirt covers this breccia stone. Layers of grime bury rough fragments in the matrix, hiding the stone's tough makeup entirely. Yet under 1000x view, black specks and yellow stains cling tight to edges, around 10 microns deep, turning heritage pieces dull before any cleaning starts.

**AFTER:**

Laser hits just right. Now fragments gleam clear. And at 1000x, the clean matrix shows sharp angular bits in gray tones, free from residue while keeping the stone's natural strength for architecture work.
