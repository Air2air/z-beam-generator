# Author-Specific Intensity Offsets
#
# These offsets are ADDED to the base config.yaml slider values to create
# distinct personalities for each author. This ensures variation between authors
# while still allowing global control via the main sliders.
#
# UPDATED FOR 1-10 SCALE (November 16, 2025):
# Offsets now use -3 to +3 to move across the 1-10 scale meaningfully
# Example: If base technical_language_intensity = 3 (from config.yaml, low on 1-10 scale), 
#          and Yi-Chun's offset = +2, then Yi-Chun generates with 
#          technical_language_intensity = 5 (moderate on 1-10 scale)
#
# Offset ranges: -3 to +3 (meaningful shifts within 1-10 scale)

# Usage Notes:
# 
# 1. Final intensity = base_value + author_offset
# 2. Clamped to [1, 10] range automatically
# 3. Author selection happens via Materials.yaml author.id field
# 4. Offsets applied dynamically during generation
#
# Example calculation (1-10 scale):
#   Base technical_language_intensity = 3 (from config.yaml, slider 3)
#   Yi-Chun offset = +2
#   Final value for Yi-Chun = 3 + 2 = 5 (Moderate on 1-10 scale)
#   Alessandro offset = 0
#   Final value for Alessandro = 3 + 0 = 3 (Low on 1-10 scale)
#
# Result: Yi-Chun allows moderate specs while Alessandro stays more minimal,
#         creating distinct writing styles while preserving the 1-10 scale.

# Validation Rules:
# - All offsets should be in range [-3, +3] for meaningful variation
# - Author IDs must match data/authors/registry.py
# - Country names must match persona files in prompts/personas/
