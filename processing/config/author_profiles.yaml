# Author-Specific Intensity Offsets
#
# These offsets are ADDED to the base config.yaml slider values to create
# distinct personalities for each author. This ensures variation between authors
# while still allowing global control via the main sliders.
#
# UPDATED FOR 1-3 SCALE (November 14, 2025):
# Offsets now use -1, 0, +1 to move between the 3 levels
# Example: If base technical_language_intensity = 1 (None), and Yi-Chun's offset = +1,
#          then Yi-Chun generates with technical_language_intensity = 2 (Minimal)
#
# Offset ranges: -1 to +1 (moves one level up or down within 1-3 scale)

# Usage Notes:
# 
# 1. Final intensity = base_value + author_offset
# 2. Clamped to [1, 3] range automatically
# 3. Author selection happens via Materials.yaml author.id field
# 4. Offsets applied dynamically during generation
#
# Example calculation (1-3 scale):
#   Base technical_language_intensity = 1 (from config.yaml)
#   Yi-Chun offset = +1
#   Final value for Yi-Chun = 1 + 1 = 2 (Minimal)
#   Alessandro offset = 0
#   Final value for Alessandro = 1 + 0 = 1 (None)
#
# Result: Yi-Chun allows minimal specs (1-2 properties) while Alessandro
#         stays purely qualitative (0 specs), creating distinct writing styles.

# Validation Rules:
# - All offsets must be in range [-30, +30]
# - Author IDs must match data/authors/registry.py
# - Country names must match persona files in prompts/personas/
