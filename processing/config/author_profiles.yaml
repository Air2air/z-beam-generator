# Author-Specific Intensity Offsets
#
# These offsets are ADDED to the base config.yaml slider values to create
# distinct personalities for each author. This ensures variation between authors
# while still allowing global control via the main sliders.
#
# Example: If base imperfection_tolerance = 50, and Yi-Chun's offset = -15,
#          then Yi-Chun generates with imperfection_tolerance = 35 (more precise)
#
# Offset ranges: -30 to +30 (keeps final values within 0-100 when base is reasonable)

# Usage Notes:
# 
# 1. Final intensity = base_value + author_offset
# 2. Clamped to [0, 100] range automatically
# 3. Author selection happens via Materials.yaml author.id field
# 4. Offsets applied dynamically during generation
#
# Example calculation:
#   Base imperfection_tolerance = 50 (from config.yaml)
#   Yi-Chun offset = -15
#   Final value for Yi-Chun = 50 + (-15) = 35
#   Alessandro offset = +5
#   Final value for Alessandro = 50 + 5 = 55
#
# Result: Alessandro allows more imperfections (55) than Yi-Chun (35),
#         creating noticeably different writing styles while both are
#         controlled by the same base slider.

# Validation Rules:
# - All offsets must be in range [-30, +30]
# - Author IDs must match data/authors/registry.py
# - Country names must match persona files in prompts/personas/
