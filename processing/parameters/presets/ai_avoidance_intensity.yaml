description: Controls aggressiveness of AI detection evasion techniques
maps_to: enrichment_params

# Preset prompts for each tier
prompts:
  low:
    # LOW (1-3): Minimal evasion (faster, less human-like)
    default: |-
      - AI evasion: Minimal detection avoidance; prioritize speed and clarity over perfect human simulation
  
  moderate:
    # MODERATE (4-7): Balanced approach
    default: |-
      - AI evasion: Balance detection avoidance with natural flow; use moderate human-like variations
  
  high:
    # HIGH (8-10): Aggressive evasion (slower, more human-like)
    default: |-
      - AI evasion: Aggressive detection avoidance; maximize human-like characteristics even at cost of speed

# Examples of expected output at each tier
examples:
  low: "The laser cleaning system removes contaminants efficiently and cost-effectively."
  moderate: "Laser cleaning systems handle contaminant removal pretty efficiently while keeping costs reasonable."
  high: "You know, these laser cleaning setups - they're surprisingly efficient at getting rid of contaminants, and the cost side of things? Actually quite reasonable."
