# Preset prompts for each tier and content length
prompts:
  low:
    # LOW (1-3): Uniform, consistent sentence lengths
    short: "- Sentence structure: Keep sentences consistent (8-12 words); maintain uniform rhythm"
    medium: "- Sentence structure: Use consistent sentence lengths (12-16 words); avoid dramatic variation"
    long: "- Sentence structure: Maintain steady rhythm (14-18 words per sentence); consistent flow"
  
  moderate:
    # MODERATE (4-7): Mix short and medium sentences
    short: "- Sentence structure: Mix short (5-8 words) and medium (10-14 words) sentences naturally"
    medium: "- Sentence structure: Balance short and medium sentences; vary rhythm naturally"
    long: "- Sentence structure: Mix short, medium, and longer sentences for natural flow"
  
  high:
    # HIGH (8-10): Dramatic variation in sentence lengths
    short: "- Sentence structure: WILD variation - mix very short (3-5 words) with much longer (15-20 words); unpredictable rhythm"
    medium: "- Sentence structure: DRAMATIC variation - alternate between very short (3-6 words) and long (18-25 words); avoid patterns"
    long: "- Sentence structure: EXTREME variation - range from tiny (2-4 words) to extended (25+ words); chaotic, unpredictable rhythm"

# Examples of expected output at each tier
examples:
  low: "Uniform, consistent sentence lengths create predictable rhythm"
  moderate: "Mix short and medium sentences for natural variation"
  high: "Dramatic differences in length. Some very short. Others much longer and more complex."
