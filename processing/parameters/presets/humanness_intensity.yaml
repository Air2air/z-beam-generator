description: Master control for overall human-likeness (affects temperature, penalties, thresholds)
maps_to: enrichment_params

# Preset prompts for each tier
prompts:
  low:
    # LOW (1-3): Minimal humanness (fast, 85% threshold)
    default: |-
      - Human-likeness: Minimal simulation; accept 85% human score threshold for faster generation
  
  moderate:
    # MODERATE (4-7): Balanced humanness (moderate speed, 60% threshold)
    default: |-
      - Human-likeness: Balanced approach; target 60% human score with moderate generation time
  
  high:
    # HIGH (8-10): Maximum humanness (slow, 20% threshold)
    default: |-
      - Human-likeness: Maximum simulation; pursue 20% AI detection score even if generation takes longer

# Examples of expected output at each tier
examples:
  low: "Fast generation with basic human characteristics"
  moderate: "Balanced generation with good human characteristics"
  high: "Careful generation with maximum human believability"
