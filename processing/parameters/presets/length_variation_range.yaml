# Length Variation Range Parameter
# Controls word count flexibility and tolerance

name: length_variation_range
category: variation
scale: 1-10
description: Controls how much word count can vary from target length
maps_to: enrichment_params

# Preset prompts for each tier
prompts:
  low:
    # LOW (1-3): Tight ±10% tolerance
    default: |-
      - Length tolerance: Stay very close to target word count (±10% maximum)
  
  moderate:
    # MODERATE (4-7): Moderate ±30% tolerance
    default: |-
      - Length tolerance: Allow moderate word count variation (±30% is acceptable)
  
  high:
    # HIGH (8-10): Loose ±60% tolerance
    default: |-
      - Length tolerance: Don't worry about exact word count; natural length takes priority (±60% is fine)

# Examples of expected output at each tier
examples:
  low: "Target 100 words → Deliver 90-110 words"
  moderate: "Target 100 words → Deliver 70-130 words"
  high: "Target 100 words → Deliver 40-160 words (prioritize natural flow)"
