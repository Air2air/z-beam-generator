# Preset prompts for each tier
prompts:
  low:
    # LOW (1-3): Strict patterns, highly consistent
    default: |-
      - Structure: Maintain strict structural patterns; use consistent organization throughout
      - Opening Variation: CRITICAL - Start each piece differently. BANNED OPENINGS: "Under the microscope", "At 1000x magnification". Use varied approaches: direct observations, property mentions, application contexts, condition descriptions.
  
  moderate:
    # MODERATE (4-7): Some variation, flexible patterns
    default: |-
      - Structure: Allow natural structural variation; mix predictable and unexpected patterns
      - Opening Variation: REQUIRED - Never repeat opening phrases. Alternate between: microscope observations (sparingly), material properties, visual descriptions, contamination focus, comparison contexts. First 8 words must be unique across all content.
  
  high:
    # HIGH (8-10): Unpredictable, highly varied
    default: |-
      - Structure: Embrace unpredictable structure; vary organization freely for natural human feel
      - Opening Variation: MANDATORY - Maximum diversity required. Each opening must be completely distinct. Rotate through: direct observations, rhetorical elements, property statements, condition assessments, contextual references. Zero repeated opening patterns allowed.

# Examples of expected output at each tier
examples:
  low: "First, prepare the surface. Second, configure the laser. Third, begin cleaning."
  moderate: "Start by preparing the surface. You'll want to configure the laser settings next - power, frequency, that sort of thing. Then you can begin the actual cleaning process."
  high: "Surface prep comes first, obviously. Oh, and don't forget laser configuration (power settings are critical here). Once that's sorted, cleaning itself is straightforward."
