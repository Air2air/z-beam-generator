# Processing Pipeline Configuration
# Simple 11-control system with 1-3 scale for content generation
#
# 🎯 SIMPLE 1-3 SCALE: 1 = Low/Minimal, 2 = Moderate/Balanced, 3 = High/Maximum
#
# ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (1-3 Scale):
#   Content too robotic?      → Set: rhythm=3, imperfection=3, structural=3
#   Output too informal?      → Set: personality=1, engagement=1, imperfection=1
#   Not technical enough?     → Set: technical=3, context=3
#   Too inconsistent?         → Set: rhythm=1, imperfection=1
#   Failing AI detection?     → Set: rhythm=3, imperfection=3, ai=3, structural=3

# ==============================================================================
# USER CONFIGS - 11-Control System (1-3 Scale)
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Each slider uses 1-3 scale with CLEAR, DISTINCT levels:
#
# 1. author_voice_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Subtle - minimize author personality, keep neutral
#    → 2: Moderate - apply author traits naturally
#    → 3: Strong - emphasize author personality throughout
#
# 2. personality_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: None - no personal opinions or "I" statements
#    → 2: Occasional - some personal perspective where appropriate
#    → 3: Frequent - "I find...", "In my experience..." throughout
#
# 3. engagement_style (1-3)
#    → 1: Formal - no reader address, formal tone
#    → 2: Balanced - occasional "you", mixed formal/conversational
#    → 3: Conversational - direct "you" address, colloquial, friendly
#
# 4. emotional_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Clinical - neutral, objective ("provides", "contains", "measures")
#    → 2: Balanced - appropriate warmth ("helps", "offers", "enables")
#    → 3: Evocative - enthusiastic, powerful ("unlocks!", "transforms", "revolutionizes!")
#
# 5. technical_language_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: None - NO technical specs, qualitative descriptions only
#    → 2: Minimal - 1-2 key specifications when essential
#    → 3: Detailed - 3-5 properties with full technical precision
#
# 6. context_specificity (1-3)
#    → 1: Brief - essential context only (100 chars max)
#    → 2: Moderate - balanced detail (200 chars)
#    → 3: Full - comprehensive context (300 chars)
#
# 7. sentence_rhythm_variation (1-3)
#    → 1: Consistent - similar sentence lengths throughout
#    → 2: Varied - mix of short and medium sentences
#    → 3: Dramatic - wild variation (3-20+ word sentences)
#
# 8. imperfection_tolerance (1-3)
#    → 1: Perfect - flawless grammar and structure
#    → 2: Natural - minor imperfections allowed
#    → 3: Human-like - quirks and natural speech patterns encouraged
#
# 9. structural_predictability (1-3)
#    → 1: Strict - highly constrained, all anti-AI rules enforced
#    → 2: Standard - normal anti-AI rules from prompts
#    → 3: Minimal - maximum creative freedom, minimal constraints
#
# 10. ai_avoidance_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Relaxed - lenient AI detection (0.6 threshold)
#    → 2: Standard - normal detection (0.415 threshold)
#    → 3: Aggressive - strict detection (0.2 threshold)
#
# 11. length_variation_range (1-3)
#    → 1: Tight - stay close to target (±10% variation)
#    → 2: Moderate - reasonable flexibility (±20% variation)
#    → 3: Loose - wide range allowed (±60% variation)
