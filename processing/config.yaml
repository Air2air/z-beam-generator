# 🎚️ ALL SLIDERS NOW USE 1-10 SCALE for granular control
# Lower = More controlled/conservative, Higher = More varied/aggressive
# ALL parameters are normalized to 0.0-1.0 internally for consistent calculations

# Processing Pipeline Configuration
# Simple 11-control system with 1-3 scale for content generation
#
# 🎯 SIMPLE 1-3 SCALE: 1 = Low/Minimal, 2 = Moderate/Balanced, 3 = High/Maximum
#
# ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (1-3 Scale):
#   Content too robotic?      → Set: rhythm=3, imperfection=3, structural=3
#   Output too informal?      → Set: personality=1, engagement=1, imperfection=1
#   Not technical enough?     → Set: technical=3, context=3
#   Too inconsistent?         → Set: rhythm=1, imperfection=1
#   Failing AI detection?     → Set: rhythm=3, imperfection=3, ai=3, structural=3

# ==============================================================================
# USER CONFIGS - 11-Control System (1-3 Scale)
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Each slider uses 1-3 scale with CLEAR, DISTINCT levels:
#
# 1. author_voice_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Subtle - minimize author personality, keep neutral
#    → 2: Moderate - apply author traits naturally
#    → 3: Strong - emphasize author personality throughout
#
# 2. personality_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: None - no personal opinions or "I" statements
#    → 2: Occasional - some personal perspective where appropriate
#    → 3: Frequent - "I find...", "In my experience..." throughout
#
# 3. engagement_style (1-3)
#    → 1: Formal - no reader address, formal tone
#    → 2: Balanced - occasional "you", mixed formal/conversational
#    → 3: Conversational - direct "you" address, colloquial, friendly
#
# 4. emotional_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Clinical - neutral, objective ("provides", "contains", "measures")
#    → 2: Balanced - appropriate warmth ("helps", "offers", "enables")
#    → 3: Evocative - enthusiastic, powerful ("unlocks!", "transforms", "revolutionizes!")
#
# 5. technical_language_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: None - NO technical specs, qualitative descriptions only
#    → 2: Minimal - 1-2 key specifications when essential
#    → 3: Detailed - 3-5 properties with full technical precision
#
# 6. context_specificity (1-3)
#    → 1: Brief - essential context only (100 chars max)
#    → 2: Moderate - balanced detail (200 chars)
#    → 3: Full - comprehensive context (300 chars)
#
# 7. sentence_rhythm_variation (1-3)
#    → 1: Consistent - similar sentence lengths throughout
#    → 2: Varied - mix of short and medium sentences
#    → 3: Dramatic - wild variation (3-20+ word sentences)
#
# 8. imperfection_tolerance (1-3)
#    → 1: Perfect - flawless grammar and structure
#    → 2: Natural - minor imperfections allowed
#    → 3: Human-like - quirks and natural speech patterns encouraged
#
# 9. structural_predictability (1-3)
#    → 1: Strict - highly constrained, all anti-AI rules enforced
#    → 2: Standard - normal anti-AI rules from prompts
#    → 3: Minimal - maximum creative freedom, minimal constraints
#
# 10. ai_avoidance_intensity (1-3)
#    → 1: Relaxed - lenient AI detection (0.6 threshold)
#    → 2: Standard - normal detection (0.415 threshold)
#    → 3: Aggressive - strict detection (0.2 threshold)
#
# 11. length_variation_range (1-3)
#    → 1: Tight - stay close to target (±10% variation)

# Composite Scorer Weights (FALLBACK DEFAULTS ONLY)
# ⚠️  THESE ARE NOT THE ACTUAL WEIGHTS USED IN PRODUCTION ⚠️
#
# The system uses WeightLearner to dynamically learn optimal weights from
# historical correlation data. These config values are ONLY used as fallback
# defaults when insufficient data exists (< 50 generations).
#
# Weight Learning Strategy:
# - Analyzes which metric combinations best predict actual generation success
# - Optimizes weights per material/component context (e.g., "Steel + caption")
# - Continuously adapts as new generations provide more correlation data
# - Example: Winston weight might be 0.7 for captions but 0.5 for FAQs
#
# See: processing/learning/weight_learner.py for learning architecture
#
composite_scorer:
  winston_weight: 0.6        # Fallback: Winston AI detection (primary metric, 60%)
  subjective_weight: 0.3     # Fallback: Claude subjective evaluation (secondary, 30%)
  readability_weight: 0.1    # Readability metrics (tertiary, 10%)

# Manual Subjective Language Penalties (November 16, 2025 Batch Test Findings)
# These patterns were detected in generated content and flagged as AI-like
# PatternLearner will automatically learn from database, but manual overrides here
# ensure immediate penalty application before sufficient training data exists
subjective_violations:
  # Hedging words (ambiguity that sounds AI-generated)
  hedging: ['about', 'around', 'roughly', 'approximately', 'nearly', 'almost']
  
  # Dramatic/emotional verbs (overly vivid for technical content)
  dramatic_verbs: ['smother', 'blasts', 'clears', 'stands', 'waits', 'demands', 'risks', 'zaps', 'gleams']
  
  # Conversational fillers (too casual for professional content)
  conversational: ['now', 'but', 'such', 'really', 'just', 'quite', 'very', 'yeah']
  
  # Perfection language (AI tends toward absolutes)
  emotional_adjectives: ['perfect', 'flawless', 'excellent', 'ideal', 'superior', 'outstanding', 'impressive']
  
  # Intensity adverbs (AI overuses qualifiers)
  intensity_adverbs: ['badly', 'extremely', 'highly', 'significantly', 'remarkably', 'notably', 'particularly', 'especially']

# Subjective Validation Thresholds (November 16, 2025 - Dynamic Implementation)
# Based on batch test analysis: content with 94-99% Winston scores had 5-8 violations
# These are BASE thresholds - actual thresholds adjust dynamically based on Winston scores:
#   - Winston ≥90%: thresholds × 1.5 (allow excellent content more flexibility)
#   - Winston 70-90%: thresholds × 1.0 (standard enforcement)
#   - Winston <70%: thresholds × 0.75 (strict filtering for poor content)
subjective_thresholds:
  max_violations: 6        # Base maximum total violations (dynamically adjusted)
  max_commas: 8            # Base maximum commas (dynamically adjusted)
  # Dynamic adjustment ensures high Winston scores aren't blocked by stylistic rules
  # while poor Winston scores face stricter validation
