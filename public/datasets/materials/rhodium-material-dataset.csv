power,50-500,W,"Typical range for industrial Nd:YAG laser cleaners on reflective metals like Rhodium to balance efficiency and avoid thermal damage; recommended starting at 150W for contamination removal. Rhodium's high reflectivity (~65% at 1064 nm) requires higher power than less reflective substrates. Source: IPG Photonics YLR series specs and studies on PGM cleaning (e.g., Opt. Lasers Eng. 2018)."
