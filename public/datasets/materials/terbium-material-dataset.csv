power,50-300,W,"Typical range for Nd:YAG laser cleaning of reflective metals; starting at 100W to balance ablation and heat input. Terbium's low thermal conductivity (~11 W/mK) requires conservative power to avoid melting (mp 1356°C). Source: Extrapolated from metal cleaning studies (e.g., Kumar et al., Opt. Lasers Eng. 2018); manufacturer specs like IPG Photonics YLR series limit max to prevent substrate damage."
