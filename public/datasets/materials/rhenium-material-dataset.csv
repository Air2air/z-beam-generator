power,50-300,W,"Typical range for industrial cleaning of refractory metals like Rhenium to balance efficiency and avoid thermal damage; recommended starting at 150 W for 1064 nm Nd:YAG lasers. Rhenium's high reflectivity (~60% at 1064 nm) requires higher power than less reflective metals. Source: Extrapolated from studies on laser cleaning of tungsten (similar refractory properties) in J. Laser Appl. 32, 022064 (2020); manufacturer specs from IPG Photonics YLR series."
