power,50-500,W,"Typical range for Nd:YAG laser cleaning of silicates like serpentine to remove contaminants without substrate ablation; starting at 100W for light contamination. Max avoids thermal damage given serpentine's low thermal conductivity (~2 W/m·K). Source: General manufacturer specs (e.g., IPG Photonics systems for stone cleaning) and studies on mineral ablation (e.g., Paljk et al., J. Cult. Herit., 2010)."
