power,10-100,W,"Low power range for delicate ceramics like porcelain to avoid thermal cracking; typical for 1064 nm Nd:YAG systems in heritage and industrial cleaning. Recommended starting at 30 W for light contamination. Max safe ~100 W before risk of substrate damage due to low thermal conductivity (~1.5 W/mK). Source: Manufacturer specs (e.g., CleanLaser CL 50 model) and studies on ceramic restoration (e.g., J. Cult. Herit. 2018)."
