power,50-1000,W,"Typical range for industrial cleaning of nickel-based superalloys like Hastelloy to remove contaminants without ablation; starting at 200W balances efficiency and safety to avoid thermal damage given Hastelloy's high melting point (~1350°C). Max limited to prevent substrate melting at high fluences.
