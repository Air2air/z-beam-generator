power,50-300,W,"Typical range for 1064 nm laser cleaning of wood like Beech to remove contaminants without charring; starting at 150 W balances efficiency and safety. Max avoids thermal damage given Beech's low thermal conductivity (~0.15 W/mK). Source: Studies on Nd:YAG laser cleaning of wooden artifacts (e.g., J. Cult. Herit. 2015, vol. 16, pp. 680-687)."
