power,50-500,W,"Typical range for industrial Nd:YAG laser cleaning of refractory metals like Iridium, starting low due to high reflectivity (~90% at 1064 nm) to avoid excessive heating; max limited to prevent melting (mp 2446°C). Recommended start at 100 W for contamination removal. Source: IPG Photonics specs for YLR series; conservative estimate from metal cleaning studies (e.g., J. Laser Appl. 2018)."
