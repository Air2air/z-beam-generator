power,50-300,W,"Typical range for industrial cleaning of stone materials like Breccia (carbonate-based rock similar to marble) using 1064 nm lasers to remove contaminants without substrate damage; starting at 100 W allows controlled ablation. Max safe ~300 W to avoid cracking due to low thermal conductivity (~2 W/m·K).
