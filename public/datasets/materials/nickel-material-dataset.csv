power,20-300,W,Typical range for pulsed fiber lasers at 1064 nm used in industrial cleaning of reflective metals like nickel; starting at 100 W balances efficiency and safety to avoid thermal damage due to nickel's high reflectivity (~60% at 1064 nm) and thermal conductivity (90 W/m·K). Max safe before substrate melting (1455°C) is ~300 W with short pulses. Source: IPG Photonics YLR series specs and study in Optics and Lasers in Engineering (2018) on metal surface cleaning.
