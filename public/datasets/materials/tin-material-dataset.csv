power,20-500,W,"Typical range for industrial 1064 nm pulsed laser cleaning of reflective metals like tin to balance efficiency and avoid melting (tin melting point ~232°C); starting at 100W for light contamination. Max safe ~300-500W with proper pulsing to prevent substrate damage due to high reflectivity (~70% at 1064 nm).
