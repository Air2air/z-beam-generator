```

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Generate Prompts Only (No Cost)
```bash
python3 scripts/research/populate_region_images.py
# Select: 1
```
- Generates prompts for all regions and counties
- Saves to `regions/data.yaml`
- No images created
- **Cost**: $0

### Option 2: Generate Prompts + Images (~$0.64)
```bash
python3 scripts/research/populate_region_images.py
# Select: 2
```
- Generates prompts
- Creates actual images via Gemini API
- Saves to `public/images/regions/`
- Saves URLs to `regions/data.yaml`
- **Cost**: ~$0.64 (32 images × $0.02)

## 📸 Image Types

Each region/county gets 2 images:

### Historical Photo (4:3 aspect ratio)
- Black and white period photography
- Historical landmarks and architecture
- Era-appropriate details (1920s-1950s)
- Documentary/archival style

### Business Photo (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Modern laser cleaning operation
- Industrial facility setting
- Safety equipment visible
- Professional workplace photography

## 🌍 Coverage

**Current scope**:
- 7 regions × 2 = 14 images
- 9 Bay Area counties × 2 = 18 images
- **Total**: 32 images

**Future expansion** (optional):
- 100+ Bay Area cities × 2 = 200+ images
- Total cost: ~$4.64

## 🔑 API Setup

Required for image generation (Option 2):

```bash
# Install SDK
pip install google-genai

# Set API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Get key from: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
```

## 📊 Cost Breakdown

**Imagen 4 Pricing** (Standard quality):
- Per image: $0.02
- 32 images (7 regions + 9 counties): **$0.64**
- 232 images (all regions + counties + 100 cities): **$4.64**

## 🎯 Output Format

### In regions/data.yaml:
```yaml
regions:
  north_america:
    imagePrompts:
      historical: "Historical photograph from 1950s industrial America..."
      business: "Professional photograph of modern automotive plant..."
    imageFiles:
      historical: "/images/regions/north_america_historical.png"
      business: "/images/regions/north_america_business.png"
```

### File structure:

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Generate prompts** (free, fast, reviewable)
2. **Review and edit** prompts in `regions/data.yaml`
3. **Generate images** (costs money, takes time)
4. **Images available** at `/images/regions/` URLs
5. **Use in frontmatter** for region pages

## 📝 Example Prompts

### Historical (Alameda County):
```
Historical photograph from 1920s Oakland, Alameda County, California. 
Shows downtown area with period architecture and early automotive traffic. 
San Francisco Bay Area documentary style. Vintage California street scene 
with Technology manufacturing facilities visible. Black and white photography, 
archival quality, California historical society style.
```

### Business (Alameda County):
```
Professional photograph of Technology manufacturing facility in Alameda County, 
California. Technician using precision fiber laser cleaning system on industrial 
components. Bay Area high-tech manufacturing environment. Modern California 
workplace with OSHA compliance visible. Professional industrial photography, 
clean lighting, Silicon Valley aesthetic.
```

## 🎨 Next Steps

1. Run prompt generation (Option 1)
2. Review generated prompts
3. Optionally edit prompts for accuracy
4. Run image generation (Option 2)
5. Integrate into region frontmatter generator

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with prompts only** to review before spending money
- **Test with 1-2 regions** first before generating all
- **Edit prompts** to include specific landmarks or details
- **Regenerate specific images** by deleting files and re-running
- **Expand to cities** later after validating county images
