description: Technical overview of Beech, a hardwood known for its strength and aesthetic
  appeal, ideal for laser cleaning applications in woodworking and restoration. Laser
  cleaning of Beech wood involves precise control of laser parameters to ensure effective
  removal of contaminants without damaging the material's natural texture and color.
  This process is particularly useful in preserving the integrity of historical artifacts
  and enhancing the quality of modern woodworking projects.
