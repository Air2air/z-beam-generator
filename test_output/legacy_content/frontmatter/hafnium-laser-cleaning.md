description: Technical overview of Hafnium, a refractory metal with a high melting
  point and excellent corrosion resistance, ideal for laser cleaning applications
  in aerospace and electronics. Hafnium's unique properties, such as its high density
  and thermal conductivity, necessitate specific laser parameters for effective ablation
  and cleaning without compromising the material's integrity. This guide delves into
  optimizing laser cleaning processes for Hafnium, considering its chemical and physical
  characteristics to achieve superior surface treatment results.
