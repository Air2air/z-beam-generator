description: Technical overview of Fir, a softwood species known for its lightweight
  and moderate strength. Fir is commonly used in woodworking and restoration, where
  laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength effectively removes surface contaminants while
  preserving the integrity of the wood. The process, optimized with fluence between
  0.5-5 J/cm² and pulse durations of 10-100ns, facilitates precise cleaning for subsequent
  staining or finishing, and the restoration of historical wooden structures.
