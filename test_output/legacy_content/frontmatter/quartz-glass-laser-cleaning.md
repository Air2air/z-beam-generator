description: Quartz Glass, composed primarily of SiO2, is highly valued for its optical
  clarity and thermal stability in laser cleaning applications. Its excellent transmittance
  across a broad wavelength range, including the 1064 nm used in laser cleaning, makes
  it ideal for precision cleaning of optical components and surfaces without damaging
  the material structure. This material's ability to withstand high temperatures and
  resist chemical attack enhances its suitability for rigorous cleaning processes
  in industries such as semiconductors and photonics.
