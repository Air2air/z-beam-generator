description: Technical overview of Travertine, a type of limestone formed by mineral
  spring deposits, for laser cleaning. Travertine's porous nature and varying density
  make it suitable for laser ablation, allowing precise removal of surface contaminants
  and efflorescence while preserving the integrity of the material. This method enhances
  the restoration and maintenance of travertine surfaces in construction and historical
  preservation applications.
