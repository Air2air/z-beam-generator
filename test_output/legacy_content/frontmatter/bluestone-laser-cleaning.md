description: Technical overview of Bluestone, a robust natural stone, for laser cleaning.
  Bluestone, prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal, is commonly utilized
  in construction and restoration projects. Laser cleaning of Bluestone involves the
  precise removal of contaminants and weathering effects while preserving the stone's
  integrity. This process utilizes a 1064nm wavelength laser with a fluence range
  of 0.5-3.0 J/cm² and pulse durations between 10-50ns, ensuring effective and non-invasive
  surface treatment.
