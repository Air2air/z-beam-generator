description: Technical overview of Plywood for laser cleaning. Plywood, a versatile
  engineered wood product, is effectively cleaned using laser technology. This method
  utilizes non-contact ablation to remove surface contaminants, old finishes, and
  prepare the surface for further treatments like painting or bonding. The process
  ensures minimal damage to the material's structural integrity, making it ideal for
  applications in woodworking and construction.
