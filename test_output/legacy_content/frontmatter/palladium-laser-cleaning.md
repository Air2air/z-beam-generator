description: Palladium (Pd), a lustrous, silvery metal, is effectively cleaned using
  laser technology due to its unique properties. The non-contact nature of laser cleaning
  ensures minimal impact on the delicate microstructure of Pd, making it suitable
  for applications in both automotive and electronics industries. Laser ablation and
  cleaning processes can efficiently remove contaminants and restore the surface integrity
  of Palladium components.
