description: Technical overview of Shale for laser cleaning. Shale, a sedimentary
  rock composed of clay minerals and other fine-grained materials, benefits significantly
  from laser cleaning techniques. The process leverages laser ablation to remove surface
  contaminants and restore the integrity of shale surfaces, critical for both oil
  and gas equipment and architectural applications. This method is non-contact and
  highly precise, ensuring minimal damage to the underlying material.
