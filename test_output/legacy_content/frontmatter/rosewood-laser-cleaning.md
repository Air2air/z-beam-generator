description: Technical overview of Rosewood, a dense and durable tropical hardwood,
  for laser cleaning. Rosewood's rich color and intricate grain patterns make it a
  preferred material in high-end furniture and restoration work. Laser cleaning effectively
  removes contaminants and old finishes from Rosewood surfaces without damaging the
  underlying wood, preserving its aesthetic and structural integrity.
