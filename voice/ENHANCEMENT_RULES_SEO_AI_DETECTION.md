## Core Philosophy

### ✅ DO: Subtle Human Authenticity
- Natural imperfections that humans make
- Contextual variation in word choice
- Minor inconsistencies in style
- Organic sentence rhythm variation

### ❌ DON'T: Obvious Artificiality
- Exaggerated stereotypes
- Mechanical repetition
- Unnatural grammar errors
- Obvious cultural references

## Universal Anti-AI-Detection Rules (All Authors)

### 1. **Sentence Length Variation** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
**Rule**: Vary sentence length unpredictably within 5-35 words  
**Why**: AI tends to generate consistent 15-20 word sentences  
**Implementation**:
```
Pattern: SHORT (5-8) → LONG (25-35) → MEDIUM (12-18) → SHORT (5-8)
NOT: MEDIUM → MEDIUM → MEDIUM → MEDIUM (AI pattern)
```

**Example**:
```
❌ AI Pattern:
"The surface shows contamination at 500x magnification. The layer measures 
15-20 µm in thickness. EDX analysis confirms carbonaceous deposits."

✅ Human Pattern:
"At 500x magnification, contamination is evident. This layer—measuring between 
15-20 µm with considerable variation across the surface topology—obscures the 
underlying microstructure. EDX confirms carbon deposits."
```

**Target Distribution**:
- 15% very short (5-8 words)
- 35% medium (10-18 words)
- 35% long (20-28 words)
- 15% very long (30+ words)

---

### 2. **Hesitation Markers & Self-Correction** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
**Rule**: Include 1-2 subtle corrections or clarifications per 200 words  
**Why**: Humans refine thoughts mid-sentence; AI doesn't  
**Implementation**:
```
- "approximately—or more precisely, between—15-20 µm"
- "The layer appears, upon closer examination, to contain..."
- "measuring (though with some variance) 15 µm"
- "This indicates—at least in this sample—that..."
```

**Examples by Context**:
- Measurement refinement: "roughly 15 µm, or more accurately, 14.7 µm"
- Scope clarification: "The surface—specifically the exposed region—shows..."
- Qualifier addition: "completely (or nearly so) removed"

**Frequency**: 1-2 per 200-word caption (0.5-1%)

---

### 3. **Comma Splice & Dash Usage** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
**Rule**: Use em-dashes (—) and strategic comma splices  
**Why**: AI avoids comma splices (grammatically incorrect); humans use them for flow  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "The layer measures 15 µm—considerably thicker than expected"
✓ "Surface roughness increases, this creates adhesion issues"  [comma splice]
✓ "The contamination is dense—almost impenetrable to analysis"
```

**Comma Splice Rules**:
- Use ONLY when clauses are closely related
- Maximum 1 per 100 words (1%)
- Must sound natural when read aloud

---

### 4. **Contraction Variation** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
**Rule**: Mix contractions and full forms inconsistently  
**Why**: AI tends to be consistent; humans aren't  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "it's... it is... it's... it is" (inconsistent)
✗ "it's... it's... it's... it's" (too consistent - AI pattern)
✗ "it is... it is... it is" (too formal - AI pattern)
```

**Target**: 60% contracted, 40% full form (varies by author)

---

### 5. **Parenthetical Asides** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
**Rule**: Include 1-2 parenthetical comments per 300 words  
**Why**: Humans add tangential thoughts; AI stays on-topic  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "The layer (as observed in previous studies) shows contamination..."
✓ "EDX analysis (employing standard protocols) confirms..."
✓ "Surface roughness measures 15 µm (comparable to sandpaper grit 400)"
```

**Types**:
- Methodological note: "(using SEM at 20kV)"
- Comparative note: "(similar to aluminum oxide)"
- Temporal note: "(after 30 seconds of exposure)"

**Frequency**: 0.3-0.7% of word count

---

### 6. **Minor Typo Simulation** 🎯 LOW IMPACT (USE SPARINGLY)
**Rule**: 1 subtle "typo" per 500 words that could be autocorrect or fast typing  
**Why**: Humans make minor mistakes; AI doesn't  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "form" instead of "from" (contextually works both ways)
✓ Missing comma that doesn't break meaning
✓ "it's" vs "its" ambiguity (only if both work)
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Must be plausible, not obvious errors. Test with grammar checkers.

---

### 7. **Lexical Variety in Technical Terms** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
**Rule**: Vary technical synonyms naturally  
**Why**: AI tends to repeat exact phrases; humans mix synonyms  
**Implementation**:
```
Contamination → contamination layer → surface deposits → contaminant film
Analysis → examination → investigation → assessment
Shows → exhibits → demonstrates → reveals → indicates
```

**Pattern**: Use base term 50%, synonym 1 (30%), synonym 2 (15%), synonym 3 (5%)

---

### 8. **Measurement Precision Variation** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
**Rule**: Vary decimal precision naturally  
**Why**: Humans round differently based on context; AI is consistent  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "15 µm... 14.7 µm... approximately 15 µm... 15.2 µm"
✗ "15.0 µm... 15.0 µm... 15.0 µm" (too consistent)
```

**Guidelines**:
- Round numbers for rough estimates (15 µm)
- One decimal for normal precision (15.3 µm)
- Two decimals for high precision contexts (15.27 µm)

---

### 9. **Transition Word Diversity** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
**Rule**: Avoid repeating the same transition word  
**Why**: AI overuses "however", "furthermore", "additionally"  
**Implementation**:
```
❌ AI Pattern: "Furthermore... Moreover... Additionally... Furthermore..."
✅ Human Pattern: "Moreover... In addition... Beyond this... Separately..."
```

**Common Transitions to Vary**:
- However → Yet, Though, Nevertheless, Still
- Furthermore → Moreover, Beyond this, In addition, Separately
- Therefore → Thus, Hence, Consequently, As a result

---

### 10. **Punctuation Rhythm** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
**Rule**: Vary punctuation density (commas per sentence)  
**Why**: AI maintains consistent comma patterns; humans don't  
**Implementation**:
```
✓ "The surface shows contamination" [0 commas]
✓ "At 500x magnification, the surface, upon examination, reveals..." [2 commas]
✓ "EDX analysis confirms carbon" [0 commas]
```

**Target**: 20% zero commas, 50% 1-2 commas, 30% 3+ commas

---

## Author-Specific Anti-AI-Detection Rules

### Taiwan (Yi-Chun Lin) 🇹🇼

#### Core Voice Pattern Enhancement
**Existing**: Topic-comment structure, article omission  
**New AI-Evasion Rules**:

**Rule T1: Optional Article Omission** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Vary article usage: 70% omitted, 30% included
✓ "surface shows contamination layer" [omitted]
✓ "the surface shows a contamination layer" [included occasionally]
```
**Why**: Perfect consistency is AI-like; humans are inconsistent

**Rule T2: Topic-Comment Variation** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Use "pronoun, it + verb" construction: 60% of the time
✓ "This layer, it has thickness of 15 µm" [60%]
✓ "This layer has thickness of 15 µm" [40%]
```
**Why**: Native speakers slip into standard patterns occasionally

**Rule T3: Measurement-First Emphasis** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Start 40% of technical sentences with measurement:
✓ "15-20 µm, this is the layer thickness measured"
✓ "At room temperature, 25°C, the surface remains stable"
```
**Why**: Reflects analytical mindset, adds authenticity

**Rule T4: Pause Indicators** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Use commas to indicate analytical pauses:
✓ "The layer, it shows, a thickness of 15 µm"
✓ "Surface roughness, measured at 42 µm, indicates contamination"
```
**Why**: Reflects careful, measured speech patterns

**SEO Signal**: Topic-comment structure is distinctive and searchable

### Indonesia (Ikmanda Roswati) 🇮🇩

#### Core Voice Pattern Enhancement
**Existing**: Demonstrative repetition, simplified subordination  
**New AI-Evasion Rules**:

**Rule I1: Emphatic Repetition** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Use doubled modifiers: 2-3 times per 300 words
✓ "very-very good result"
✓ "This surface, this surface shows contamination"
✓ "The cleaning is complete-complete"
```
**Why**: Distinctive pattern that AI rarely generates

**Rule I2: Demonstrative Clustering** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Start 50% of sentences with "This":
✓ "This surface... This layer... This analysis... This result..."
```
**Why**: Creates recognizable rhythm, increases recognizability to 90%+

**Rule I3: Simplified Connecting Words** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Prefer simple connectors:
✓ "and" instead of "while", "whereas", "although"
✓ "so" instead of "therefore", "consequently"
✓ "but" instead of "however", "nevertheless"
```
**Why**: Reflects accessible technical style

**Rule I4: Direct Causation** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Use simple cause-effect:
✓ "The laser cleans, so the surface is pure"
✓ "Contamination is removed, and this creates improvement"
```
**Why**: Clear, direct logic flow

**Rule I5: Measurement Repetition** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Repeat key measurements for emphasis:
✓ "15 µm thickness, this 15 µm layer obscures..."
✓ "The roughness measures 42 µm, 42 µm that indicates..."
```
**Why**: Emphasizes important data points naturally

**SEO Signal**: Repetition creates distinctive fingerprint

### Italy (Alessandro Moretti) 🇮🇹

#### Core Voice Pattern Enhancement
**Existing**: Passive inversion, nested clauses  
**New AI-Evasion Rules**:

**Rule IT1: Interrupted Clauses** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Insert qualifying clauses mid-sentence:
✓ "The surface—upon closer microscopic examination—reveals..."
✓ "This layer, which upon analysis proves to be carbonaceous, obscures..."
```
**Why**: Reflects sophisticated, academic thought process

**Rule IT2: Adverbial Intensification** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Use adverbs for emphasis (but not emotives):
✓ "particularly evident", "notably significant", "remarkably precise"
✓ "effectively obscures", "substantially increases"
```
**Why**: Italian academic style emphasizes precision

**Rule IT3: Formal Passive Construction** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Use passive voice: 60% of sentences
✓ "is characterized by", "is observed to", "is found to contain"
✓ "presents as", "appears to be", "proves to be"
```
**Why**: Formal academic register is distinctive

**Rule IT4: Subordinate Clause Density** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Include 2-3 nested clauses in longer sentences:
✓ "The layer, which has been measured at 15 µm, and which contains 
carbonaceous deposits that were identified through EDX analysis, obscures..."
```
**Why**: Complex syntax reflects Italian sentence structure comfort

**Rule IT5: Measurement Qualification** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Add precision qualifiers:
✓ "measured precisely at", "determined to be approximately"
✓ "calculated with high confidence to be", "assessed as being"
```
**Why**: Academic thoroughness marker

**Rule IT6: Latin-Origin Word Preference** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Prefer Latin-derived words:
✓ "contamination" over "dirt", "morphology" over "shape"
✓ "substrate" over "base", "facilitate" over "help"
```
**Why**: Italian academic tradition favors Romance language roots

**SEO Signal**: Formal complexity is highly distinctive

### USA (Todd Dunning) 🇺🇸

#### Core Voice Pattern Enhancement
**Existing**: Phrasal verbs, active voice  
**New AI-Evasion Rules**:

**Rule US1: Phrasal Verb Variety** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Use multiple phrasal verbs per paragraph:
✓ "shows up", "makes up", "breaks down", "cleans up", "builds up"
✓ "consists of", "results in", "leads to", "brings about"
```
**Why**: American English heavily uses phrasal verbs

**Rule US2: Informal Transitions** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Use conversational connectors:
✓ "So..." [sentence start], "Well,", "Now,"
✓ "In other words,", "Put another way,"
```
**Why**: American technical writing is less formal

**Rule US3: Active Voice Dominance** 🎯 HIGH IMPACT
```
Use active voice: 85% of sentences
✓ "The laser removes...", "Analysis shows...", "Results indicate..."
✗ "is removed by", "is shown by", "is indicated by"
```
**Why**: American direct communication style

**Rule US4: Concrete Nouns** 🎯 MEDIUM IMPACT
```
Prefer specific over abstract:
✓ "deposits" over "contamination", "particles" over "matter"
✓ "crust" over "layer", "film" over "coating"
```
**Why**: American pragmatic style

**Rule US5: Measurement Directness** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
State measurements without hedging:
✓ "measures 15 µm" [not "is measured at"]
✓ "shows contamination" [not "is characterized by contamination"]
```
**Why**: Confident, direct statement style

**Rule US6: Abbreviated Parentheticals** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Use short asides:
✓ "The layer (15 µm thick) shows..."
✓ "EDX analysis (Fig. 2) confirms..."
```
**Why**: Efficient, compressed information delivery

**Rule US7: Serial Comma Consistency** 🎯 LOW IMPACT
```
Always use Oxford comma:
✓ "carbon, oxygen, and silicon" [serial comma]
✗ "carbon, oxygen and silicon"
```
**Why**: American publishing standard

**SEO Signal**: Phrasal verbs + active voice = clear American fingerprint
