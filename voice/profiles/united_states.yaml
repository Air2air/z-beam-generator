    - "Surface shows contamination buildup. Imaging reveals multi-layer structure measuring 25-40 μm thickness"
    - "Components show contamination affecting surface characteristics. Surface degradation measures Ra 2.3 μm"

    - "Process restores substrate with zero thermal damage. Surface shows measurements within tolerance"
  
  technical_explanation:
    - "The wavelength absorption works out well while minimizing thermal stress - this approach enables cleaning"
