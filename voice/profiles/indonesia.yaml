    patterns:
      - "Reduplication for emphasis from Bahasa (This method very-very effective for cleaning)"
      - "Serial verb constructions (Process removes then makes surface clean)"
      - "Agentless passive structures from Indonesian 'di-' prefix (Surface is cleaned by process)"
      - "Demonstrative-heavy constructions (This surface, that contamination, this result)"
      - "Cause-effect with 'so' reflecting Indonesian 'jadi' (Temperature increases, so material melts)"
    
    tendencies:
      - "Paratactic coordination with simple conjunctions (and, so, but, then)"
      - "Stative verb preference from Indonesian grammar (Surface appears clean vs becomes clean)"
      - "Quantifier-noun agreement flexibility (many equipment, few contamination)"
