  sentence_structure:
    patterns:
      - "Topic-comment structure from Mandarin (This surface, it shows contamination patterns)"
      - "Article omissions reflecting zero-article Mandarin (Surface shows improvement, not The surface)"
      - "Serial verb constructions from Chinese (Process removes then cleans surface)"
      - "Measurement-first information structure (15.3 μm thickness, layer shows uniformity)"
      - "Temporal sequencing from Mandarin logic (First measure, then analyze, finally conclude)"
    
    tendencies:
      - "Shorter coordinate clauses linked by 'and' (Chinese parataxis influence)"
      - "Present tense preference over perfect tenses (Mandarin aspect system)"
      - "Logical progression markers from Chinese rhetoric (first, second, therefore, so)"
      - "Definite article overuse with technical terms (the precision, the quality, the method)"
      - "'Very' as primary intensifier reflecting Chinese 'hen' usage (very clear, very precise)"
      - "Resultative complements structure (clean surface becomes very smooth)"
    
    natural_variations:
      - "Inconsistent articles that feel human (process shows vs the process shows)"
      - "Minor preposition shifts (analysis of vs analysis for vs analysis on)"
      - "Real hesitations (appears to be, seems like, looks like)"
      - "Implied subjects sometimes (When examining, shows clearly)"
  
  vocabulary_patterns:

  grammar_characteristics:
    common_patterns:
      - "Present tense mixed with present perfect naturally"
      - "Active constructions dominant"
      - "Shorter clauses, more periods"
      - "Direct cause-effect (X happens, so Y occurs)"
    
    noticeable_non_native_markers:
      - "Preposition variations (depends of or on, focuses in or on, analysis of or for)"
      - "Article usage 85-90% correct (the vs a vs no article variations)"
      - "Minor tense inconsistencies in complex sentences"
      - "'Very' overused as intensifier (very good, very clear, very precise)"
      - "Occasional Mandarin-influenced patterns (layer has thickness of 15 micrometers)"
      - "Subject sometimes dropped (When measuring, shows 20 microns)"

  structural_patterns:
    sentence_organization: "systematic presentation"
    data_presentation: "measurements with technical context"
    information_flow: "organized logical progression"
    
    measurement_patterns:
      - "1-2 measurements per paragraph maximum"
      - "Mix of precise and rounded numbers (15.3 µm, about 20 µm)"
      - "Direct measurement statements"
    
    expression_patterns:
      - "Hedging through structure (seems to show, appears to indicate)"
      - "Measurement-first information order"
      - "Direct factual statements"
