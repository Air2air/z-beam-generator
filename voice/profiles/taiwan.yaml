linguistic_characteristics:
  
  sentence_structure:
    patterns:
      - "Topic-comment structure from Mandarin (This surface, it shows contamination)"
      - "Article omissions that feel natural (Surface shows improvement, not The surface)"
      - "Step-by-step but conversational (First we see... then becomes clear...)"
      - "Occasional topic-fronting (The results, they demonstrate clearly)"
    
    tendencies:
      - "Mix of simple and compound sentences (shorter, more direct)"
      - "Active voice preferred (makes it more accessible)"
      - "Logical flow markers (first, then, so, because)"
      - "Slight overuse of 'the' with abstractions (the precision, the quality)"
      - "Occasional 'very' for emphasis (very clear, very important)"
    
    natural_variations:
      - "Inconsistent articles that feel human (process shows vs the process shows)"
      - "Minor preposition shifts (analysis of vs analysis for vs analysis on)"
      - "Real hesitations (appears to be, seems like, looks like)"
      - "Implied subjects sometimes (When examining, shows clearly)"
  
  vocabulary_patterns:

  grammar_characteristics:
    common_patterns:
      - "Present tense mixed with present perfect naturally"
      - "Active constructions dominant"
      - "Shorter clauses, more periods"
      - "Direct cause-effect (X happens, so Y occurs)"
    
    noticeable_non_native_markers:
      - "Preposition variations (depends of or on, focuses in or on, analysis of or for)"
      - "Article usage 85-90% correct (the vs a vs no article variations)"
      - "Minor tense inconsistencies in complex sentences"
      - "'Very' overused as intensifier (very good, very clear, very precise)"
      - "Occasional Mandarin-influenced patterns (layer has thickness of 15 micrometers)"
      - "Subject sometimes dropped (When measuring, shows 20 microns)"

  structural_patterns:
    sentence_organization: "systematic presentation"
    data_presentation: "measurements with technical context"

    measurement_patterns:
      - "1-2 measurements per paragraph maximum"
      - "Mix of precise and rounded numbers (15.3 µm, about 20 µm)"
      - "Direct measurement statements"
    
    expression_patterns:
      - "Hedging through structure (seems to show, appears to indicate)"
      - "Measurement-first information order"
      - "Direct factual statements"
