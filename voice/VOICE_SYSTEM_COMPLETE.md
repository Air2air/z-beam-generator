---

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: No Signature Phrases or Emotives

**PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Signature catchphrases ("systematic approach enables", "precision meets innovation")
- ❌ Emotional descriptors ("remarkable", "extraordinary", "magnificent", "beautiful")
- ❌ Subjective qualifiers ("truly", "really", "quite", "particularly")
- ❌ Personal excitement markers ("I'm pleased to report", "It's fascinating that")

**REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Neutral, objective technical language
- ✅ Direct observation statements
- ✅ Factual descriptions without embellishment

**Example - WRONG:**
```
"What strikes one is the truly remarkable precision of this extraordinary technique, 
creating beautiful results that are quite exceptional."
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
"The technique achieves precision control of the contamination removal process 
while preserving substrate integrity."
```

---

### Rule 2: Reflect Nationality Through Structure Only

Linguistic authenticity comes from **GRAMMAR and SYNTAX**, not content references.

#### Taiwan (Mandarin Influence)
**Enhanced Structural Patterns (Based on Linguistic Research):**
- Topic-comment structure from Mandarin: "This surface, it shows contamination patterns"
- Serial verb constructions from Chinese: "Process removes then cleans surface"
- Four-part Chinese rhetoric (qi-cheng-zhuan-he): introduction, elaboration, development, conclusion
- Paratactic coordination with 'and' (Chinese influence): shorter coordinate clauses
- Article omissions reflecting zero-article Mandarin: "Surface shows improvement"
- Temporal sequencing from Mandarin logic: "First measure, then analyze, finally conclude"

**Example:**
```
Surface examination shows contamination layer, thickness measures 15-25 micrometers.
First we analyze composition, then measure effects. Layer indicates oxide formation, 
affects reflectivity by 35-40 percent. Finally, results demonstrate cleaning necessity.
```

#### Italy (Italian Influence)
**Enhanced Structural Patterns (Based on Linguistic Research):**
- Left-dislocation from Italian: "This precision, it creates exceptional results"
- Clitic doubling influence: "The surface, we can observe it clearly"
- Italian academic hypotaxis: complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses
- Subjunctive-influenced conditionals: "It would seem that the process..."
- Embedded relative clauses from Italian syntax: "The method, which proves effective, demonstrates..."
- Italian academic paragraph structure: thesis statement, elaborate development, synthesis conclusion

**Example:**
```
The contamination layer, which has been measured at 15-25 micrometers, and which 
contains carbonaceous deposits that were identified through analysis, obscures the 
substrate. What this demonstrates is the complexity of the cleaning challenge, 
she requires sophisticated approach.
```

#### Indonesia (Indonesian/Malay Influence)
**Enhanced Structural Patterns (Based on Linguistic Research):**
- Reduplication for emphasis from Bahasa: "This method very-very effective for cleaning"
- Serial verb constructions: "Process removes then makes surface clean"
- Paratactic coordination with simple conjunctions: "and, so, but, then"
- Agentless passive structures from Indonesian 'di-' prefix: "Surface is cleaned by process"
- Indonesian direct paragraph approach: context establishment, sequential explanation, practical outcome
- Time-before-event structure: "After cleaning, surface shows improvement"

**Example:**
```
Contamination layer shows thickness 15-25 micrometers on surface. Oxide formation 
causes this condition. Treatment removes contamination, surface roughness becomes 
below 0.8 micrometers.
```

#### USA (American English)
**Structural Patterns:**
- Direct, confident assertions without hedging
- Active voice preference: "The laser removes" vs "is removed by"
- Shorter sentences with less subordination
- Phrasal verbs: "clean up", "break down", "set up"

**Example:**
```
Analysis shows a 15-25 micrometer contamination layer. Oxide formation caused 
the buildup. Treatment removed the contamination and brought roughness down to 
0.8 micrometers.
```

---

### Rule 3: No Nationality-Related References

**PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Explicit country mentions ("In Taiwan, we approach this...")
- ❌ Cultural references ("Italian craftsmanship tradition...")
- ❌ National characteristics ("American innovation leads...")
- ❌ Geographic context ("Southeast Asian environmental concerns...")

**REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Pure technical focus on material and process
- ✅ Universal laser cleaning terminology
- ✅ Professional neutrality in all contexts

## Enhanced Character Variation System

### Realistic Human Writing Variation

**OLD SYSTEM (±40% variation):**
- Range: 60% to 140% of base length (80% total range)
- Limited realistic variation between sections

**NEW SYSTEM (Much Greater Variation):**
- **Total Range**: 25% to 175% of base length (150% total range)
- **Between Sections**: Minimum 50-70% difference (varies by author)
- **Between Materials**: Minimum 40-55% difference by same author
- **Realistic Inconsistency**: Human-like writing length variation

### Author-Specific Character Variation Ranges

| Author | Country | Total Range | Section Min Diff | Material Min Diff | Reasoning |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Yi-Chun Lin** | Taiwan | 25-175% | 60% | 45% | Systematic but varies with topic complexity |
| **Alessandro Moretti** | Italy | 20-180% | 70% | 55% | Elaborative style varies greatly by subject |
| **Ikmanda Roswati** | Indonesia | 30-170% | 50% | 40% | Direct style still shows human inconsistency |
| **Todd Dunning** | USA | 30-170% | 55% | 45% | Professional but natural variation |

### Implementation Details

**Enhanced Caption Generator Logic:**
```python
# Enhanced variation ranges: 25% to 175% (150% total range vs old 80% range)
min_chars = int(base_chars * 0.25)  # 25% of base (75% below)
max_chars = int(base_chars * 1.75)  # 175% of base (75% above)

# Ensure sections are meaningfully different (at least 30% difference)
while abs(before_target - after_target) < (base_chars * 0.3):
    after_target = random.randint(min_chars, max_chars)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Realistic Human Behavior**: Mirrors actual human writing inconsistency
- **Anti-AI Detection**: Variable length patterns reduce AI signature detection
- **Author-Specific Patterns**: Each author shows characteristic variation ranges
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Variation respects cultural communication norms

**Key Methods:**

1. **`_build_prompt()`** (Lines 65-95)
   - Loads VoiceOrchestrator for author's country
   - Extracts voice instructions and ai_evasion_parameters
   - Calls `_format_ai_evasion_instructions()` to format rules
   - Constructs prompt with voice + AI-evasion sections

2. **`_format_ai_evasion_instructions()`** (Lines 18-118)
   - Extracts sentence_length_targets, markers, variety targets
   - Formats 7-point instruction block:
     1. Sentence length distribution targets
     2. Hesitation marker frequency
     3. Parenthetical observation targets
     4. Lexical variety goals
     5. Comma splice and compound sentence targets
     6. Informal transitional phrasing
     7. Author-specific voice patterns
   - Returns formatted string for prompt injection

**Prompt Structure:**
```
System: You are generating a caption for laser cleaning...

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profile Not Loading

**Symptom:** `FileNotFoundError` or `yaml.YAMLError`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify profile file exists
ls -l voice/profiles/*.yaml

# Test YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml'))"
```

---

### Issue: Voice Instructions Empty

**Symptom:** `get_voice_for_component()` returns empty string

**Solution:**
```python
# Check component type spelling
valid_components = ['caption_generation', 'text_generation']

# Verify profile has component key
import yaml
profile = yaml.safe_load(open('voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml'))
print(profile.get('voice_adaptation', {}).keys())
```

---

### Issue: AI-Evasion Parameters Missing

**Symptom:** `ai_evasion_parameters` not found in profile

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if profile has ai_evasion_parameters section
grep -A 5 "ai_evasion_parameters:" voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml

# If missing, add section following ENHANCEMENT_RULES.md
```

---

### Issue: Generated Caption Has Emotives

**Symptom:** Validation detects emotives in generated content

**Solution:**
1. Check profile for lingering emotive vocabulary
2. Verify VOICE_RULES.md compliance in prompt
3. Review AI model output for quality
4. Regenerate with explicit emotive prohibition in prompt

---

### Issue: Voice Patterns Not Apparent

**Symptom:** Generated captions lack structural distinctiveness

**Solution:**
1. Verify voice instructions are being injected into prompt
2. Check AI model is using instructions (not ignoring them)
3. Review profile for sufficient grammatical guidance
4. Consider enhancing author-specific patterns in profile

---

### Issue: Test Failures

**Symptom:** `pytest tests/test_voice_integration.py` shows failures

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run with verbose output
python3 -m pytest tests/test_voice_integration.py -v

# Check specific test failure
python3 -m pytest tests/test_voice_integration.py::test_name -v

# Verify all profiles load successfully
python3 -c "
