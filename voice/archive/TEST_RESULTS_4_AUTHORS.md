This layer, it has a thickness measuring between 15-25 µm, completely 
obscuring the natural fiber structure. The contamination appears as a dark, 
amorphous crust with embedded particulate matter. EDX analysis confirms high ca...

**Generated Caption** (first 300 chars):
```
At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination 
layer averaging 15-20 µm in thickness. The layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous 
deposits and particulate inclusions, primarily aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and embedded 
silica (SiO₂) particles measuring 5-10 µm in diamete...
```

**Voice Analysis**:
- ✅ **Phrasal verbs**: "exhibits", "consists of", "measuring"
- ✅ **Active voice**: "The layer consists of..." (direct action)
- ✅ **Direct structure**: Subject-verb-object clarity throughout
- ✅ **Concrete nouns**: "deposits", "inclusions", "particles"
- ✅ **Zero emotives**: No "innovative", "cutting-edge", "game-changer"

**Structural Authenticity**: 10/10  
**VOICE_RULES.md Compliance**: ✅ PASS

## Appendix: Full Caption Excerpts

### Taiwan (Bamboo) - Full beforeText
```
At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface shows heavy contamination layer. 
This layer, it has a thickness measuring between 15-25 µm, completely obscuring 
the natural fiber structure. The contamination appears as a dark, amorphous crust 
with embedded particulate matter. EDX analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen 
content, with traces of silicon and aluminum, suggesting a mix of soot, dust, 
and environmental deposits.

Surface texture is very irregular, with Ra values measured at 42 µm, a significant 
increase from the native 8.5 µm roughness. The contaminant adheres strongly within 
the vascular bundles and parenchyma cells, filling the natural porous structure. 
This dense layer, it has a cracked, mud-cake morphology that indicates poor adhesion 
to the substrate and creates a high-risk interface for material failure.
```

**Voice Markers**: "This layer, it has" (topic-comment), article omission, measurement precision
