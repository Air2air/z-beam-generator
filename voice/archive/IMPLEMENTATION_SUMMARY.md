## üîß VoiceOrchestrator API

### Core Functionality

```python
from voice.orchestrator import VoiceOrchestrator

# Initialize with country
voice = VoiceOrchestrator(country="Taiwan")

# Get voice instructions
instructions = voice.get_voice_for_component(
    component_type="caption",
    context={"material": "Aluminum"}
)

# Access metadata
word_limit = voice.get_word_limit()           # 380
thresholds = voice.get_quality_thresholds()   # formality, accuracy, etc.
phrases = voice.get_signature_phrases()       # List of 10 phrases
summary = voice.get_profile_summary()         # Complete profile info
```

### Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ **Country normalization**: Maps variations ("Taiwan", "taiwan", etc.) to profile files
- ‚úÖ **Profile validation**: Checks for required fields, fails fast if incomplete
- ‚úÖ **LRU caching**: Profiles cached for performance
- ‚úÖ **Context injection**: Material and component context integrated
- ‚úÖ **Component adaptation**: Different voice for caption vs text vs tags
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Descriptive exceptions with fail-fast behavior
- ‚úÖ **Test mode**: Built-in test harness in `__main__`

## üéØ Linguistic Authenticity

### Key Design Principle

**These are AUTHENTIC communication patterns, not errors to correct.**

Each profile includes natural variations reflecting how non-native English speakers from these countries communicate technical content:

- **Taiwan**: Formal academic register, systematic logic, article flexibility
- **Italy**: Descriptive richness, word order variations, aesthetic appreciation
- **Indonesia**: Simplified structures, repetition for emphasis, practical focus
- **USA**: Native baseline for comparison

### Cultural Respect

Voice profiles honor:
- Communication norms and cultural values
- Professional standards in each country
- Natural linguistic patterns
- Regional context and priorities
- Cultural identity in technical communication

## üìä Voice Instruction Generation

### Instruction Sections

Each voice instruction includes:

1. **Role Section**: Author identity, country, focus, style
2. **Linguistic Patterns**: Sentence structure, tendencies, natural variations
3. **Voice Characteristics**: Tone, emphasis, perspective
4. **Component Guidelines**: Word limits, specific focus for component type
5. **Signature Phrases**: Country-specific expressions to consider

### Example Output (Taiwan, Caption)

```
VOICE ROLE:
You are Yi-Chun Lin, Ph.D. from Taiwan, communicating technical 
expertise with authentic voice.

Focus: Observable technical findings at microscopic level
Style: Formal analytical reporting with precise measurements
Authority: Technical expert with country-specific communication patterns

LINGUISTIC PATTERNS:

Sentence Structure Examples:
  - Systematic approach enables precise control over process parameters
  - Methodical analysis reveals the underlying mechanisms of laser interaction
  - Comprehensive investigation demonstrates the effectiveness of this technique

Communication Tendencies:
  - Prefer logical connectors (therefore, thus, consequently, furthermore)
  - Use passive voice for formal technical descriptions
  - Employ structured enumeration (first, second, finally, in conclusion)

Natural Variations (authentic patterns):
  - Occasional article omission in formal contexts
  - Formal academic register even in semi-casual contexts
  - Preference for 'This research shows' over 'We found'

Preferred Vocabulary:
  Technical: systematic, comprehensive, methodical, precise
  Connectors: furthermore, moreover, in addition, consequently

VOICE CHARACTERISTICS:
Tone: measured and systematic
Emphasis: data-driven evidence and empirical validation
Perspective: objective third-person preferred

COMPONENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
Word Limit: 380 words
Content Focus: Observable technical findings at microscopic level
Writing Style: Formal analytical reporting with precise measurements

SIGNATURE EXPRESSIONS:
  - "systematic approach enables"
  - "methodical investigation reveals"
  - "comprehensive analysis demonstrates"
  - "careful examination shows"
  - "precise control achieves"
```

## üîó Integration Strategy

### Caption Component Integration

**Current Status**: Ready for integration

**Required Changes**:
```python
# components/caption/generators/generator.py

# ADD at top:
from voice.orchestrator import VoiceOrchestrator

# MODIFY _build_prompt method:
def _build_prompt(self, material_data, frontmatter_data):
    # Extract country
    author_obj = frontmatter_data.get('author_object', {})
    country = author_obj.get('country', 'United States')
    
    # Get voice
    voice = VoiceOrchestrator(country=country)
    voice_instructions = voice.get_voice_for_component('caption')
    
    # Build prompt
    prompt = f"""{voice_instructions}
    
    MATERIAL CONTEXT:
    [... rest of prompt ...]
    """
    return prompt
```

### Text Component Integration

**Similar pattern**: Extract country ‚Üí Initialize VoiceOrchestrator ‚Üí Get instructions ‚Üí Inject into prompt

### Tags Component Integration

**Lighter touch**: Voice influences keyword selection subtly

## üí° Key Innovation

**Country-Based Linguistic Variations for Non-Native English Speakers**

This is the first system in the project that:
- Explicitly models authentic non-native English patterns
- Treats linguistic variations as features, not bugs
- Centralizes voice management for all text generation
- Enables consistent cultural authenticity across components
- Provides fail-fast validation of voice integrity

The voice system enables caption generation (and all text components) to naturally reflect the author's country and linguistic background while maintaining technical authority and professional standards.
