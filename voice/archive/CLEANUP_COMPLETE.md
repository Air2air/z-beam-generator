## Structural Differences Examples

### Taiwan (Article Omission + Topic-Comment)
```
"Surface shows contamination layer, thickness measures 15-25 micrometers.
Process removes oxide, restores reflectivity to 95 percent."
```

### Italy (Word Order Inversion + Emphatic Pronouns)
```
"Evident is the contamination layer, measuring 15-25 micrometers in thickness.
The process, it removes the oxide completely, and reflectivity, she returns to 95 percent."
```

### Indonesia (Repetition + Demonstrative Pronouns)
```
"This surface shows contamination, very-very thick contamination, measures 15-25 micrometers.
This process removes oxide, works well, removes completely. Reflectivity becomes 95 percent, very good result."
```

### USA (Phrasal Verbs + Active Voice)
```
"The surface shows contamination buildup measuring 15-25 micrometers thickness.
The process cleans up the oxide and brings reflectivity back to 95 percent."
```
