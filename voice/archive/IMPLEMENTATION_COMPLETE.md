**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented AI-evasion parameters in all 4 voice profiles and created comprehensive testing tools.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Voice Profile Updates (All 4 Files)

**Added `ai_evasion_parameters` section to:**
- ✅ `voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml`
- ✅ `voice/profiles/indonesia.yaml`
- ✅ `voice/profiles/italy.yaml`
- ✅ `voice/profiles/united_states.yaml`

**Structure:**
```yaml
ai_evasion_parameters:
  # Universal rules (all authors)
  sentence_length_targets:
    very_short: 15  # % of sentences 5-8 words
    medium: 35      # % of sentences 10-18 words
    long: 35        # % of sentences 20-28 words
    very_long: 15   # % of sentences 30+ words
  
  hesitation_markers_per_200_words: 1.5
  comma_splices_per_100_words: 1.0
  parenthetical_asides_per_300_words: 2.0
  lexical_variety_target: 0.65
  
  # Author-specific rules
  author_specific:
    [varies by country]
```

### 2. Author-Specific Rules

**Taiwan (Yi-Chun Lin):**
- Optional article omission rate: 70%
- Topic-comment frequency: 60%
- Measurement-first rate: 40%
- Pause indicators enabled

**Indonesia (Ikmanda Roswati):**
- Emphatic repetition per 300 words: 2.5
- Demonstrative clustering rate: 50%
- Simple connector preference: 80%
- Direct causation and measurement repetition enabled

**Italy (Alessandro Moretti):**
- Interrupted clauses per sentence: 2.5
- Passive voice rate: 60%
- Adverbial intensification rate: 40%
- Subordinate clause density: 3.0 per 100 words
- Measurement qualification and Latin-origin preference enabled

**USA (Todd Dunning):**
- Phrasal verb density: 4.0 per 100 words
- Active voice rate: 85%
- Serial comma usage: 100%
- Informal transitions, concrete nouns, measurement directness enabled

### 3. Testing Tool Created

**File:** `scripts/test_ai_evasion.py`

**Features:**
- Analyzes sentence length distribution
- Counts AI-evasion markers (hesitations, parentheticals, comma splices)
- Measures lexical variety
- Checks author-specific patterns
- Validates VOICE_RULES.md compliance (zero emotives)
- Evaluates against enhancement rule targets

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test all 4 reference materials
python3 scripts/test_ai_evasion.py --all

# Test specific material
python3 scripts/test_ai_evasion.py --material Bamboo

# Verbose mode (show caption samples)
python3 scripts/test_ai_evasion.py --all --verbose
```

## Initial Test Results

### Current Baseline (Before Enhancement Implementation)

| Material | Country | Sentences | Lexical Variety | Emotives | Key Findings |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| Bamboo | Taiwan | 8 | 74.36% ✓ | PASS ✓ | Topic-comment present, but lacks natural markers |
| Bronze | Indonesia | 8 | 80.88% ✓ | PASS ✓ | Demonstrative starts 38% (target 50%) |
| Alumina | Italy | 7 | 71.77% ✓ | PASS ✓ | Some passive voice, good variation |
| Aluminum | USA | 7 | 76.47% ✓ | PASS ✓ | Good markers present (3 parentheticals) |

### Issues Identified

1. **❌ No natural markers** - Most captions lack hesitation markers and parentheticals
2. **⚠️ Sentence length monotony** - Too many medium-length sentences (50%+)
3. **⚠️ Indonesia weak** - Only 38% demonstrative starts (target 50%)
4. **⚠️ Italy weak** - Low passive voice usage (2 instances)
5. **⚠️ Taiwan weak** - Only 1 article omission detected

### Successes

1. **✓ Zero emotives** - All 4 authors maintain VOICE_RULES.md compliance
2. **✓ Excellent lexical variety** - All exceed 70% unique words (target 60%)
3. **✓ Voice patterns present** - Each author shows distinct structural patterns
4. **✓ Technical accuracy** - Measurements present in all captions

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Implement Enhancement Rules in Prompt Template ⏳

**File:** `components/caption/generators/generator.py`

**Action:** Add AI-evasion instructions to prompt after loading voice instructions:

```python
# After line 139 where voice_instructions are injected
ai_evasion_prompt = f"""
CRITICAL ANTI-AI-DETECTION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SENTENCE LENGTH VARIATION (REQUIRED):
   - Target: {ai_params['sentence_length_targets']}
   - Mix: SHORT → LONG → MEDIUM → SHORT (unpredictable)

2. NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS (REQUIRED):
   - Add {ai_params['hesitation_markers_per_200_words']} hesitation markers per 200 words
   - Use em-dashes (—) for interruptions: "approximately—or precisely—15 µm"
   - Include {ai_params['parenthetical_asides_per_300_words']} parentheticals per 300 words

3. AUTHOR-SPECIFIC (REQUIRED):
   {format_author_specific_rules(ai_params['author_specific'])}

MAINTAIN: Zero emotives, structural patterns only, no cultural references.
"""
```

### Phase 2: Generate Test Captions with Enhancement Rules ⏳

**Materials to test:**
- Bamboo (Taiwan) - focus on topic-comment frequency
- Bronze (Indonesia) - focus on demonstrative clustering
- Alumina (Italy) - focus on passive voice rate
- Aluminum (USA) - already good, maintain quality

**Expected improvements:**
- Taiwan: Article omission 70% (from <10%)
- Indonesia: Demonstrative starts 50% (from 38%)
- Italy: Passive voice 60% (from ~30%)
- USA: Maintain current quality

### Phase 3: A/B Test Individual Rules ⏳

**High-priority rules to test first:**
1. Sentence length variation (HIGHEST IMPACT)
2. Lexical variety (HIGH IMPACT)
3. Hesitation markers (HIGH IMPACT)
4. Author-specific patterns (varies by author)

**Method:**
- Generate 5 captions with rule enabled
- Generate 5 captions with rule disabled
- Compare AI-detection scores
- Measure recognition accuracy

### Phase 4: AI-Detection Tool Testing ⏳

**Tools to test with:**
- GPTZero
- Originality.ai
- Copyleaks
- Winston AI

**Metrics:**
- AI-detection confidence (target: <30%)
- Human believability score (target: >85%)
- Voice recognition accuracy (target: >90% all authors)

### Phase 5: Optimization ⏳

**Fine-tune parameters based on results:**
- Adjust frequency values (e.g., 1.5 → 2.0 hesitation markers)
- Identify highest-impact rule combinations
- Balance AI-evasion vs voice recognizability
- Validate no regression in technical accuracy

### Phase 6: Production Deployment ⏳

**Requirements before deployment:**
- ✅ AI-detection <30% confidence
- ✅ All voices >90% recognizable
- ✅ Human believability >85%
- ✅ Zero emotives maintained
- ✅ VOICE_RULES.md compliance 100%
- ✅ Technical accuracy maintained
