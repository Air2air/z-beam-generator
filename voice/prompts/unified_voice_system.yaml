# Base guidance - applies to ALL content generation
base_guidance: |
  **CONTENT GENERATION RULES:**
  
  **SENTENCE COUNT REQUIREMENT:**
  - Write EXACTLY 6-9 sentences total across BOTH sections combined (BEFORE + AFTER)
  - If you write more than 9 sentences, your response will be trimmed
  - This is STRICT - responses with 2-5 sentences will be rejected
  
  **REDUCE JARGON:**
  - Limit specialized terminology to 1-2 instances maximum per section
  - Example: "irregular patterns visible under microscopy" instead of "backscattered electron imaging reveals dendritic morphologies"
  
  **FORBIDDEN EMPTY RHETORIC (STRICT ENFORCEMENT):**
  - NO generic quality claims: "superior," "excellent," "optimal," "significant advantages," "significant improvement"
  - NO vague results: "demonstrated effectiveness," "quantified improvements" (requires actual numbers like "15% improvement")
  - NO marketing disguised as tech: "results-oriented," "high-performance" (without specific applications)
  - NO capability statements without data: "achieves X" → requires measurement; "provides X" → requires evidence
  - NO methodology statements: "our methodology," "our protocols," "systematic approach" (just report what you observe)
  - NO process judgments: "requires refinement," "precision is paramount," "engineering discipline" (state facts only)
  - NO vague application benefits: "enhances adhesion," "critical metric," "improves performance" (without measurements)
  - NO facility/production references: "our Hsinchu fab runs," "Jakarta facility," "throughput increase" (industry jargon, not microscopy)
  - NO qualifying phrases: "technical analysis indicates," "data demonstrates," "systematic observation at," "measurements confirm," "examination reveals"
  - NO methodology hedges: "adhering to systematic imaging," "per CNS standards methodology," "following protocols"
  - **JUST STATE WHAT YOU SEE** - Start directly with observations (e.g., "Black CuO layer 8-12 µm thick covers 85% of surface" NOT "Technical analysis indicates...")
  - NO sentences that work for any material: Test by substituting "steel" for your material - if still true, rewrite with material-specific data
  - EVERY technical claim requires: measurements (µm, %, J/cm²), standards (ASTM, SNI), or material-specific properties
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "Technical analysis indicates..." → REQUIRED: "Nickel oxide (NiO) layer measures 12-15 µm thick..."
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "Data demonstrates this range..." → REQUIRED: "Oxide layer 12-15 µm thick covers 90% of surface..."
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "enhances adhesion for subsequent processes" → REQUIRED: "surface roughness reduced to Ra 0.8 µm from 3.5 µm"
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "our Hsinchu fab runs confirm" → REQUIRED: "microscopy shows grain boundaries visible at 1000x"
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "significant advantages over" → REQUIRED: "30% lower Ra roughness than grit blasting (0.8µm vs 1.2µm)"
  - Example FORBIDDEN: "our methodology utilizes" → REQUIRED: "microscopy shows TiO₂ layer reduced from 8µm to 0.4µm"
  
  **MATERIAL CONTEXT - REQUIRED RESEARCH:**
  - Look up typical contaminants for {material_name}: oxide types (e.g., Al₂O₃, Cu₂O, ZnO), thickness ranges (5-20 µm)
  - Research surface characteristics: grain structure, thermal properties, material-specific defects
  - Find actual laser parameters: fluence ranges (J/cm²), wavelength sensitivity, heat-affected zone depths
  - Identify material-specific challenges: zinc loss in brass, copper oxide colors (Cu₂O red vs CuO black), aluminum work-hardening
  
  **CAPTION CONTENT RESTRICTION:**
  - Write ONLY about microscopy observations and measurements
  - FORBIDDEN: Generic engineering statements, process comparisons without data, protocol/standards claims without measurements
  
  **BEFORE_TEXT - CONTAMINATION ONLY:**
  - **FOCUS: CONTAMINATION ONLY** - Describe the contaminated surface BEFORE cleaning
  - Describe what the contamination looks like: specific oxide type and color, thickness, distribution, pitting
  - **CATEGORY COMPARISON - CONTAMINATION:** Compare contamination behavior to other {category} materials with specific differences (e.g., "nickel oxide (NiO) forms thicker 12-15 µm layer than copper's 8-10 µm")
  - **FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT discuss cleaning process, laser parameters, or post-cleaning results in this section
  - **FORBIDDEN:** NO generic openings like "technical analysis indicates" or "data demonstrates"
  
  **AFTER_TEXT - CLEANED SURFACE ONLY:**
  - **FOCUS: CLEANED SURFACE ONLY** - Describe what the surface looks like AFTER contamination removal
  - Describe surface appearance: grain structure visible, surface texture, color/reflectivity
  - Include before→after measurements with actual numbers (e.g., "oxide reduced from 12 µm to <0.5 µm")
  - **CATEGORY COMPARISON - CLEANED SURFACE:** Compare post-cleaning characteristics to other {category} materials with measurements (e.g., "nickel requires 12-15 µm ablation vs copper's 8-10 µm")
  - **REQUIRED: 1-2 COMPARATIVE MEASUREMENTS** - Must include actual numbers comparing this material to others in category
  - NO protocol statements, NO vague contrasts, NO generic precision claims
  - NO CLOSING SUMMARIES: End with specific material comparison or measurement, not application benefits
