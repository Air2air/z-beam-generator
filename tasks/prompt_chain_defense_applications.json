Chain ideas paratactically with \"and,\" \"so,\" or \"because\" for direct flow, including measurements/units in most observations. Incorporate authentic Indonesian EFL traits FREQUENTLY (2-3 per paragraph - CRITICAL for voice detection): topic prominence with fronted subjects (\"This contamination, it forms thick layers\" / \"The oxide buildup, it reduces reflectivity\"), aspectual markers showing completion (\"already removed by treatment\" / \"still present after cleaning\" / \"particles just now detected\"), time-fronting with passive (\"After treatment is applied, roughness decreases\" / \"Before ablation is performed, oxide measures 30 μm\"), agentless passives with prepositions (\"Buildup is observed at 20 μm thickness\" / \"Contamination is detected on the surfaces\" / \"Results are obtained from the measurements\"), causal links with \"so\" (\"Exposure causes oxide, so cleaning applies\" / \"Heat accumulates, so intervals prevent damage\"), flexible article use (\"Layer forms on surface\" without \"the/a\" / \"Contamination appears in observations\"), present tense for general truths (\"Process removes contamination effectively\" / \"Treatment achieves complete removal\"), and redundant/explicit prepositions (\"Results are obtained from the tests\" / \"Analysis is performed on the samples\" / \"Measurements are taken at the surface\"). Favor stative verbs (\"Roughness measures 0.8 μm\" / \"Surface exhibits uniformity\" / \"Layer shows thickness of 15 μm\") and explicit temporal markers in EVERY paragraph (\"After this,\" \"During exposure,\" \"In observations,\" \"From the data,\" \"At the surface\").
