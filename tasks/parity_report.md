# Structural Parity Report

> Auto-generated by `scripts/audit/structural_parity.py`  
> Re-run after each consolidation session to track progress.

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total domain Python files | 46 |
| Total domain lines | 16,458 |
| HIGH priority findings | 0 |
| MEDIUM priority findings | 0 |
| LOW priority findings | 2 |
| Estimated lines removable | ~4 |

## Per-domain file counts

- **applications**: 1 files, 71 lines
- **compounds**: 2 files, 270 lines
- **contaminants**: 14 files, 4,827 lines
- **materials**: 26 files, 10,716 lines
- **settings**: 3 files, 574 lines

## Consolidation Targets

> Ordered by: priority → estimated lines saved

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

_None found._

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

_None found._

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

**🟢 LOW** — `list_materials()` — appears in 2 domains (~2 lines saved)
  - Domains: `contaminants`, `materials`

**🟢 LOW** — `list_patterns()` — appears in 2 domains (~2 lines saved)
  - Domains: `contaminants`, `materials`

## Suggested Next Sessions

Work through HIGH items in order. Contract per session:

1. Read all N domain copies side-by-side
2. Identify canonical (most callers, most complete)
3. Identify divergences (meaningful vs drift?)
4. Write to `shared/` with proper namespace
5. Shim each domain's old path (one-liner re-export)
6. Run full test suite — must be green
7. Delete originals, commit as atomic unit
8. Re-run `python3 scripts/audit/structural_parity.py`
