## 🎯 Core Principle

**Store minimal references + relationship-specific metadata ONLY.**

Never duplicate data that belongs to the target item's own frontmatter file.

---

## 📋 Relationship Structure Template

### ✅ CORRECT: Minimal Reference
```yaml
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: blood-residue-contamination          # REQUIRED: Unique identifier
    frequency: occasional                     # OPTIONAL: Relationship-specific
    severity: low                            # OPTIONAL: Relationship-specific
    typical_context: Breakdown of proteins   # OPTIONAL: Relationship-specific
```

### ❌ WRONG: Duplicated Data
```yaml
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: blood-residue-contamination
    title: Biological Blood Residue         # ❌ NEVER - belongs in contaminant's file
    category: biological                     # ❌ NEVER - belongs in contaminant's file
    description: "Blood residue..."         # ❌ NEVER - belongs in contaminant's file
    image: /images/blood-residue.jpg        # ❌ NEVER - belongs in contaminant's file
    url: /contaminants/biological/...       # ❌ NEVER - generated from ID
```

## 📚 Field Definitions

### **REQUIRED Fields**

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier matching target's frontmatter ID | `blood-residue-contamination` |

### **RELATIONSHIP-SPECIFIC Fields** (Optional)

These describe the **relationship itself**, not the target item:

| Field | Type | Description | Example | Valid Values |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `frequency` | string | How often this relationship occurs | `occasional` | `very_common`, `common`, `occasional`, `rare` |
| `severity` | string | Impact level of this relationship | `low` | `low`, `moderate`, `high`, `critical` |
| `typical_context` | string | When/why this relationship happens | `Breakdown of proteins` | Any descriptive text |

### **FORBIDDEN Fields** 

Never include these - they belong in the target's own frontmatter:

- ❌ `title` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `name` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `category` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `subcategory` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `description` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `image` - Fetched from target's frontmatter
- ❌ `url` - Generated from ID
- ❌ `href` - Generated from ID

## 🔗 Relationship Types by Content Type

### **Compounds** (hazardous byproducts)

```yaml
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: paint-contamination
    frequency: common
    severity: high
    typical_context: Thermal decomposition of organic binders
  
  produced_from_materials:
  - id: pvc-plastic-laser-cleaning
    frequency: common
    severity: critical
    typical_context: Chlorine release during ablation
```

### **Contaminants** (surface residues)

```yaml
relationships:
  produces_compounds:
  - id: hydrogen-chloride-compound
    frequency: common
    severity: high
    typical_context: PVC decomposition products
  
  found_on_materials:
  - id: steel-laser-cleaning
    frequency: common
    severity: moderate
    typical_context: Common substrate for rust formation
```

### **Materials** (laser cleaning substrates)

```yaml
relationships:
  contaminated_by:

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Data Flow Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Compound YAML           │
│ (ammonia-compound.yaml) │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ produced_from_contaminants│
│ - id: blood-residue...  │ ← Minimal reference
│   frequency: occasional │ ← Relationship metadata
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            │ Server-side enrichment
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Contaminant YAML        │
│ (blood-residue-...yaml) │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ name: Blood Residue     │ ← Fetched dynamically
│ category: biological    │ ← Fetched dynamically
│ description: ...        │ ← Fetched dynamically
└─────────────────────────┘
            │
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Enriched Card Data      │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ id: blood-residue...    │
│ frequency: occasional   │ ← From relationship
│ name: Blood Residue     │ ← From target file
│ category: biological    │ ← From target file
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Server-Side Enrichment (Automatic)

The system automatically enriches minimal references:

```typescript
// In CompoundsLayout.tsx
const enrichedContaminants = await Promise.all(
  sourceContaminants.map(async (linkage) => {
    const fullData = await getContaminantArticle(linkage.id);
    return {
      ...linkage,                      // Keep: id, frequency, severity
      category: fullData.category,     // Add: from target's file
      description: fullData.description // Add: from target's file
    };
  })
);
```

**You don't need to worry about this** - just provide the minimal references correctly.

### Frontmatter Structure (Current Implementation)

Frontmatter preserves the flat array structure with minimal references:

```yaml
# What you provide in source data:
relationships:
  contaminated_by:
  - id: rust-contamination
    frequency: very_common
  - id: oil-contamination
    frequency: common

# What appears in frontmatter (same structure):
relationships:
  contaminated_by:
  - id: rust-contamination
    frequency: very_common
  - id: oil-contamination
    frequency: common
      metal_oxides:
        items:
        - id: rust-contamination
          title: Metal Oxidation / Rust  # Auto-enriched
          frequency: very_common
      organic_residues:
        items:
        - id: oil-contamination
          title: Oil Contamination  # Auto-enriched
          frequency: common
```

**Key Point**: You provide flat arrays, the system handles grouping and enrichment.

## 📐 Validation Rules

### ✅ Valid Relationship Entry

**Must have**:
- `id` field matching an existing item's frontmatter ID

**May have**:
- `frequency` - describes relationship occurrence
- `severity` - describes relationship impact
- `typical_context` - explains when/why relationship exists

**Must NOT have**:
- Any field that duplicates target item's data
- Any field not in the allowed list above

### Example Validation

```yaml
# ✅ VALID
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: oil-contamination
    frequency: common
    severity: moderate

# ❌ INVALID - has forbidden fields
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: oil-contamination
    title: Oil Contamination        # ❌ Remove - in contaminant's file
    category: organic-residue       # ❌ Remove - in contaminant's file
    frequency: common               # ✅ Keep - relationship-specific
```

## 🎨 Display Architecture

### Relationship Card Variants

The Card component automatically detects content type and displays appropriate metadata:

**Contaminant Cards** (variant="relationship"):
- Category: biological deposit
- Severity: low
- Context: Breakdown of proteins

**Compound Cards** (variant="relationship"):
- Formula: NH₃
- CAS: 7664-41-7
- Hazard: corrosive

**Settings Cards** (variant="relationship"):
- Power: 100W
- Frequency: 20kHz

### Visual Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Relationship Card          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  CATEGORY    biological     │
│  ────────────────────────   │
│  SEVERITY    low            │
│  ────────────────────────   │
│  CONTEXT     Protein breakdown │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

No image - metadata emphasizes the important data subsets for UX.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Copying Full Data
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - id: blood-residue-contamination
    title: Biological Blood Residue    # Remove this
    category: biological               # Remove this
    description: "Blood residue..."    # Remove this
    frequency: occasional              # Keep this
```

**Fix**: Remove title, category, description.

### Mistake 2: Including URLs
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG
relationships:
  optimized_for_materials:
  - id: steel-laser-cleaning
    url: /materials/metal/ferrous/steel-laser-cleaning  # Remove this
    frequency: common                                    # Keep this
```

**Fix**: System generates URLs from IDs automatically.

### Mistake 3: Missing ID
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG
relationships:
  produced_from_contaminants:
  - frequency: common                  # No ID!
    severity: high
```

**Fix**: ID is mandatory - every relationship needs it.

### Mistake 4: Wrong Relationship Type
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - compound using wrong key
relationships:
  related_contaminants:  # Should be produced_from_contaminants
  - id: blood-residue-contamination
```

**Fix**: Use correct relationship key for content type (see table above).

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Contaminants → Materials Link Breakage

**Problem**: `found_on_materials` relationships use generic material IDs that don't exist.

**Examples of Broken IDs**:
- `wood-laser-cleaning` → Actual files: `plywood-laser-cleaning`, `redwood-laser-cleaning`, `rosewood-laser-cleaning`
- `steel-laser-cleaning` → Actual files: `steel-alloy-4340-laser-cleaning`, `steel-alloy-1020-laser-cleaning`, etc.
- `aluminum-laser-cleaning` → File exists ✅ (this one is correct)

**Impact**: ~800 broken links prevent contaminant pages from showing related materials cards.

**Root Cause**: Frontmatter generation used category-level generic names instead of actual file IDs.

**Solution Required**: Regenerate `found_on_materials` relationships with valid material file IDs. Options:
1. Use most common material variant for each category (e.g., `plywood-laser-cleaning` for wood)
2. Include multiple specific materials per contaminant (e.g., list all wood types)
3. Remove invalid relationships until regeneration

**Validation Command**: 
```bash
/tmp/validate_relationships.sh
```

## 🚀 Summary

**DO**:
- Store minimal references (ID + relationship metadata)
- Use relationship-specific fields (frequency, severity, typical_context)
- Let server-side enrichment fetch display data

**DON'T**:
- Duplicate target item's data (title, category, description)
- Store URLs/paths (generated from IDs)
- Include fields that belong in target's file

**WHY**:
- Single source of truth
- Easy maintenance
- Small file sizes (-40% reduction)
- Enables server-side enrichment
- Automatic data sync

---

## 📞 Questions?

If unclear about any field, ask:
1. **Does this describe the relationship** (frequency/severity/context)? → Include it
2. **Does this describe the target item** (title/category/description)? → Exclude it
3. **Can this be generated** (URL/path)? → Exclude it

**When in doubt**: Include only `id` field. Additional fields can be added later if needed.
