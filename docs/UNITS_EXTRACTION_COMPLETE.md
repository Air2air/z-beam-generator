# Units Extraction Completed

## What Was Done

Successfully performed units extraction on `data/Categories.yaml`, separating numerical values from their units into separate keys for cleaner data structure.

## Transformation Example

**Before (Original Format):**
```yaml
density:
  max: 15.7 g/cm³
  min: 1.8 g/cm³
hardness:
  max: 10 Mohs
  min: 6 Mohs
```

**After (Units Extracted):**
```yaml
density:
  max: 15.7
  min: 1.8
  unit: g/cm³
hardness:
  max: 10
  min: 6
  unit: Mohs
```

## Processing Results

- ✅ **9 categories processed** (ceramic, composite, glass, masonry, metal, plastic, semiconductor, stone, wood)
- ✅ **All properties transformed** with units extracted to separate keys
- ✅ **Inconsistent units handled** (warnings logged for composite hardness: HRC/Shore D, metal hardness: HB/HV)
- ✅ **Backup created** at `data/Categories_backup.yaml`
- ✅ **Schema validation passed** after transformation

## Benefits of Units Extraction

1. **Cleaner Data Structure**: Numerical values are now pure numbers, not strings
2. **Better Programmatic Access**: Can perform mathematical operations on values directly
3. **Consistent Unit Handling**: Units are clearly separated and standardized
4. **Schema Compliance**: Maintains compatibility with existing validation
5. **Type Safety**: Numbers are proper numeric types (int/float) instead of strings

## Files Modified

- `data/Categories.yaml` - Transformed with units extracted
- `data/Categories_backup.yaml` - Original version preserved
- `scripts/tools/extract_units.py` - Units extraction tool created

## Validation Status

✅ The transformed Categories.yaml passes all validation checks and maintains full compatibility with existing systems.

The units extraction has been completed successfully and the database is ready for use with the new cleaner structure.
