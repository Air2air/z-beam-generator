caption:
  before: "Under scanning electron microscopy, the aluminum surface prior to laser cleaning reveals a pretty degraded microstructure, marked by fairly thick adherent oxide layers, scattered carbonaceous particulates, and localized corrosion pitting. Surface irregularities such as microcracks and clustered contaminants obscure the polycrystalline grain structure, worsening oxidative damage and lowering material reflectivity."
  
  after: "After laser cleaning, the aluminum surface delivers pretty superior restoration quality, featuring a clean, homogeneous topography free of residual oxides or particulates, as seen in microscopic imaging. Material integrity holds up intact, shown by preserved grain boundaries, fairly minimal ablation-induced roughness, and no thermal microcracks. Overall, this approach creates a smooth, low-porosity substrate with boosted specular reflectance, proving solid contaminant removal while preserving the metal's microstructural stability and mechanical properties."
