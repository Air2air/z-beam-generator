{'content': "When laser cleaning aluminum, we've found that its high reflectivity poses an early risk of energy bounce-back, so start by ensuring protective shielding around the workspace to prevent stray beam hazards. This reflective nature means the laser energy absorbs poorly at first, which can slow down the cleaning process if not addressed. We typically adjust settings to use shorter pulses that build heat gradually, allowing the surface to warm without immediate melting. Aluminum's lightweight structure helps here, as it conducts heat quickly across thin sections, reducing hot spots once absorption improves. To avoid warping on delicate parts, keep passes light and monitor for any discoloration that signals overheating. This approach restores the metal's smooth finish effectively while exposing underlying contaminants without deep damage. In our experience, overlapping scans by half the beam width ensures even removal of oxides, improving adhesion for later coatings in aerospace or automotive applications.", 'length': 1015, 'word_count': 148, 'saved': True, 'temperature': 0.8150000000000001}
