# Content Component Generation Scoring System 📊

## Overview

The Content Component Generator now includes a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates each generated content piece across multiple dimensions to ensure **100% believable human-generated content** as required. This system provides detailed metrics for validation, retry decisions, and quality assurance.

## Scoring Architecture

### Core Quality Metrics (0-100 scale)

1. **Overall Score** - Weighted composite of all metrics
2. **Human Believability** - Natural language flow and authenticity  
3. **Technical Accuracy** - Domain expertise and formula integration
4. **Author Authenticity** - Persona-specific linguistic markers
5. **Readability Score** - Sentence structure and vocabulary diversity
6. **Formatting Quality** - Markdown structure and presentation

### Content Metrics

- **Word Count** - Total words in generated content
- **Sentence Count** - Number of sentences
- **Paragraph Count** - Number of paragraphs  
- **Average Sentence Length** - Words per sentence
- **Vocabulary Diversity** - Unique words / total words ratio
- **Technical Density** - Technical terms / total words ratio

### Validation Flags

- **Has Required Elements** - All essential components present
- **Passes Human Threshold** - Meets minimum believability score (default: 75/100)
- **Retry Recommended** - Whether content should be regenerated

## Usage Example

```python
from components.content.fail_fast_generator import create_fail_fast_generator
from api.client import GrokAPIClient

# Initialize with scoring enabled
generator = create_fail_fast_generator(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=1.0,
    enable_scoring=True,
    human_threshold=75.0  # Minimum human believability score
)

# Generate content with comprehensive scoring
result = generator.generate(
    material_name='316L Stainless Steel',
    material_data={'formula': 'Fe-18Cr-10Ni-2Mo'},
    api_client=api_client,
    author_info={'id': 1, 'name': 'Dr. Li Wei', 'country': 'Taiwan'},
    frontmatter_data={
        'properties': {'corrosion_resistance': 'Excellent'},
        'laser_cleaning': {'wavelength': '1064nm'}
    }
)

# Access comprehensive scoring
if result.success and result.quality_score:
    score = result.quality_score
    
    print(f"Overall Score: {score.overall_score:.1f}/100")
    print(f"Human Believability: {score.human_believability:.1f}/100")
    print(f"Technical Accuracy: {score.technical_accuracy:.1f}/100")
    print(f"Author Authenticity: {score.author_authenticity:.1f}/100")
    print(f"Passes Human Threshold: {score.passes_human_threshold}")
    print(f"Retry Recommended: {score.retry_recommended}")
```
