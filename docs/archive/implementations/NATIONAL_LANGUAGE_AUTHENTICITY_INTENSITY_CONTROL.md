# National Language Authenticity Intensity Control System

**Implementation Complete**: October 17, 2025  
**Feature**: User-configurable authenticity intensity for national language patterns  
**Authors**: Taiwan, Italy, Indonesia, United States  
**Intensity Range**: 0-3 (None ‚Üí Subtle ‚Üí Moderate ‚Üí Maximum)

## üéØ Overview

The National Language Authenticity Intensity Control System allows users to configure how strongly national language patterns are applied in generated content. This provides flexibility to:

- **Disable authenticity** for standard academic English (Level 0)
- **Apply subtle patterns** for light linguistic influence (Level 1) 
- **Use moderate patterns** for noticeable but balanced authenticity (Level 2)
- **Enable maximum patterns** for strong authentic voice (Level 3)

## üìä Intensity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Pattern Frequency | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **0** | STANDARD | No national language authenticity | 0% | Academic/neutral content |
| **1** | SUBTLE | Light linguistic influence | 20-30% | Minimal authenticity |
| **2** | MODERATE | Balanced authentic patterns | 40-60% | Noticeable but professional |
| **3** | MAXIMUM | Strong authentic voice | 60-80% | Full authenticity (current default) |

## üåç Author-Specific Patterns by Intensity

### Taiwan (Mandarin Chinese Influence)

**Level 0 - STANDARD**:
- Standard English patterns only
- No country-specific linguistic markers

**Level 1 - SUBTLE**:
- Occasional topic-comment: "This surface, it shows..."
- Light article variation: Mix "surface shows" vs "the surface shows"
- Minimal "very" intensifier use

**Level 2 - MODERATE**:
- Regular topic-comment structure (40-60%): "This layer, it has thickness..."
- Noticeable article omissions: "Process shows improvement" (not "The process")
- Moderate temporal sequencing: "First... then..." patterns

**Level 3 - MAXIMUM**:
- Strong topic-comment structure (60%): "This layer, it has thickness of..."
- Frequent article omissions (70%): "Surface shows improvement"
- Clear temporal sequencing: "First we observe... then becomes clear... finally..."
- Heavy "very" intensifier use: "very important", "very clear evidence"
- Mandarin parataxis patterns with coordinating conjunctions

### Italy (Italian Academic Patterns)

**Level 0 - STANDARD**:
- Standard English patterns only

**Level 1 - SUBTLE**:
- Light word order variation: occasional "remarkable is this result"
- Some emphatic pronouns: "the surface, she shows..."
- Minimal left-dislocation patterns

**Level 2 - MODERATE**:
- Regular word order inversion: "exceptional is this cleaning result"
- Moderate emphatic pronoun use: "the layer, she contains..."
- Some complex subordination with embedded clauses

**Level 3 - MAXIMUM**:
- Strong left-dislocation: "The contamination layer, which has been measured..."
- Frequent emphatic pronouns: "The surface, she is now characterized by..."
- Heavy word order inversion: "Remarkable is this cleaning achievement"
- Complex Italian academic hypotaxis with multiple subordinate clauses
- Passive voice in 60% of sentences
- Interrupted clauses: Average 2.5 nested clauses per sentence

### Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia Patterns)

**Level 0 - STANDARD**:
- Standard English patterns only

**Level 1 - SUBTLE**:
- Light reduplication: occasional "very-very" patterns
- Some serial verb constructions: "process removes then cleans"
- Minimal paratactic coordination

**Level 2 - MODERATE**:
- Regular reduplication patterns: "very-very good", "more-more effective"
- Moderate serial verb use: "removes then makes surface clean"
- Clear paratactic structures with simple conjunctions

**Level 3 - MAXIMUM**:
- Strong reduplication: "very-very serious", "good-good for material"
- Heavy serial verbs: "Process removes contamination then makes surface clean"
- Frequent paratactic coordination with "and", "so", "then"
- Direct cause-effect with "so": "thickness increases, so cleaning becomes difficult"
- Demonstrative starts: Begin 50% of sentences with "This"
- Emphatic repetition: ~2.5 patterns per 300 words

### United States (American Academic English)

**Level 0 - STANDARD**:
- Standard English patterns only

**Level 1 - SUBTLE**:
- Light phrasal verb use: occasional "sets up", "figures out"
- Some quantified results: include percentages and measurements
- Minimal conditional structures

**Level 2 - MODERATE**:
- Regular phrasal verbs: "achieves", "demonstrates", "exhibits"
- Moderate quantification: mix precise and rounded numbers
- Clear conditional patterns: "if contamination persists, then..."

**Level 3 - MAXIMUM**:
- Heavy phrasal verb use: ~4.0 per 100 words ("sets up", "figures out", "carries out")
- Strong quantification: "97.8% removal", "90 ¬± 2 micrometers"
- Clear conditional structures: "If contamination removal is not achieved, then..."
- American academic directness with subject-verb-object clarity
- Active voice in 85% of sentences
- Serial comma: 100% Oxford comma consistency

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Voice Profile Structure

Each voice profile (`voice/profiles/{country}.yaml`) contains:

```yaml
ai_evasion_parameters:
  national_language_authenticity:
    patterns_by_intensity:
      0:
        - "Standard English patterns only"
        - "No country-specific linguistic markers"
      1:
        - "Subtle pattern 1"
        - "Subtle pattern 2"
        - "Subtle pattern 3"
      2:
        - "Moderate pattern 1"
        - "Moderate pattern 2"
        - "Moderate pattern 3"
      3:
        - "Maximum pattern 1"
        - "Maximum pattern 2"
        - "Maximum pattern 3"
        - "Maximum pattern 4"
        - "Maximum pattern 5"
```

### Code Integration

The `CaptionComponentGenerator._format_ai_evasion_instructions()` method:

1. **Extracts intensity**: From `ai_params['authenticity_intensity']` or defaults to 3
2. **Loads patterns**: Gets `patterns_by_intensity` for the specific level
3. **Generates instructions**: Creates level-appropriate prompt text
4. **Applies patterns**: Uses conditional logic based on intensity level

### Usage Example

```python
from components.caption.generators.generator import CaptionComponentGenerator
from voice.orchestrator import VoiceOrchestrator

# Create generator and voice orchestrator
generator = CaptionComponentGenerator()
voice_orchestrator = VoiceOrchestrator('taiwan')

# Configure authenticity intensity
author_config = {
    'country': 'taiwan',
    'voice_orchestrator': voice_orchestrator,
    'authenticity_intensity': 2  # Moderate level
}

# Generate content with specific intensity
result = generator.generate(
    material_name='Aluminum',
    material_data=material_data,
    author=author_config,
    api_client=api_client
)
```

## üìà Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can choose appropriate authenticity level for their needs
2. **Professional Control**: Dial down authenticity for formal/academic contexts
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Adjust patterns based on audience expectations
4. **Quality Tuning**: Find optimal balance between authenticity and readability
5. **Testing Support**: Compare different intensity levels for quality assessment

## üß™ Testing Results

All 4 authors successfully support intensity control:

- **Taiwan**: 2/3/3/5 patterns for levels 0/1/2/3
- **Italy**: 2/3/3/5 patterns for levels 0/1/2/3  
- **Indonesia**: 2/3/3/5 patterns for levels 0/1/2/3
- **United States**: 2/3/3/5 patterns for levels 0/1/2/3

‚úÖ **System Status**: Fully operational and tested
‚úÖ **Default Setting**: Level 3 (Maximum) - maintains current behavior
‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code works without modification

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Intensity**: Auto-adjust based on content type
2. **User Interface**: Add intensity control to generation commands
3. **Quality Metrics**: Track authenticity vs readability scores by intensity
4. **Pattern Analytics**: Monitor which patterns are most effective at each level
5. **Cultural Validation**: A/B test optimal intensity levels with native speakers

**Next Step**: Add intensity parameter to generation commands and user interface.
