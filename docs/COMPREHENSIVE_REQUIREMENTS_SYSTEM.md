# Z-Beam Generator Comprehensive Requirements System

**VERSION 2.0** | **Single Source of Truth for ALL System Requirements**

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the **Comprehensive Requirements System** - a unified approach to managing ALL generation, validation, and auditing requirements in the Z-Beam Generator. This system consolidates requirements that were previously scattered across 15+ files into a single, authoritative configuration.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
1. **`config/requirements.yaml`** - The **ONLY** place where requirements are defined
2. **`utils/requirements_loader.py`** - Centralized access interface with comprehensive methods
3. **Enhanced MaterialAuditor** - Uses requirements system for all validations
4. **System Integration** - All components reference the single source of truth

### Key Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: All requirements in one file
- **No Hardcoded Requirements**: Zero tolerance for scattered requirement definitions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of system operation covered
- **Fail-Fast Architecture**: Critical violations stop system immediately
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing convenience functions preserved

## 📋 Requirements Categories

### 1. Data Architecture Requirements
```yaml
data_architecture:
  materials_yaml:           # Single source of truth for material data
  categories_yaml:          # Single source of truth for category ranges
  frontmatter_files:       # OUTPUT ONLY - never for data persistence
```

**Key Rules:**
- Materials.yaml: NO min/max ranges (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- Categories.yaml: ALL ranges and category definitions
- Frontmatter: Generated output only, never read for data

### 2. Schema Compliance Requirements  
```yaml
schema_compliance:
  validation_hierarchy:     # Primary, fallback, emergency schemas
  required_root_fields:     # Mandatory vs optional frontmatter fields
  category_enum:           # Valid material categories
  subcategory_enum:        # Valid subcategories by category
  validation_modes:        # Basic, enhanced, research modes
```

**Coverage:**
- 10 material categories with subcategories
- 3 validation modes with specific requirements
- Hierarchical schema fallback system

### 3. Property Validation Requirements
```yaml
property_validation:
  category_requirements:    # Essential properties by category
  property_structure:       # Required/optional fields per property
  confidence_requirements:  # Scoring thresholds by source type
```

**Category Coverage:**
- Metal: 5 essential properties, 50% minimum coverage
- Ceramic: 5 essential properties, 50% minimum coverage  
- Plastic: 4 essential properties, 50% minimum coverage
- Glass, Wood, Stone, Composite, Semiconductor: Category-specific requirements

### 4. Text Quality Requirements
```yaml
text_quality:
  line_formatting:         # Max line length, hard break requirements
  formatting_rules:        # No markdown, proper capitalization
  prohibited_patterns:     # Markdown, placeholders, quality indicators
  quality_thresholds:      # Winston AI scores, believability targets
  text_length:            # Minimum lengths by text type
```

**Quality Gates:**
- 120 character max line length
- No markdown artifacts (**, *, `, #, [], etc.)
- No placeholder text (TODO, TBD, etc.)
- Human believability ≥70%

### 5. Author Voice Requirements
```yaml
author_voice:
  countries:              # Taiwan, Germany, United States, Japan
    vocabulary_indicators: # Primary and secondary vocabulary
    sentence_patterns:     # Country-specific sentence structures
    validation_thresholds: # Minimum indicators, strength thresholds
```

**Cultural Authenticity:**
- 4 country-specific author personas
- Primary and secondary vocabulary indicators
- Minimum 2 indicators per text, 30% strength threshold
- Cultural authenticity minimum 75%

### 6. Frontmatter Structure Requirements
```yaml
frontmatter_structure:
  required_fields:         # Core, properties, content, metadata sections
  optional_fields:         # Recommended but not required fields
  applications:           # Format: \"Industry: Description\", minimum 2
  tags:                   # 4-10 tags covering categories/industries
  author:                 # ID, name, country, expertise structure
```

### 7. Validation Severity & Audit Reporting
```yaml
validation_severity:
  critical:               # Architectural violations (fail-fast)
  high:                   # Major requirement violations
  medium:                 # Best practice violations
  low:                    # Style/optimization suggestions
  info:                   # Informational findings

audit_reporting:
  terminal_report:        # Terminal report configuration
  icons:                  # Visual indicators for different categories
  file_reports:          # File-based report generation
```

### 8. Fail-Fast Enforcement Rules
```yaml
fail_fast:
  zero_tolerance:         # Production mocks, architectural violations
  pre_execution_checks:   # System requirements, configuration validation
  runtime_validation:     # Property structure, content quality
  error_handling:         # Required practices and exception types
```

### 9. Testing & Quality Assurance Requirements
```yaml
testing_requirements:
  coverage_requirements:  # Unit, integration, validation test coverage
  test_data:             # Materials coverage, property coverage
  quality_gates:         # Pre-commit, pre-merge, pre-release gates
  performance_benchmarks: # Generation speed, memory usage, API performance
```

### 10. System Integration Requirements
```yaml
system_integration:
  component_requirements: # Frontmatter generator, property manager, etc.
  data_flow:             # Primary flow, validation checkpoints
  api_requirements:      # Deepseek and Winston integration specs
  file_system:           # Directory structure, permissions, validation
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Requirements Access
```python
from utils.requirements_loader import RequirementsLoader

loader = RequirementsLoader()

# Check if field is prohibited in Materials.yaml
is_prohibited = loader.is_prohibited_field_in_materials("min")

# Get essential properties for a category
essential_props = loader.get_essential_properties("metal")

# Get author voice requirements
voice_reqs = loader.get_author_voice_requirements("taiwan")
```

### Comprehensive Validation
```python
# Get complete property validation for category
validation_config = get_property_validation_for_category("ceramic")

# Validate property structure
errors = validate_property_structure(property_data)

# Get comprehensive validation config for system
config = get_comprehensive_validation_config()
```

### Audit Integration
```python
# MaterialAuditor automatically uses comprehensive requirements
auditor = MaterialAuditor()
result = auditor.audit_material("aluminum")

# Terminal reports use configured icons and thresholds
# auditor._print_terminal_audit_report(result)
```
