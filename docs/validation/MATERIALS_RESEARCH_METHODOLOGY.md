from data.materials import load_materials
import json

data = load_materials()
report = {
    'total_materials': len(data['material_index']),
    'categories': {},
    'missing_fields': {},
    'field_coverage': {}
}

for category, cat_data in data['materials'].items():
    items = cat_data['items']
    report['categories'][category] = len(items)
    
    # Track field coverage
    all_fields = ['name', 'symbol', 'formula', 'author_id', 'complexity', 
                  'difficulty_score', 'applications', 'industry_tags']
    
    for field in all_fields:
        if field not in report['field_coverage']:
            report['field_coverage'][field] = 0
        
        for item in items:
            if field in item:
                report['field_coverage'][field] += 1

print(json.dumps(report, indent=2))
" > materials_coverage_report.json
```

Aluminum,Al,Al,Al,Al,https://nist.gov/...,Verified,Keep current
Iron,Fe,Fe,Fe,Fe,https://nist.gov/...,Verified,Keep current
Stainless Steel,SS,Fe-Cr-Ni,N/A,Fe-Cr-Ni,https://asm.org/...,SS is industry standard,Keep current
```

### Phase 3: Laser Parameter Validation (Week 3)

- [ ] Repetition rate optimized for cleaning efficiency

**Research Template**:
```yaml
