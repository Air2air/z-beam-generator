# Material Data Structure Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the material data handling system to ensure consistent access to materials data throughout the application.

## Problem Statements

1. **Inconsistent Material Data Access**: Different parts of the code were accessing the materials data structure in inconsistent ways, leading to errors like "Material 'Steel' not found" in tests despite the material existing in the data.

2. **Mock vs. Real Data**: The test environment was using mock material data instead of the real `materials.yaml` file, causing discrepancies between test and production environments.

3. **Batch Generation Failure**: The batch generation mode (`--all` flag) was not finding any materials because it wasn't correctly accessing the "materials" key in the data structure.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Consistent Data Structure

- Modified `load_materials()` in `data/materials.py` to return the complete data structure with the "materials" key, ensuring consistent data access patterns.
- Updated `DynamicGenerator.get_available_materials()` to properly handle the nested data structure.

### 2. Unified Data Source

- Removed mock materials data in test files, ensuring all tests use the real `materials.yaml` file.
- Updated `TestDataFactory` to use the real materials data instead of creating mock data.
- This ensures that tests accurately reflect production behavior with real data.

### 3. Batch Generation Fixes

- Fixed batch generation in `run.py` to properly access the "materials" key in the data structure.
- Updated code in both standard batch mode (`--all`) and content batch mode (`--content-batch`) to correctly navigate the data structure.

## Implementation Details

### Changes to `data/materials.py`

```python
def load_materials():
    """Load materials data from YAML file."""
    materials_file = Path(__file__).parent / "materials.yaml"

    try:
        with open(materials_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            data = yaml.safe_load(f)
        
        # Return the complete structure, not just the materials section
        # This makes it compatible with both DynamicGenerator and other components
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading materials data: {e}")
        return {"materials": {}}  # Return an empty but valid structure
```

### Changes to `run.py` (Batch Generation)

```python
# Load materials data
from data.materials import load_materials

materials_data = load_materials()

# Access the "materials" key to get the actual materials data
if "materials" not in materials_data:
    print("‚ùå Error: No 'materials' key found in materials data")
    return
    
materials_section = materials_data["materials"]

# Count total materials across all categories
total_materials = sum(
    len(category_data.get("items", []))
    for category_data in materials_section.values()
)

categories = list(materials_section.keys())
```

### Changes to `tests/test_framework.py`

Updated `TestDataFactory.create_test_materials` to use the real materials data from `materials.yaml` instead of creating mock data.

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All parts of the system now access material data in a consistent way.
2. **Reliability**: Tests now use the same data source as production code, eliminating discrepancies.
3. **Maintainability**: Code is more maintainable with a single source of truth for material data.
4. **Fail-Fast Architecture**: The system will fail immediately if the materials data structure is invalid, rather than silently using incorrect data.

## Testing

All tests have been updated and verified to work with the new data structure. The batch generation has been tested with both the `--all` flag and the `--content-batch` flag, confirming that it correctly finds and processes materials.
