# Deprecated Documentation Archive

**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Archive outdated documentation superseded by system improvements

## Why These Documents Are Deprecated

This directory contains documentation that is **no longer accurate** or has been **superseded by newer, better documentation**. These files are preserved for historical reference but should **NOT** be used for current system understanding or operations.

---

## Deprecation Categories

### 1. Pre-Flattening Structure Docs

**Reason**: System migrated from nested to flat `materials.yaml` structure on October 2, 2025

**Superseded By**: `docs/architecture/DATA_STRUCTURE.md`

**Files**:
- Files describing nested structure access patterns
- Old material lookup examples
- Nested data structure guides

**What Changed**:
```yaml
# OLD (nested structure)
materials:
  metal:
    items:
      - name: Aluminum
        properties: {...}

# NEW (flat structure)
materials:
  Aluminum:
    category: metal
    properties: {...}
```

### 2. Old Validation Rules

**Reason**: Validation rules changed to accept simple string applications and camelCase captions

**Superseded By**: `docs/operations/VALIDATION.md`

**What Changed**:
- Applications: Structured objects → Simple strings
- Caption: snake_case → camelCase
- Tags: Optional → Required (4-10 items)

### 3. Completed Implementation Proposals

**Reason**: Proposals have been fully implemented and are now documented in architecture docs

**Superseded By**: Various architecture and operation guides

**Files**:
- Implementation proposals that are now complete
- Design documents for features that exist
- Planning docs for completed work

---

## Archived Files

### HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md

**Deprecated**: October 2, 2025

**Superseded By**: `docs/architecture/DATA_STRUCTURE.md`

**Historical Context**: 
- Documented the nested materials structure
- Explained two-step material lookups
- Described category-based organization

**Why Outdated**:
- System now uses flat structure (direct O(1) lookups)
- Category embedded in each material
- Simpler access patterns

---

### MATERIAL_DATA_STRUCTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md

**Deprecated**: October 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Improvements have been implemented  
**Superseded By**: `docs/architecture/DATA_STRUCTURE.md`

**Historical Context**:
- Proposed flattening materials.yaml
- Suggested performance improvements
- Outlined migration strategy

**Why Outdated**:
- All proposed improvements implemented

**Superseded By**: `docs/SYSTEM_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`

**Historical Context**:
- Identified unused code (unified_generator.py)
- Proposed deletion of 509 lines
- Outlined simplification strategy

**Why Outdated**:
- unified_generator.py deleted (Sept 30, 2025)
- Streamlined generator is sole implementation
- System simplified as proposed

---

### PIPELINE_STATUS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

**Deprecated**: October 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Status information outdated  
**Superseded By**: `docs/SYSTEM_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`

**Historical Context**:

- Listed recommendations for improvement
- Documented known issues

**Why Outdated**:
- Status has changed significantly
- Recommendations have been implemented
- New assessment provides current status

---

### CAPTION_FIELD_ORGANIZATION_PROPOSAL.md

**Deprecated**: October 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Proposal implemented, now standard  
**Superseded By**: `docs/operations/VALIDATION.md` (caption section)

**Historical Context**:
- Proposed camelCase for caption keys
- Suggested full caption structure
- Outlined migration from snake_case

**Why Outdated**:
- Proposal fully implemented
- camelCase is now standard
- Validation enforces new format

---

### WINSTON_AI_SCORING_CLARIFICATION.md

**Deprecated**: October 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Component-specific, should be in component docs  
**Superseded By**: `docs/operations/VALIDATION.md` (quality scoring section)

**Historical Context**:
- Explained Winston AI scoring dimensions
- Described quality thresholds
- Outlined integration process

**Why Outdated**:
- Information now in VALIDATION.md
- More comprehensive quality documentation exists
- Integrated into broader validation context

---

## How to Use Deprecated Docs

### ❌ DO NOT

1. **Reference for current system**: These docs describe old systems
2. **Follow for implementation**: Procedures are outdated
3. **Use for troubleshooting**: Issues described may not exist anymore
4. **Share with new users**: Will cause confusion

### ✅ DO

1. **Historical reference**: Understand why changes were made
2. **Migration context**: See what system was like before
3. **Decision tracking**: Understand architectural decisions
4. **Lessons learned**: Learn from past approaches

## Document Lifecycle

### When to Archive

A document should be moved to `deprecated/` when:

1. **Information is outdated**: Describes old system state
2. **Superseded by better docs**: New doc covers same topic better
3. **Implementation complete**: Proposal/plan fully implemented
4. **Causes confusion**: Contradicts current documentation

### Archive Process

```bash
# 1. Move file to deprecated/
mv docs/OLD_DOC.md docs/deprecated/

# 2. Update this README with entry explaining why

# 3. Add redirect in old location (optional)
echo "This document has been deprecated. See docs/deprecated/README.md" > docs/OLD_DOC.md

# 4. Update INDEX.md to remove references

# 5. Commit with clear message
git add docs/deprecated/ docs/INDEX.md
git commit -m "Archive deprecated documentation: OLD_DOC.md"
```

---

## Accessing Deprecated Docs

### File Listing

```bash
# List all deprecated docs
ls -la docs/deprecated/*.md

# Search deprecated docs
grep -r "search term" docs/deprecated/
```

### Git History

To see when a doc was deprecated and why:

```bash
# View file history
git log --follow docs/deprecated/FILENAME.md

# View specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

---

## Future Deprecations

Documents likely to be deprecated soon:

### Research Pipeline Docs (docs/architecture/)

**Files**: Various Sept 25-26 dated research pipeline docs  
**Reason**: May be outdated or superseded  
**Action**: Review and either update or archive

### Old Error Handling Docs

**Files**: Various error workflow and pattern docs  
**Reason**: May not match current error handling  
**Action**: Consolidate into VALIDATION.md or archive

---

## Restoration

If a deprecated doc is needed (e.g., for rollback):

```bash
# 1. Review the deprecated doc
cat docs/deprecated/OLD_DOC.md

# 2. If truly needed, restore with clear notes
mv docs/deprecated/OLD_DOC.md docs/OLD_DOC.md

# 3. Add "RESTORED" note at top explaining why
echo "**RESTORED**: $(date) - Reason: [explanation]" | cat - docs/OLD_DOC.md > temp && mv temp docs/OLD_DOC.md

# 4. Update this README to remove from deprecated list
```
