# Case-Insensitive Material Name Search Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement case-insensitive material name searches throughout the Z-Beam Generator system. This change addresses issues where material searches failed due to case mismatches, particularly in E2E tests where errors like "Material 'Steel' not found" occurred.

## Files Modified

### 1. generators/dynamic_generator.py

#### Changes:
- Modified the `generate_component` method to use case-insensitive material name comparison
- Added safety check for existence of the "name" field in material items
- Updated the `generate_multiple` method with the same case-insensitive approach

```python
# Before
if item["name"].lower() == material.lower():
    material_data = item

# After
if "name" in item and item["name"].lower() == material.lower():
    material_data = item
```

### 2. generators/workflow_manager.py

#### Changes:
- Updated the `run_material_generation` method to perform case-insensitive validation of material names

```python
# Before
if material not in available_materials:
    raise ValueError(f"Material '{material}' not found...")

# After
if not any(m.lower() == material.lower() for m in available_materials):
    raise ValueError(f"Material '{material}' not found...")
```

### 3. scripts/remove_material.py

#### Changes:
- Updated the `find_material_in_list` method to use case-insensitive material name comparison
- Added safety check for existence of the "name" field in material items

```python
# Before
if item.lower() == material_name.lower():
    return category, i

# After
if "name" in item and item["name"].lower() == material_name.lower():
    return category, i
```

### 4. optimizer/content_optimization.py

#### Changes:
- Updated the `find_material_data` method to use case-insensitive material name comparison
- Added safety check for existence of the "name" field in material items

```python
# Before
if item["name"].lower().replace(" ", "-") == material_name.lower():
    return item

# After
if "name" in item and item["name"].lower().replace(" ", "-") == material_name.lower():
    return item
```

## Testing

These changes should now allow for case-insensitive material name matching throughout the system, making the material search process more robust against case variations. The E2E tests that previously failed with "Material 'Steel' not found" errors should now pass as long as the material exists in the system regardless of case differences.

## Additional Considerations

The material name comparison is now consistently case-insensitive across the system, improving usability and error resilience. This change maintains the existing material data structure while making the search logic more flexible.
