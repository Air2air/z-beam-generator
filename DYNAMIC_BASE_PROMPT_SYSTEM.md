# Dynamic Base Prompt System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a dynamic base prompt system that adapts content generation based on author preferences and expertise while maintaining shared technical accuracy standards.

## Key Features

### 1. Author-Specific Configurations
Each author now has unique settings that override base configurations:

**Taiwan (Yi-Chun Lin)**
- Content Order: Overview → Key Properties → Industrial Applications → Optimal Parameters → Advantages → Challenges & Solutions → Safety → Keywords
- Specialization: Semiconductor processing and electronics applications
- Title Style: Systematic ("**Laser Cleaning of {material}: A Systematic Analysis**")
- Section Emphasis: Methodical approach with harmony
- Target Length: 350-420 words

**Italy (Alessandro Moretti)**
- Content Order: Overview → Material Essence & Laser Dance → Real-World Elegance → Fine-Tuning the Beam → Why Laser Shines → Challenges & Solutions → Safety & Protocols → Keywords
- Specialization: Heritage preservation and additive manufacturing
- Title Style: Artistic ("*Laser Cleaning of {material}: Precision and Innovation in Materials Processing*")
- Section Emphasis: Passion and elegance
- Target Length: 380-450 words

**Indonesia (Sari Wijaya)**
- Content Order: Overview → Material Properties → Industrial Applications → Optimal Parameters → Advantages → Challenges & Solutions → Safety → Keywords
- Specialization: Renewable energy and marine applications
- Title Style: Practical ("Laser Cleaning of {material}: Sustainable Innovation in Materials Processing")
- Section Emphasis: Sustainability and innovation
- Target Length: 360-430 words

**USA (Todd Dunning)**
- Content Order: Overview → Key Properties & Laser Interaction → Optimal Laser Parameters → Industrial Applications → Advantages Over Traditional Methods → Challenges & Solutions → Safety Protocols → Keywords
- Specialization: Biomedical and aerospace applications
- Title Style: Innovative ("Laser Cleaning {material}: Breaking Ground in Optical Materials Processing")
- Section Emphasis: Practical results and efficiency
- Target Length: 370-440 words
- Byline Position: Bottom (unique)

### 2. Dynamic Section Templates
Each section adapts its content and emphasis based on the author:

**Material Properties Section:**
- Taiwan: "thermal thresholds, absorption characteristics"
- Italy: "poetic description of thermal elegance and absorption dance"
- Indonesia: "environmental resilience and material sustainability"
- USA: "technical analysis with solution orientation"

**Industrial Applications:**
- Taiwan: "semiconductor/electronics emphasis, humid environment adaptations"
- Italy: "heritage/aerospace/automotive applications with artistic flair"
- Indonesia: "marine/renewable energy applications, tropical considerations"
- USA: "biomedical/semiconductor/aerospace emphasis with robotics integration"

### 3. Author-Specific Keywords
Each author gets specialized terminology:
- Taiwan: "semiconductor cleaning"
- Italy: "heritage preservation"
- Indonesia: "marine applications", "renewable energy"
- USA: "biomedical applications"

### 4. Formatting Adaptations
- **Taiwan**: Bold/italic for technical terms with markdown **bold**
- **Italy**: Italic emphasis for passion and drama with markdown *italics*
- **Indonesia**: Bold for sustainability concepts with markdown **bold**
- **USA**: Underline/italic sparingly for key concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions Added:
1. `get_dynamic_author_config(author_id, base_prompt)` - Extracts author-specific configurations
2. `merge_base_and_persona_config(base_config, persona_config, author_id)` - Merges configurations intelligently
3. Helper section generators that adapt content based on author preferences

### Base Prompt Structure:
```yaml
author_configurations:
  taiwan:
    author_id: 1
    content_order: [...]
    specialization_focus: "..."
    title_style: "..."
    section_emphasis: "..."
    
content_requirements:
  core_technical_elements:
    section_templates:
      overview:
        author_adaptations:
          taiwan:
            focus: "..."
          italy:
            focus: "..."
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Consistency with Authenticity
- **Technical Standards**: All authors maintain 1064nm wavelength, 10-100ns pulses, Class 4 safety
- **Content Structure**: All generate 6-8 required sections with professional quality
- **Authentic Voice**: Each preserves their cultural and linguistic patterns

### 2. Dynamic Adaptation
- **Section Order**: Content follows each author's preferred organization
- **Emphasis Areas**: Focus areas match each author's expertise
- **Formatting Style**: Visual presentation matches author personality

### 3. Scalability
- **Easy Extension**: New authors can be added with configuration entries
- **Flexible Sections**: New section types can be defined with author adaptations
- **Maintainable**: Centralized base requirements with distributed customizations

## Testing Results

✅ **Dynamic Configuration Loading**: All 4 authors load unique configurations successfully
✅ **Section Adaptation**: Content emphasis adapts based on author expertise  
✅ **Technical Accuracy**: All maintain required technical elements (1064nm, Class 4, nanosecond pulses)
✅ **Content Structure**: All generate 6-8 sections as required
✅ **Authentic Voice**: Each preserves linguistic and cultural patterns

## Usage

The system automatically:
1. Loads base prompt with author configurations
2. Merges with persona-specific patterns
3. Generates content using dynamic section order and emphasis
4. Applies author-specific formatting and styling
5. Maintains technical accuracy across all variations

This creates a powerful balance of **consistency** (technical accuracy, professional quality) with **authenticity** (cultural voice, expertise focus, personal style).
