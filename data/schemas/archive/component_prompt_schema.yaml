# Component Prompt Schema
# Single source of truth for ALL component generation prompts
# Replaces domains/*/prompts/*.txt files
#
# Core Principle 0 Compliance:
# - ALL text generation uses these prompts
# - NO prompts embedded in code
# - Voice instructions injected via {voice_instruction} placeholder
# - Material/item names via {material_name}, {contaminant_name}, etc.

# PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTION RULES
# {material_name} → Item name from Materials.yaml
# {contaminant_name} → Item name from Contaminants.yaml
# {compound_name} → Item name from Compounds.yaml
# {setting_name} → Item name from Settings.yaml
# {voice_instruction} → Injected from shared/voice/profiles/*.yaml (author-specific)

# WORD COUNT ENFORCEMENT
# Approximate guidance only (LLMs don't count during generation)
# Typical variance: 20-30% over target
# Quality-gated mode: Multiple attempts, select best length match

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
# - Per-material prompt overrides (e.g., materials.micro.overrides.aluminum)
# - Context-specific prompts (e.g., industrial vs artistic applications)
# - Multi-language support
# - Seasonal/trending content variations
