# Section Display Metadata Schema
# Defines standardized metadata for all section types used in content generation
# 
# Schema Purpose:
# - Provides consistent display metadata (icon, order, variant) for UI components
# - Defines word count targets for AI-generated section descriptions
# - Contains generation prompts for dynamic section title/description creation
# - Ensures architectural compliance with Core Principle 0.6 (generate complete data at source)
# 
# Field Definitions:
# - icon: UI icon identifier (string, required)
# - order: Display sequence within group (integer, required)
# - variant: Visual styling (enum: default|warning|danger, required)
# - wordCount: Target word count for generated descriptions (integer, required)
# - description: Human-readable section title (string, required)
# - metadata: Generation guidance for context-specific content (string, required)
# - prompt: Detailed AI generation instructions (string, required)
# 
# Architecture Notes:
# - This schema is referenced ONLY during generation phase
# - Generated metadata is saved directly to source YAML files
# - Export processes read from source data, NOT from this schema
# - Ordering follows logical progression: Identity → Properties → Safety → Operations → Interactions
