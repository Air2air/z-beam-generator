    biodegradability:
      primary: Readily biodegradable
      aerobic: ">90% in 28 days"
      anaerobic: Moderate degradation
      half_life: 1-7 days in water/soil
      notes: Rapid biodegradation in aquatic systems
      
    bioaccumulation:
      potential: Low
      log_kow: 0.43
      bcf: <10
      notes: Does not bioaccumulate significantly
      
    soil_mobility:
      koc: 1.8
      classification: High mobility
      leaching_potential: High
      notes: Can contaminate groundwater if spilled on soil
      
    atmospheric_fate:
      photolysis: Yes - photochemical degradation
      half_life_air: 10-20 hours
      reaction: Reacts with hydroxyl radicals
      ozone_depletion: None
      global_warming: Not significant
      
    persistence:
      water: Non-persistent (<1 week)
      soil: Non-persistent (<1 week)
      sediment: Non-persistent

    regulatory_thresholds:
      reportable_quantity: 1000 lbs (EPA)
      sara_313: Yes - toxic chemical release reporting required
      cercla: Yes - hazardous substance
      
    spill_environmental_impact:
      water_contamination: Moderate - biodegrades quickly
      soil_contamination: Low - volatilizes and biodegrades
      air_quality: Moderate - VOC, contributes to smog formation
      wildlife_impact: Low - rapid dissipation reduces long-term effects
