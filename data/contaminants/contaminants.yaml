        abs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes darker (yellowish-brown to brown), harder, less tacky, and more difficult to remove.
            Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible film (0-24 hours). Tackiness increases as
            solvents evaporate (24-72 hours). Hardening and discoloration begin within weeks. Significant buildup and embrittlement
            occur over months/years, especially with repeated tape applications.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, moderate layer)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue attracting dirt/dust)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, uniform coating (if adhesive was spread), drip marks
            on vertical surfaces, and residue concentrated around edges of the tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - faint residue traces; Light (10-30%) - partial coverage, easily visible; Moderate
            (30-60%) - significant coverage, distinct discoloration; Heavy (60-85%) - almost complete coverage, strong discoloration;
            Extreme (>85%) - thick, layered residue.
          description: Adhesive residue on ABS typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight tackiness
            to a hardened, discolored layer. The color varies based on the adhesive type and aging, often appearing as yellowish
            or brownish stains with irregular coverage patterns.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks from tape removal, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, edge effects
            where adhesive bled out from under the tape, and overall film coverage matching the original tape area.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive bleed-out from the tape. The center area may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action and adhesive flow. Textured
            surfaces provide more surface area for adhesive to adhere to, leading to increased residue buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte, especially
            if it has attracted dust or dirt. The residue's transparency affects how the underlying ABS color is perceived.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, hardened, and sometimes brittle texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly rough surface due to adhesive breakdown and ABS interaction.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, built-up residue),
            but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of pooling or repeated adhesive application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (from dried adhesive),
            and patches (where tape was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (if adhesive was evenly spread) to extremely
            non-uniform with thick and thin patches.
        acrylic (pmma):
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often translucent and pliable. Over time (months/years), it yellows, darkens,
            becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. The adhesive may also harden, making removal more difficult.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited (hours/days). Over weeks, the residue begins
            to oxidize and thicken, becoming more visible. After months/years, it hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake
            off, forming crusts and patches.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 ''Wheat'' (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#E9D6A7 ''Pale Goldenrod'' (moderate aging, common)'
          - '#D2B48C ''Tan'' (significant aging, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a general hazy film. The pattern
            often mirrors the original tape application, leaving distinct outlines or rectangular shapes.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, albeit thin, layer.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application pressure,
            and removal method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged tape application and degradation.
          description: Adhesive residue on acrylic presents as a hazy, often yellowish or brownish film, varying in thickness
            and coverage. It commonly appears as localized spots or streaks, reflecting light differently than the surrounding
            clean acrylic surface, creating a visual contrast. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where tape was applied. Can be uniform within the taped area or exhibit
            variations due to uneven tape pressure or adhesive transfer.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Curved surfaces may exhibit streaking due to adhesive flow.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulations
            at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces exhibit pooling and more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            angled lighting, the residue becomes more visible due to differences in light reflection compared to the clean
            acrylic.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a rough, crusty, or powdery texture as it
            ages and dries. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach several hundred micrometers in areas of
            heavy buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts
            (aged residue), and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven deposits.
        alabaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color, and less tacky, often developing a hardened or cracked surface. Oxidation and dust accumulation
            contribute to the darkening and increased visibility.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time: initially a thin, even film (hours), followed by increased tackiness
            and dust accumulation (days), then hardening and discoloration (weeks), and finally crust formation and potential
            cracking (months/years).'
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC (Beige-White, fresh residue)'
          - '#E0C898 (Light Yellow-Brown, slightly aged)'
          - '#C29B6B (Medium Brown, moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 (Saddle Brown, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#A9A9A9 (Dark Gray, dust-embedded residue)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular or linear outlines corresponding to the tape's shape, localized
            spots where adhesive was concentrated, and streaks resulting from tape removal. Drip marks may be present if the
            adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at the edges of the tape application area, where adhesive
            may have squeezed out. Crevices and surface imperfections can also trap and concentrate the residue. Flat surfaces
            tend to have a more even distribution within the tape outline.
          coverage_ranges: 'Coverage ranges vary widely: sparse (<10%) for lightly applied tape, light (10-30%) for single-layer
            tape, moderate (30-60%) for overlapping tape, heavy (60-85%) for multiple layers or thick adhesive, and extreme
            (>85%) only in cases of intentional and complete coverage.'
          description: Adhesive residue on alabaster presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent
            to opaque. The residue typically exhibits a yellowish or brownish hue, concentrated in areas where the adhesive
            tape was initially applied, leaving distinct outlines and patterns. Coverage varies from sparse to heavy, depending
            on the tape type and duration of contact.
          distribution_patterns: Distribution patterns are highly dependent on the tape application. Expect rectangular outlines,
            spotty residue, and streaks where tape was removed.
          edge_center_behavior: Residue often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and potential for greater contact
            pressure. The center may have a more uniform, thinner layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in recessed
            areas, corners, and along edges. Convex surfaces may exhibit thinner or more uneven coverage.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the pattern when liquid or semi-liquid adhesives are used, resulting in downward
            flow, pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces, and vertical streaking. Solid adhesives are less affected by
            gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to
            be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. The presence of embedded dust further reduces reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, the residue transitions to a more rigid, sometimes brittle
            or crusty texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure, often incorporating
            dust and debris. Surface can be smooth or rough depending on the tape used.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue layer typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the
            type of adhesive and the application method. Thicker accumulations may reach up to 100 micrometers in localized
            areas.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was
            used), and crusts (in heavily aged areas). The residue may also form a raised edge along the perimeter of the
            tape application area.
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is highly variable. Residue can be perfectly uniform within the area covered by
            the tape, but highly variable across the entire alabaster surface.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Over months/years, it hardens, darkens, and may crack
            or flake off. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition is rapid (within minutes/hours of tape application). Over days, the residue
            may spread slightly. Over months/years, it hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake off, with oxidation accelerating
            the process.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#EEDC82 light goldenrod yellow (moderately aged)'
          - '#DAA520 goldenrod (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if
            adhesive was liquid, and uniform coatings where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often occur at edges of the original tape, in corners, and within
            surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type and duration of tape application.
          description: Adhesive residue on alumina presents as a thin, often translucent or yellowish film, sometimes with
            iridescent patches. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape
            application. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform coatings, edge concentrations, and drip patterns are common.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application, but can also be uniform
            across the center if the tape was fully adhered.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and curvature significantly influence distribution. Residue tends to accumulate
            in valleys and along edges. Concave surfaces may exhibit pooling.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward flow and streaking, especially with liquid adhesives. Horizontal
            surfaces may exhibit pooling and more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue becomes matte or exhibits iridescence
            due to surface cracking and oxidation. Angle of incidence affects visibility.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly elastic, transitioning to a brittle, sometimes powdery or crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of concentrated
            buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in surface depressions, crusts around edges,
            and patches corresponding to tape contact areas.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven
            deposits.
        aluminosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or even black, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial adhesion (minutes/hours) results in a thin, uniform film. Over days/weeks, solvent
            evaporation leads to increased viscosity and potential for drip marks. Months/years result in hardening, discoloration,
            cracking, and increased adhesion to the glass surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F5DEB3 wheat (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged)'
          - '#654321 chocolate (extremely aged/burnt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and irregular film coatings are common. Drip marks may be present on
            vertical surfaces. Fingerprints or other surface contact patterns can be imprinted within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and within surface imperfections. Lighter concentration
            on flat, smooth surfaces. Crevices and scratches act as accumulation points.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) is most common. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the adhesive
            was applied very liberally.
          description: Adhesive residue on aluminosilicate glass typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight
            yellow or brown tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. Aged residue can darken and become more brittle,
            showing distinct edges and potential cracking. The residue tends to accumulate more at edges and corners due to
            surface tension effects.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, irregular film coatings, edge accumulation, corner accumulation,
            fingerprint patterns.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Center distribution
            is less common unless the adhesive was initially applied uniformly.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Edges and corners promote accumulation
            due to surface tension. Scratches and imperfections act as reservoirs.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage or pooling in low spots.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, the residue's texture and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hard film. Over time, it can become
            brittle and develop a slightly rough, cracked surface. Microscopic examination may reveal a crystalline or amorphous
            structure depending on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (aged
            residue), patches (irregular coverage).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent and pliable. Over time (months/years), it yellows, darkens,
            hardens, and may crack or flake. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initially a thin, even layer (hours/days). Over weeks, dust and contaminants embed, increasing
            thickness and discoloration. Months/years lead to hardening, cracking, and flaking, with localized buildup in
            crevices.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin residue)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#B8860B ''Dark Goldenrod'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 ''Dim Gray'' (residue with embedded dirt/particulates)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from wiping or peeling, and drip
            marks if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. Fingerprints and other surface contaminants are often embedded
            within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Higher concentrations often found at the edges of the original tape application, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even distribution.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the tape type, application method, and removal process.
            Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on aluminum presents as a patchy, often iridescent film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. Coverage varies significantly, ranging from sparse speckles to near-complete coatings, influenced by the
            original tape's adhesive type and removal method. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, uneven, often mirroring the original tape pattern. Can also appear as a thin, almost
            invisible film across the entire surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas and along edges due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Sharp corners may exhibit thicker buildup.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward flow patterns and streaking, especially with liquid or semi-liquid
            adhesives. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence, particularly under oblique lighting.
            Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Embedded particles can scatter light, creating
            a hazy appearance.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a brittle, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness depending on
            the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened residue, crusts along
            edges, and isolated patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare, usually from spray adhesives) to extremely
            non-uniform (typical of tape residue).
        aluminum bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and highly adhesive. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to brown or even black, becomes less adhesive, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation of
            the aluminum bronze underneath the residue can also contribute to color changes.
          buildup_progression: Initial application results in a thin, uniform film. Over time (days/weeks), dust and debris
            accumulate on the sticky surface. With further aging (months/years), the adhesive degrades, darkens, and may crack
            or flake off, leading to a non-uniform, patchy appearance. Repeated applications exacerbate the buildup.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (carbonized/burnt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid adhesive),
            and a general film-like coating are common. Fingerprints and other contact marks may be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges of the original adhesive application, in corners, and within
            surface crevices. Lighter concentration on flat, exposed surfaces due to wear and cleaning efforts.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the initial application and
            subsequent cleaning efforts. Heavy (>60%) and extreme (>85%) coverage is less common but possible in areas with
            repeated adhesive applications or poor cleaning practices.
          description: Adhesive residue on aluminum bronze presents as a thin, often translucent or slightly opaque film,
            ranging from pale yellow to brownish hues. Coverage varies from sparse spots to more extensive, uneven coatings,
            typically exhibiting a sticky or slightly tacky surface. The residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas and
            along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where the adhesive was
            initially applied. Streaks and lines are common from tape removal. Residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections
            and scratches.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. The center of a flat
            surface typically has less residue due to wear and cleaning.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action
            during application. Recessed areas and grooves act as traps for the adhesive.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow is evident with liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common, especially with aged residue that has partially degraded.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or
            dull. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and variations in thickness become more apparent. Iridescence
            is rare but possible with certain adhesive types and thicknesses.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, the texture transitions to a more brittle and sometimes
            crusty or powdery consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure
            with potential for embedded particulate matter (dust, fibers). Surface roughness increases with aging due to oxidation
            and degradation of the adhesive.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thicker, pooled
            areas). In extreme cases, buildup in crevices can reach up to 200 micrometers or more.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in recessed areas, crusts or flakes
            in aged residue, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, except perhaps with very thin, deliberately applied
            coatings. Typically exhibits significant variations in thickness and concentration across the surface.
        aluminum nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to amber or brown, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. The surface may also attract
            dust and other particulate matter, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initially (hours/days), a thin, clear film is present. Over weeks/months, the residue thickens,
            yellows, and becomes more visible. After years, it can harden, darken, and potentially flake off, leaving behind
            a stained or discolored surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2F0EC translucent off-white (fresh, minimal residue)'
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (slightly aged, thin layer)'
          - '#EEE8AA pale goldenrod (moderate residue, early oxidation)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (aged, thicker layer, potential contamination)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, significant oxidation/degradation)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid), and
            uniform coating (if sprayed or spin-coated). Edge accumulation is common due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform layer, or isolated spots.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application method and the amount
            of adhesive used. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common after tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            from a faint yellowish tint to a more pronounced amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete
            coatings, often exhibiting irregular patterns and edge accumulation. The residue's appearance is influenced by
            the type of adhesive, application method, and environmental exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated along edges, corners, and areas where tape was initially
            applied. Streaks are common from tape removal. Can also appear as isolated droplets or thin films across the AlN
            surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. The center of a flat
            surface may have less residue, especially if the adhesive was applied near the edges.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to increased surface area and capillary
            forces. Surface roughness can also trap residue, leading to localized buildup.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow is evident with liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling at
            the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces may exhibit more uniform coverage or pooling in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under oblique lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte due to surface roughening and oxidation. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain adhesive
            types and thin-film interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the residue is often smooth and slightly sticky. Over time, it can become rough, crusty,
            or even powdery due to oxidation, UV exposure, and the accumulation of airborne contaminants. Microscopic examination
            may reveal crystalline structures depending on the adhesive composition.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (in low-lying areas), thin films (spread across
            the surface), crusts (formed by aged and oxidized residue), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, except in cases where the adhesive was intentionally
            applied as a coating. More often, it's patchy and uneven.
        ash:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hard, brittle, and discolors,
            often exhibiting a cracked or crazed surface. It may also attract dust and dirt, further darkening its appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, relatively uniform film (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation
            causes the film to shrink and concentrate at edges. Months of exposure lead to oxidation, discoloration, and embrittlement.
            Years result in a hard, brittle, and often cracked residue that is difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 ivory (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B773 amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B78E41 dark amber (aged)'
          - '#916B28 brownish-black (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from adhesive transfer during tape removal,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a general film coating where adhesive spread.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges and corners due to surface tension and pooling. Lighter
            concentrations on flat surfaces where the adhesive spreads thinly. Crevices and surface imperfections tend to
            trap and concentrate the residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, application pressure, and removal
            technique. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or prolonged tape application.
          description: Adhesive residue on ash typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a faint yellowish
            tint to a more pronounced amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse, isolated patches to more extensive, streaky
            coatings, often concentrated along edges and corners. The residue tends to darken and become more brittle with
            age.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches corresponding to the original tape footprint, streaky patterns from tape
            removal, edge accumulation due to surface tension, and general film coating across the ash surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and pooling effects. The center of the tape
            footprint may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness increases adhesive contact area, leading to stronger adhesion and more residue
            retention. Edges and corners act as collection points for adhesive due to surface tension.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light. Aged residue tends to become
            matte and less reflective due to surface oxidation and degradation. Under oblique lighting, micro-cracking and
            surface irregularities become more visible.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a smooth, glassy surface as the
            solvent evaporates. Over time, it becomes brittle, hard, and may exhibit micro-cracking. Aged residue can feel
            rough and powdery due to degradation and oxidation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 200 micrometers) occurring
            at edges and corners where adhesive pools.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (formed by drying
            and oxidation), and patches (corresponding to tape contact areas).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular accumulations
            with significant thickness variations.
        bamboo:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and translucent, with a strong adhesive tack. Aged residue becomes brittle,
            darker in color, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. It loses its tackiness and becomes more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape application. Within hours, solvent evaporation
            begins, leading to increased viscosity. Over days, the residue hardens and becomes less tacky. Months to years
            result in oxidation, discoloration, embrittlement, and potential degradation of the adhesive polymer.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderate aging)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (very old, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if
            adhesive was applied in liquid form, and uniform coatings if the entire surface was covered by tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the extent of tape application and removal. Light
            (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on bamboo presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, exhibiting patterns influenced by the original
            tape application and subsequent environmental factors. The residue's color and texture change with age, becoming
            darker and potentially more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Can also spread due to pressure, heat,
            or cleaning attempts. Often concentrated along edges and corners.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Center areas tend
            to have more uniform, thinner coatings.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in grooves,
            indentations, and along edges. Convex surfaces may have thinner coatings due to run-off.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light. Aged residue tends to
            be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, micro-cracks and surface irregularities become
            more visible.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly elastic, transitioning to a smooth, glassy surface as solvents evaporate.
            Over time, it can become rough, brittle, and even powdery, exhibiting micro-cracking and potential crystallization
            depending on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 10 micrometers (thin film) to 200 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Can
            reach up to 1 millimeter in areas of heavy buildup.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (in low-lying areas), thin films (spread across
            the surface), crusts (formed from dried, hardened adhesive), and patches (corresponding to tape contact points).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches
            and streaks.
        basalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent or pale yellow and highly adhesive. Over time (months/years),
            it darkens to tan or goldenrod, becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle or powdery surface. Contamination
            with dust and dirt further darkens the appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited. Over hours/days, the adhesive may flow slightly,
            concentrating along edges. Over weeks/months, oxidation and dust accumulation cause discoloration and thickening.
            Over years, the residue becomes brittle, may crack, and is more difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E6D070 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4A373 tan (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B dark goldenrod (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (contaminated with dust/dirt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a general film
            coating where tape was applied. Often concentrated along the edges of where the tape was.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the size and duration of
            tape application. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless multiple layers of tape were applied or the residue was
            intentionally spread.
          description: Adhesive residue on basalt presents as a patchy, often glossy film, ranging from translucent to a light
            yellow-brown. Coverage varies significantly, with concentrations often found along edges and in crevices. The
            residue's color and texture change over time due to oxidation and environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can spread slightly beyond
            the original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or residue transfer during removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent residue accumulation
            during tape removal. The center area typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness of the basalt influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in valleys
            and depressions, while peaks may have a thinner coating or be relatively unaffected.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom of the affected area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte or have a dull appearance. The presence of micro-cracking can create subtle light scattering.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, sometimes brittle, and occasionally
            powdery texture as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. Can exhibit
            micro-cracking with age.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) in
            areas of pooling or drip marks.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks on vertical surfaces, small pools in depressions, and crust-like formations
            in areas of heavy accumulation. Can also form patchy residues mirroring the original tape pattern.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with significant variations in
            thickness and concentration across the affected area.
        beech:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes harder, more brittle, and darker
            in color due to oxidation and degradation of the adhesive polymers. Cracking and flaking may occur in heavily
            aged areas.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, sticky film (hours). Over days, the adhesive dries and hardens.
            After months, oxidation and degradation lead to darkening and embrittlement. Years of aging can result in cracking,
            flaking, and significant discoloration.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E3D5A5 light beige (slightly aged)'
          - '#C2B280 yellowish-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#A69368 dark tan (heavily aged)'
          - '#8B7355 dark brown (oxidized/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and patches corresponding to the original tape contact points. Streaks and drip
            marks may be present if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state. Outlines of the original tape
            shape are often visible.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically highest at the edges of the original tape application and in
            any crevices or surface imperfections where the adhesive could accumulate. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) for isolated tape marks to light (10-30%) for surfaces with
            multiple tape applications. Moderate (30-60%) and higher coverage are rare unless the entire surface was covered
            with tape.
          description: Adhesive residue on beech presents as a translucent to opaque film, often exhibiting a yellowish-brown
            (#C2B280) discoloration. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate films, influenced by the original tape
            application. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Can also spread slightly beyond the
            tape edges due to adhesive creep or bleed-through.
          edge_center_behavior: Tends to concentrate at the edges of the original tape application, creating a visible outline.
            The center of the tape area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Adhesive tends to accumulate in corners, grooves, and other surface irregularities. Edges and
            raised areas may exhibit thinner coatings due to wiping or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state, gravity will cause downward flow
            and pooling, resulting in vertical streaking and thicker accumulations at the bottom of the application area.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or have a very
            low gloss. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and the outline of the original tape become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hard, and sometimes brittle texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly rough surface due to uneven drying and potential crystallization
            of adhesive components.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) possible
            in areas where the adhesive pooled or was applied heavily.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), and crusts (in heavily
            aged areas). The residue often conforms to the texture of the beech surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Within a single tape mark, the residue may be relatively uniform, but overall
            uniformity across the beech surface is low due to the discrete nature of tape application.
        beryllium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or dark brown, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation of both the adhesive
            and the beryllium surface contributes to the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition (minutes/hours) results in a thin, even film. Over days, the adhesive begins
            to dry and shrink, concentrating at edges and imperfections. Over weeks/months, oxidation and environmental factors
            cause further darkening, embrittlement, and potential flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (residue with particulate contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks corresponding to tape edges, drip marks if applied vertically, and a general
            film-like coating. Fingerprints or other surface contaminants can influence the residue's distribution, creating
            irregular patterns.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and within surface imperfections. Lighter concentrations are observed on flat, smooth surfaces away
            from the tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the tape
            was applied repeatedly or the adhesive was particularly aggressive.
          description: Adhesive residue on beryllium surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate coatings, often concentrated along edges and corners.
            Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the tape footprint and in areas where
            the tape was under greater pressure. Crevices and surface imperfections act as collection points for the adhesive.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the 'edge effect' during tape removal, where adhesive is more likely
            to remain at the perimeter of the tape footprint. The center of the tape area typically has less residue.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action and surface tension
            effects. Concave surfaces may trap adhesive, leading to thicker deposits.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in streaks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom edge of the tape footprint. Pooling may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be matte or slightly reflective, depending on the degree of cracking and surface roughness. The residue can also
            exhibit interference fringes if the layer thickness is comparable to the wavelength of light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy surface upon drying. With
            age and oxidation, the texture becomes brittle, potentially exhibiting micro-cracking and a slightly powdery feel.
            Microscopic examination may reveal a network of fine cracks and a slightly raised topography compared to the bare
            beryllium.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer to 25 micrometers, depending on the type of adhesive and application
            method. Thicker accumulations may occur at edges or in crevices, reaching up to 50 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (around edges
            of thicker deposits), and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting thickness variations
            and localized accumulations.
        birch:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens to yellow-brown or brown, becomes brittle, and is more difficult to remove. Oxidation
            and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over hours/days, tackiness decreases, and dust/debris
            accumulate. Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and embrittlement. Over years, the
            residue becomes hard, brittle, and difficult to remove, often forming a crusty layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (translucent, fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 (pale yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C18F (yellow-brown, moderately aged)'
          - '#B39768 (brown, heavily aged)'
          - '#826A47 (dark brown, oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially placed, streaks from wiping or attempted removal, drip
            marks if liquid adhesive was used, and a general film coating where the adhesive spread.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape placement,
            in corners and crevices, and along the grain of the birch. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application,
            and removal method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with extensive adhesive use.
          description: Adhesive residue on birch presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive type and removal
            method. The residue tends to accumulate in the birch's natural grain and surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, film coatings, edge accumulation, and grain filling are common
            distribution patterns on birch.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and grain lines. The edges of the original tape placement often have a higher
            concentration of residue due to adhesive squeeze-out and incomplete removal.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and in the grain of the birch. Raised areas may have less residue due to abrasion or cleaning.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte or have a dull appearance due to surface degradation and dust accumulation. The sheen is more
            pronounced on thicker deposits.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more brittle and sometimes powdery
            or crusty consistency as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of
            smoothness and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and application method.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick deposits), with an average
            thickness of 10-100 micrometers for typical tape residue.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (where tape was applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thickness and concentration
            varying significantly across the surface.
        bismuth:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes darker (yellow to brown), brittle, less sticky, and more difficult to remove. It
            may also attract dust and other contaminants, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the film may become more uneven
            as volatile components evaporate. After months, the residue hardens, darkens, and attracts dust, forming a crusty
            layer. Years later, the residue can become deeply embedded and extremely difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 (light yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#F5DEB3 (wheat, slightly aged)'
          - '#E9D6A7 (pale goldenrod, moderately aged)'
          - '#D2B48C (tan, heavily aged)'
          - '#A0522D (sienna, residue with embedded particulates)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include outlines of the original tape, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated,
            and streaks or drip marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid form. Fingerprints and other
            handling marks may also be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application, as well as in crevices or surface imperfections. Lighter concentrations are found on flat surfaces
            where the tape made even contact.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges can vary widely, from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the size of
            the tape and the amount of adhesive transferred. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on bismuth surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow
            or brown tint, often concentrated in areas where the tape made direct contact. The residue exhibits a non-uniform
            distribution, following the original tape pattern and leaving behind a sticky or tacky surface. Dominant colors
            are light yellow and off-white.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, following the original tape pattern. Concentrated at edges of the tape, and
            in areas where the tape was under pressure. Can also be found as a thin film across the entire surface that was
            covered by the tape.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to pressure concentration and adhesive squeeze-out. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            corners, and along edges. Raised areas may have less residue due to less direct contact with the tape.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause liquid or semi-liquid adhesive to flow downward, resulting in drip marks and
            pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes even distribution, but can
            also lead to pooling in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss due to its sticky surface.
            Aged residue tends to be more matte, reflecting less light. The presence of embedded particulates can further
            reduce reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, the texture transitions to a more brittle and crusty consistency
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions. Powdery residue may also be present.
          thickness_range: The thickness of adhesive residue typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the type
            of adhesive, application method, and duration of contact. Thicker accumulations may occur at edges or corners.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (if the adhesive was liquid), pools (in depressions),
            crusts (as the adhesive dries and hardens), and patches (where the adhesive was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker accumulations at edges
            and corners and thinner films in the center of the taped area.
        bluestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens, becomes more brittle, and attracts dirt, resulting in a dull, brownish-gray appearance. Oxidation can
            also contribute to color changes.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (hours): Thin, clear film. Days: Slight yellowing, increased tackiness.
            Weeks: Dust accumulation, darkening. Months/Years: Significant discoloration, embrittlement, and potential for
            permanent staining.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#D1BFA0 muted beige-gray (aged, dust-laden)'
          - '#A68B64 brownish-tan (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#736357 dark gray-brown (contaminated with dirt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, linear streaks corresponding to tape edges, drip marks (if adhesive was liquid),
            and overall hazy film.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the taped area, in corners,
            and in crevices on the bluestone surface. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform film.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the tape type, application method,
            and duration of exposure. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the tape was applied very liberally or for an extended
            period.
          description: Adhesive residue on bluestone typically presents as a hazy, translucent film with a slight yellow or
            brown tint, often concentrated in areas where tape edges were located. The residue exhibits varying degrees of
            tackiness and can attract dust and debris, further altering its appearance. Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate,
            depending on the tape type and duration of application.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Linear patterns along tape edges are
            common. Can also spread slightly beyond the original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and tape edge effects. The center of the taped area
            typically has a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities, such as pores and fissures in the bluestone, can trap adhesive and lead
            to localized buildup. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was liquid, gravity will cause it to flow downward, resulting in drip marks and
            pooling at lower points on the surface. Vertical surfaces will exhibit streaking.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue
            tends to be matte due to the accumulation of dust and surface degradation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rougher, tackier surface as it ages and attracts
            particulate matter. May exhibit a slightly crusty texture in areas of thicker accumulation or after exposure to
            moisture.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) at
            tape edges or in areas where adhesive pooled.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), crusts (in areas of thick accumulation), and patches
            of residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker accumulations at edges
            and thinner films in the center of the taped area.
        boron carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and easily smeared, exhibiting a light yellow color. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes hardened, darker in color (brown to dark brown), and more difficult to remove,
            often flaking or cracking.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) involves a thin, even film. Over days, solvent evaporation
            leads to increased viscosity and potential for pooling. Over weeks/months, oxidation and crosslinking cause hardening
            and darkening, leading to crust formation and increased adhesion to the Boron Carbide surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B goldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged)'
          - '#654321 dark brown (extremely aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a general film
            coating. Residue often accumulates in surface imperfections and scratches.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges, in corners, and within surface
            crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more even coatings, unless streaked or spotted.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), with heavy (>60%) coverage only occurring
            in localized areas of extreme accumulation.
          description: Adhesive residue on Boron Carbide typically presents as a thin, uneven film with a dominant yellow-brown
            hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate coatings, often concentrated along edges and corners. Over
            time, the residue darkens and becomes more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: 'Non-uniform distribution is typical. Patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation due to capillary
            action. 2) Streaks from tape removal. 3) Spotty coverage where adhesive contact was inconsistent. 4) Pooling in
            surface depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension effects. Center areas
            tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings or scattered spots.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote residue accumulation due to increased surface area and capillary
            forces. Concave surfaces tend to trap residue more effectively than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte, with
            potential for localized gloss in areas where the residue remains thicker.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery
            texture with age. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures forming within the aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations reaching up to 100 micrometers
            in corners or along edges.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts forming on
            aged residue, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from almost perfectly uniform (rare, only with very thin, carefully

        boron nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue (months/years) becomes brittle,
            hard, and may crack or flake off. Color darkens significantly.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (minutes/hours): Thin, uniform film. Days: Slight thickening, tackiness
            remains. Weeks: Gradual hardening, color change begins. Months: Significant hardening, darkening, potential cracking
            and flaking. Years: Brittle, dark, and difficult to remove.'

          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 ''DimGray'' (residue with particulate contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and uniform thin films
            where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, crevices, and areas where
            tape overlapped. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10%): Isolated spots. Light (10-30%): Scattered streaks and small patches. Moderate (30-60%):
            Partial coverage with visible Boron Nitride. Heavy (60-85%): Near-complete coverage. Extreme (>85%): Complete
            coverage, obscuring the Boron Nitride surface.'
          description: Adhesive residue on Boron Nitride typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow
            or brown tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate coatings, often concentrated along edges or in surface
            imperfections. Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform thin films, edge concentrations, and residue rings around
            previously adhered objects.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and tape application methods. Center
            regions may have thinner, more uniform films.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., scratches, pores) influence residue accumulation. Residue
            tends to collect in valleys and along edges.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of fresh residue. Pooling may
            occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities caused by the residue become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery with age. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or heavy application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly non-uniform distributions
            with distinct spots and streaks.
        borosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is clear or slightly yellow, pliable, and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes darker (yellowish-brown to brown), brittle, less sticky, and may develop a hard, crusty surface.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, even film. Over days, the film thickens and becomes
            more uneven. Over weeks/months, oxidation and dust accumulation lead to discoloration and crust formation. Over
            years, the residue hardens, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 ''DimGray'' (dust-covered, aged)'
          common_patterns: Streaks from tape removal, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, drip marks from adhesive
            flow, and a general film covering the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are found at the edges of the original tape application, in corners
            where adhesive pooled, and in crevices or surface imperfections. Lighter concentrations are typically found in
            the center of the taped area.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots or streaks. Light (10-30%) - thin film with visible glass surface.
            Moderate (30-60%) - partial coating with some areas of bare glass. Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coating with
            thick residue in some areas. Extreme (>85%) - complete coating with thick, opaque residue.
          description: Adhesive residue on borosilicate glass typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight
            yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting streaking
            or pooling patterns. The residue's appearance changes with age, becoming more opaque and potentially developing
            a crusty texture.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where the tape was initially
            applied. Streaks and drip marks indicate the direction of adhesive flow.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent drying. The
            center area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave areas,
            along edges, and around surface features. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced
            reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slightly sticky, transitioning to rough, crusty, or powdery with age and exposure
            to air. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of tackiness.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (sparse film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, pools of hardened adhesive, crusts formed by oxidation and drying, and
            patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (thin, sprayed-on adhesive) to highly non-uniform
            (thick, unevenly applied tape residue).
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and translucent. Aged residue becomes darker, more opaque, and brittle,
            often cracking or flaking. Oxidation of the brass underneath can contribute to a greenish tint around the residue
            edges.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, dust and debris adhere, increasing
            thickness and discoloration. After months, the residue hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake. Years of exposure
            can lead to significant oxidation of the brass underneath the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki - Fresh)'
          - '#DEB887 (BurlyWood - Slightly Aged)'
          - '#CD853F (Peru - Moderately Aged)'
          - '#8B4513 (SaddleBrown - Heavily Aged)'
          - '#696969 (DimGray - Contaminated/Oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, and sometimes
            a more uniform coating where the tape was fully adhered. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often occur at the edges of where the tape was applied, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application, and removal
            method. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) are common.
          description: Adhesive residue on brass presents as a thin, often irregular film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            to amber color. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape application.
            Over time, it darkens and may become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform films, edge concentrations, drip patterns.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and incomplete removal
            during cleaning. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and recessed areas due to capillary action and
            difficulty in complete removal. Sharp edges may exhibit a higher concentration of residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and a thicker accumulation
            at the bottom edge of the tape area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rougher, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with variations in height and debris inclusion.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age), and
            discrete patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches and
            streaks.
        breccia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared, exhibiting a glossy sheen. Aged residue becomes brittle,
            discolors, and may crack or flake off, losing its tackiness.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive flows and pools
            in low areas. After weeks/months, the residue begins to dry, harden, and discolor. Years later, it becomes brittle,
            cracked, and may partially detach from the surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged)'
          - '#654321 dark brown (oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and pooling in depressions
            are common. Residue often mimics the shape of the original tape or adhesive application.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in crevices, corners, and along the edges of
            clasts. Flat, exposed surfaces tend to have lighter, more diffuse coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) in most cases. Heavy (>60%) to extreme
            (>85%) coverage is rare and usually indicates excessive adhesive use.
          description: Adhesive residue on breccia surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from
            pale yellow to brownish hues, often concentrated in crevices and along edges. Coverage varies from sparse speckles
            to moderate coatings, depending on the adhesive type and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Distribution is highly variable, influenced by the breccia's surface roughness and porosity.
            Residue tends to accumulate in low-lying areas and along edges of clasts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. Centers of flat surfaces
            tend to have less residue unless the adhesive was applied uniformly.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry dictates residue accumulation. Concave surfaces trap more residue than convex
            surfaces. Rough textures provide more surface area for adhesion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte
            and may exhibit iridescence due to surface cracking and degradation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery texture as it
            ages and degrades. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures depending on the adhesive composition.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 5 micrometers (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick pools or crusts), depending
            on the adhesive type and application.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical faces, pools in depressions, thin films on flat surfaces, and crusts
            around the edges of adhesive application areas are typical formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly localized and
            uneven deposits.
        brick:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly off-white, pliable, and highly adhesive.
            Aged residue (months/years) yellows, hardens, becomes brittle, and loses its tackiness, often cracking or flaking
            off in small pieces. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited. Over hours/days, the adhesive may flow slightly
            due to gravity or temperature changes. Over weeks/months, the adhesive hardens and begins to yellow. Over years,
            the adhesive becomes brittle, cracks, and may partially detach from the brick surface, leaving behind a discolored
            stain.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC (Beige - Fresh Residue)'
          - '#FFF0F5 (LavenderBlush - Translucent)'
          - '#FFF8DC (Cornsilk - Slightly Aged)'
          - '#E6D8B9 (Khaki - Moderately Aged)'
          - '#C0995F (Sand - Heavily Aged/Oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, linear streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            from adhesive flow, and distinct rectangular or geometric outlines mirroring the original tape shape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices and mortar joints, and in areas where adhesive pooling occurred. Lighter concentrations are found
            on flat brick surfaces away from the tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (60-85%) coverage can occur in areas
            where tape was heavily applied or poorly removed. Extreme (>85%) coverage is rare, usually only occurring in cases
            of intentional adhesive application.
          description: Adhesive residue on brick presents as a patchy, often glossy or matte film, ranging in color from translucent
            off-white to yellowed or brownish hues. Coverage varies significantly, leaving behind distinct outlines or smears
            where tape was previously adhered, often concentrated in mortar joints and brick surface irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: Concentrated at points of tape contact, along tape edges, and in mortar joints. Can also
            be found smeared across the brick surface due to tape removal or adhesive flow.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and residue left behind
            during tape removal. The center area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities, such as brick texture and mortar joints, influence adhesive distribution,
            leading to preferential accumulation in depressions and along edges. Rough surfaces increase the surface area
            for adhesion, resulting in more tenacious residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common, especially with freshly applied adhesive.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light more intensely. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or have a dull sheen, with increased light scattering due to surface roughness and degradation. Some
            residues may exhibit iridescence due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film or a brittle, crusty layer
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly porous or crystalline structure in aged residues. Some
            residues may exhibit a powdery surface due to degradation.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas
            of concentrated buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, pools (especially on uneven surfaces), crusts (in aged residues), and
            distinct patches mirroring the shape of the original tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches and
            streaks.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and pliable. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to amber or brown, becomes brittle, and may exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation, such as cracking
            or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), the adhesive may migrate
            and pool, leading to thicker accumulations in certain areas. With prolonged exposure (months/years), the residue
            hardens, darkens, and may develop a crusty or powdery surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3C16F dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#CDAD61 olive drab (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Streaks, localized spots, irregular patches, outlines of the original tape, drip marks (if applied
            vertically), and accumulation in surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices, and in areas where the adhesive has pooled. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the original tape application and subsequent cleaning
            efforts. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in cases of extensive tape use and minimal cleaning.
          description: Adhesive residue on bronze typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a light
            yellow to a dark amber color. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting a
            streaky or patchy distribution. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, outlines of the original tape, accumulation in crevices and along
            edges, and drip marks (if applied vertically).
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive bleed and residue accumulation along the tape's perimeter. The
            center area may have less residue if the tape was removed cleanly.
          geometry_effects: Adhesive tends to accumulate in concave areas and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Raised areas may have less residue due to easier removal or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and thicker accumulations at the bottom. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes pooling and even distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or dull.
            Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and variations in thickness become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes brittle,
            and often powdery or crusty surface as it ages. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface with
            small ridges or bumps where the adhesive has pooled.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or heavy application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools in depressions, crusts (especially with
            aged residue), and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven deposits.
        calcite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or gray, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited upon tape application. Over hours/days, the adhesive
            may spread slightly. Over weeks/months, oxidation and dust accumulation lead to discoloration and increased thickness,
            particularly at edges. Over years, the residue becomes brittle, cracks, and may partially detach from the calcite
            surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 (Light Yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki, slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 (BurlyWood, moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#696969 (DimGray, residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially adhered, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks if
            cleaning solvents were used. Residue often accumulates along edges and in surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners and crevices, and along surface scratches. Flat surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in areas with minimal tape contact to heavy (60-85%) or extreme
            (>85%) in areas where tape was heavily applied or residue was allowed to accumulate.
          description: Adhesive residue on calcite presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint, distributed unevenly across the surface. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced
            by the original tape application and subsequent environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: Patches corresponding to tape contact areas, streaks from removal, edge accumulation, and
            pooling in surface depressions.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to spread
            outwards from the initial contact point. The center of the tape area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and curvature significantly influence residue distribution. Residue tends to
            accumulate in valleys and along edges, while raised areas may have thinner coatings.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward flow patterns, resulting in streaks and pooling at the bottom.
            Horizontal surfaces may show more uniform distribution or pooling in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Embedded particulate matter can scatter light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes powdery
            or crusty feel with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with potential
            for embedded dust or fibers.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the type of adhesive and application method.
            Thicker accumulations may reach up to 100 micrometers in localized areas.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if solvents were used), pools in surface depressions, crusts formed
            by drying and oxidation, and patches corresponding to the original tape footprint.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven deposits.
        carbon fiber reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent and pliable. Over time (weeks to months), it yellows, hardens,
            and becomes more brittle. Aged residue may crack or flake, especially under stress or temperature changes. Oxidation
            and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition occurs immediately upon tape removal. Within hours, the residue begins to
            spread slightly due to surface tension. Over days, solvent evaporation leads to increased viscosity and tackiness.
            Over weeks to months, oxidation, UV exposure, and environmental contamination cause hardening, discoloration,
            and embrittlement.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale goldenrod (fresh)'
          - '#E6D774 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4A373 tan (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#654321 chocolate (contaminated with dirt/debris)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the tape direction, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and
            uniform coating where the tape was fully adhered. Residue often highlights the weave pattern of the carbon fiber.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges of the original tape application, in corners and crevices,
            and within the weave pattern of the CFRP. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless multiple
            layers of tape were applied and removed repeatedly.
          description: Adhesive residue on CFRP typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a slight yellow
            or brown tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the initial tape application
            and removal process. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and weave patterns.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common, with concentrations along edges, corners, and within
            the weave pattern of the carbon fiber. Areas directly under the tape adhesive tend to have the highest concentration.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners of the original tape application area. The center of the taped area
            typically has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas (corners, crevices) and is less prevalent on convex surfaces. The weave pattern of the carbon fiber acts
            as a micro-scale geometry, trapping residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light more readily. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and residue thickness
            variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more rubbery or crusty texture with age.
            Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness, depending
            on the adhesive type and environmental conditions. Some residues may exhibit a powdery or crystalline appearance
            upon drying.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations in corners and
            crevices. The average thickness is often between 5 and 20 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly perfectly uniform thin films to highly localized and
            concentrated deposits.
        cast iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or pale yellow and tacky. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens
            to a brownish-orange hue, hardens, and may become brittle or powdery. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate this
            process. Very old residue can become almost black and extremely difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, tacky film (hours). Within days, the adhesive begins to
            harden and lose tackiness. Over weeks to months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and embrittlement.
            After years, the residue can become a hard, dark, and difficult-to-remove crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD (Lemon Chiffon - Fresh residue)'
          - '#F5DEB3 (Wheat - Slightly aged)'
          - '#E9C46A (Goldenrod - Moderately aged)'
          - '#D4A373 (Tan - Aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna - Heavily aged, potentially contaminated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, uniform coating
            where tape covered the entire surface, drip marks if adhesive was applied in liquid form, and halo effects around
            the edges of the original tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations typically occur at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating. Areas subjected to pressure
            during tape application may also exhibit higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application. Light (10-30%) and moderate
            (30-60%) coverage are most common in typical tape residue scenarios.
          description: Adhesive residue on cast iron typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in color
            from pale yellow to brownish-orange. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a near-continuous coating, often concentrated
            in areas where the adhesive tape was initially applied. The residue can exhibit a slightly tacky or hardened texture
            depending on age and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches where tape was applied, edge effects where adhesive seeped out from under
            the tape, and overall coverage mirroring the original tape footprint. Can also see distinct patterns from the
            weave of the tape backing.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            a more uniform, thinner coating, or be relatively clean if the tape was not fully adhered in the center.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness of the cast iron influences adhesive distribution. Residue tends to accumulate
            in valleys and crevices. Sharp edges may exhibit thicker accumulations due to surface tension effects.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of liquid adhesive results in vertical streaking and pooling at the bottom of vertical
            surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes uniform spreading, but can also lead to pooling in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and hardens, the surface becomes
            more matte. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and the original tape pattern become more visible.
            Contamination can alter the sheen.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly elastic, transitioning to a hardened, sometimes brittle or powdery
            texture with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface with small ridges and valleys corresponding
            to the original tape pattern. Can also be crusty if exposed to contaminants.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the type of adhesive and application method.
            Thicker accumulations may occur at edges or in crevices, potentially reaching up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts formed
            by hardened adhesive and contaminants, and patches corresponding to the original tape footprint.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, usually only with specialized adhesive
            coatings) to highly non-uniform with distinct patches, streaks, and variations in thickness.
        cedar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically more transparent and pliable. Over months and years, it yellows, hardens,
            and becomes more brittle. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to darkening and increased visibility. The residue
            may also attract dust and dirt, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial residue deposition occurs within minutes of tape application. Over the first few hours,
            the adhesive may spread slightly. Within days, the residue begins to harden. Over months and years, oxidation,
            UV exposure, and dust accumulation contribute to darkening, embrittlement, and increased visibility.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (Fresh, translucent)'
          - '#E6D8B0 (Slightly yellowed)'
          - '#D4C18A (Aged, amber)'
          - '#B7945F (Darkened, oxidized)'
          - '#A37A44 (Residue mixed with cedar oil)'
          common_patterns: Rectangular outlines, linear streaks, and localized spots corresponding to the original tape application.
            Often exhibits a 'ghosting' effect where the adhesive has partially penetrated the cedar grain.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape marks, in corners,
            and in crevices within the cedar grain. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape used and
            the duration of application. Heavy coverage (>60%) is rare unless multiple layers of tape were applied or the
            adhesive was particularly aggressive.
          description: Adhesive residue on cedar presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a slight yellow or brown
            tint, distributed unevenly across the surface. The residue typically follows the pattern of the original tape,
            leaving distinct rectangular or linear marks with varying degrees of coverage and color intensity. The color is
            often influenced by the type of adhesive and the cedar's natural oils.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Can also spread slightly beyond the
            original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or capillary action within the cedar grain.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center of the taped
            area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners and along edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            On curved surfaces, the distribution may be more uneven, with thicker accumulations on the concave side.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, adhesive residue can exhibit downward flow, resulting in vertical streaking
            or drip marks. Pooling may occur at the bottom of the affected area.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and uneven distribution become more apparent. The color shift due to oxidation
            is also more pronounced under different lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film over time. May exhibit
            a slight crusty or powdery texture in areas of thicker accumulation, especially after prolonged exposure to UV
            light and oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) at
            the edges of the original tape application or in areas where adhesive has pooled.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), small pools in depressions, and crusty patches
            in areas of high accumulation. The residue often conforms to the texture of the cedar surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting variations in thickness,
            color, and texture across the affected area.
        cement:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically more pliable and translucent, with a stronger adhesive
            tack. Aged residue (months/years) becomes more brittle, opaque, and discolored, often darkening and attracting
            more dirt and grime. It may also exhibit cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially (hours/days), a thin, tacky film is present. Over weeks, dust and debris accumulate,
            increasing opacity. After months/years, the residue hardens, discolors, and may crack or flake, becoming more
            difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC beige'
          - '#E3DAC9 light-tan'
          - '#D2B48C tan'
          - '#C04000 dark-brown (aged)'
          - '#A0785A medium-brown (dust-embedded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, distinct rectangular or linear outlines mirroring
            the tape's shape, and irregular patches where adhesive transfer was uneven. Streaks may occur if the residue was
            smeared during removal.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at the edges of the original tape application, where
            adhesive tends to accumulate. Crevices and surface imperfections can also trap more residue. Flat surfaces tend
            to have a more even, albeit thin, distribution.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) for minimal residue to moderate (30-60%) for significant tape
            marks. Heavy coverage (60-85%) is rare but possible with excessive adhesive transfer. Extreme coverage (>85%)
            is unlikely unless the entire surface was covered in tape.
          description: Adhesive residue on cement presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte film, varying from translucent
            to opaque. The residue typically exhibits a yellowish or brownish hue, concentrated in areas where tape was previously
            adhered, often leaving distinct edge patterns. Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate, depending on the tape
            type and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Can also spread slightly beyond the
            original tape boundaries due to adhesive bleed or smearing during removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential accumulation
            during removal. The center area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Rough surfaces tend to trap more residue
            in their irregularities, while smooth surfaces allow for a more even spread. Edges and corners are prone to higher
            concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of the adhesive during application or removal, resulting in vertical
            streaking or pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with liquid or semi-liquid adhesives.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte, particularly when covered in dust. The gloss level is also dependent on the type of adhesive.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to smooth, rubbery, or even crusty
            and brittle with age and exposure to environmental factors. Dust and debris often adhere to the residue, creating
            a rougher surface.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 micrometer to 50 micrometers, depending on the adhesive type and
            application pressure. Thicker accumulations can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, irregular patches, distinct outlines of the tape, and occasional drip marks if the
            adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid form. Crusts can form with age, especially in areas exposed to
            moisture.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting variations in thickness
            and color across the affected area. Uniformity depends on the evenness of the original tape application and removal
            process.
        ceramic matrix composites cmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Over time (months/years), it darkens to brown
            or even black, becomes brittle, and attracts dust and debris, making it more visible and difficult to remove.
            Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to dry and
            may become slightly tacky. After weeks, oxidation and dust accumulation start to darken the residue. Months/years
            lead to significant discoloration, embrittlement, and increased difficulty in removal.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 Wheat (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, contaminated with dirt)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (residue with embedded carbon fibers from CMC)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks
            if solvent was used during cleaning. Residue often outlines the original shape of the tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners,
            and in crevices or surface irregularities of the CMC. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is rare and usually
            indicates poor cleaning practices. Extreme (>85%) coverage is unlikely unless the entire surface was intentionally
            coated with adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on CMCs typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow or brown
            tint, often concentrated in areas where tape was previously applied. The residue exhibits varying degrees of tackiness
            and can attract particulate matter, leading to a mottled appearance. Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate,
            depending on the tape used and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape application area
            and in surface imperfections of the CMC. Can also be found within the CMC's porous structure if the adhesive penetrated
            the surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the 'picture frame' effect where adhesive accumulates at the perimeter
            of the tape. The center area often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in concave areas and along edges. Sharp corners and edges may exhibit
            thicker buildup due to surface tension effects during application and drying.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces may exhibit downward flow patterns or streaking, especially if the adhesive
            was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue
            tends to be matte due to surface roughness and accumulated contaminants. The presence of embedded particles can
            create localized variations in reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rougher, tackier, and sometimes crusty texture
            as it ages and oxidizes. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with small peaks and valleys where
            adhesive has pooled or dried unevenly. Can also be powdery if the adhesive has degraded significantly.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or heavy application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if solvent was used), pools in surface depressions, crusts formed by
            dried adhesive, and patches where tape was heavily applied or poorly removed.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films to thick, uneven
            patches.
        cerium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to a brownish-orange, becomes less tacky, and may exhibit cracking or flaking due to oxidation and degradation
            of the adhesive polymers.
          buildup_progression: Initially (hours), a thin, even film is present. Within days, tackiness decreases, and the
            film starts to attract dust and debris. Over weeks/months, oxidation and polymerization cause the residue to darken
            and harden. After years, the residue becomes brittle, cracked, and may partially detach from the surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E9D66B dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F sienna (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks corresponding to tape edges, drip marks from adhesive flow, and a general
            film coating are common. Fingerprints and other handling marks may also be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and within crevices. Flat surfaces generally exhibit a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape used, the duration
            of application, and the cleaning methods employed. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common
            after tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on cerium surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in
            color from a pale yellow to a brownish-orange. The residue often exhibits a non-uniform distribution, with thicker
            accumulations along edges and in crevices, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily distributed in patterns mirroring the original tape application, including straight
            lines, rectangular outlines, and circular shapes. Residue also tends to accumulate around surface imperfections
            and edges.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency of adhesive to flow towards
            boundaries. The center of the taped area typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences residue distribution. Edges and corners act as collection
            points, while recessed areas tend to trap more residue than protruding surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of liquid adhesive, leading to downward
            flow and pooling on horizontal surfaces. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to gravitational forces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. As the residue ages and
            becomes more opaque, the gloss diminishes, resulting in a matte appearance. Iridescence is not typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more brittle, sometimes powdery
            or crusty consistency as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees
            of smoothness and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue varies significantly, ranging from sub-micrometer films (0.1-1 μm)
            to thicker accumulations (10-50 μm) in areas of pooling or along tape edges. In extreme cases, buildup can reach
            several hundred micrometers (100-300 μm).
          typical_formations: Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces, while pools of residue may form on horizontal surfaces.
            Thin films are the most prevalent formation, often accompanied by crusts or patches of thicker, hardened adhesive.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant thickness
            and concentration variations across the surface.
        cherry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Over time, it darkens to
            a brownish hue, becomes less tacky, and may crack or flake. Dirt and debris accumulate, further obscuring the
            original color and texture.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs within hours of tape application. Tackiness decreases within days. Color
            changes and hardening occur over weeks to months. Significant dirt accumulation and embrittlement occur over years.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 ''Wheat'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#E9D6A6 ''Pale Goldenrod'' (aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0785A ''Taupe'' (heavily aged, dirt accumulation)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (burnt/heat-affected)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if
            adhesive was applied in liquid form, and uniform coating if the tape was wide and evenly applied.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners or crevices where adhesive could pool, and on flat surfaces where the tape made full contact. Lighter
            concentrations occur in areas of partial tape contact or where the adhesive has been partially removed.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage, depending on the tape type, application
            method, and removal process. Heavy (>60%) to extreme (>85%) coverage is rare, typically only occurring with intentional
            adhesive application.
          description: Adhesive residue on cherry wood presents as a glossy to matte film, often with a slight yellow or brown
            tint, exhibiting varying degrees of tackiness. Coverage ranges from sparse spots to moderate films, influenced
            by the original tape application. Over time, it can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform films, and edge concentrations are common. The pattern
            directly reflects the original tape application and removal method.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Center distribution
            depends on the tape type and application pressure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and around raised features. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to higher
            concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking or pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes even distribution and pooling in
            low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte
            or have a dull appearance due to surface oxidation and dirt accumulation. Iridescence may be observed in very
            thin layers due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and embedded particulate
            matter (dust, fibers).
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (in depressions), films (thin, even layers),
            crusts (thick, hardened layers), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, typically from liquid adhesive application)
            to highly non-uniform (common with tape residue).
        chromium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often nearly invisible, appearing as a slight sheen. Over time (weeks to months),
            it yellows and hardens, becoming more visible and potentially attracting dust and debris. Years of aging can lead
            to oxidation and a brittle, cracked appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible film (hours). Within days, tackiness attracts
            dust. Weeks see yellowing and hardening. Months lead to oxidation and increased visibility. Years result in brittle,
            cracked residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0F8FF (Almost imperceptible, fresh residue)'
          - '#FFFACD (Pale Yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#E6D799 (Light Tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#C2B280 (Dark Tan, heavily aged)'
          - '#8B4513 (Brown, oxidized/heat-affected)'
          common_patterns: Ghosting of the original tape outline, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, streaks
            from wiping or cleaning attempts, and drip marks if the adhesive was applied in liquid form.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentration at the edges of the original tape application, in corners and crevices
            where adhesive may have accumulated, and on flat surfaces where it was directly applied. Lighter concentration
            in areas that were wiped or cleaned.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial tape application and subsequent cleaning
            efforts. Light (10-30%) is common after attempted cleaning.
          description: Adhesive residue on chromium presents as a hazy, often iridescent film with localized areas of concentrated,
            discolored adhesive. The residue typically exhibits a gradient from a translucent sheen to opaque, yellowish-brown
            patches, following the original tape's pattern. Coverage varies significantly depending on the adhesive type and
            removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Ghosting (outline of the tape), Spotting (random small deposits), Streaking (linear marks
            from wiping), Pooling (accumulation in low spots), Edge effects (concentration along tape edges).
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Center areas may
            have a more uniform, thinner layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. On curved surfaces, gravity can cause the adhesive to flow and create drip marks.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes even distribution, but can also lead to pooling
            in low spots.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit iridescence due to thin-film interference. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or have a low gloss, scattering light diffusely. Under oblique lighting, the residue's texture and patterns
            become more pronounced.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with potential for
            a crusty or powdery surface as it ages and oxidizes. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with
            varying degrees of roughness depending on the adhesive type and removal process.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for a thin film, but can reach 50-200 micrometers in areas
            of concentrated buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened adhesive, crusts of
            oxidized adhesive, and patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from nearly perfectly uniform (a very thin, even film) to highly
            non-uniform (thick patches and bare areas).
        cobalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hard, brittle, and prone to cracking
            and flaking. Color darkens significantly due to oxidation and UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to dry and
            thicken, concentrating at edges. After months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and embrittlement.
            Years of exposure lead to significant degradation, cracking, and flaking of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 ''Wheat'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#D2B48C ''Tan'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 ''Dim Gray'' (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if applied in liquid form, and a general
            film covering the surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive application,
            in corners, and within surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the application method and the amount
            of adhesive used. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the entire surface was intentionally coated.
          description: Adhesive residue on cobalt surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow
            or brown tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. Over time, it can darken and become more brittle,
            leading to cracking and flaking. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape application and
            in surface imperfections. Streaks are common from wiping or tape removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension during application and
            drying. The center of a surface typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects during
            application and drying. Recessed areas trap residue and prevent easy removal.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward flow and streaking, especially with liquid adhesives. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to have more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced
            reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin layers due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery with age. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of tackiness.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts formed
            by drying and oxidation, and patches where the adhesive was unevenly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible thin films to thick, localized deposits.
        concrete:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow, pliable, and sticky. Aged residue becomes darker
            (yellow to brown), brittle, and less adhesive, often incorporating dirt and debris.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours/days). Over weeks/months, oxidation and
            dirt accumulation darken the residue and increase its thickness. After years, the residue becomes brittle, cracked,
            and heavily contaminated with environmental debris.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, dirt accumulation)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (extreme aging, potential mold/mildew)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, linear streaks from tape edges, and overall
            rectangular or square outlines mirroring the original tape shape.
          concentration_variations: Higher concentration at the edges of the original tape application, in crevices and surface
            imperfections, and in areas where the tape was under greater pressure.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) for minimal residue to heavy (60-85%) or extreme (>85%) for extensive
            tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on concrete presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, reflecting the original tape pattern. Color
            and texture change significantly with age and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, spotty patterns, edge lines, and ghosting effects where the tape was
            previously located.
          edge_center_behavior: Often more concentrated at the edges of the tape application due to pressure and adhesive
            squeeze-out.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and in any surface irregularities. Rough
            surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, residue may exhibit downward flow patterns and drip marks. Pooling can
            occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue
            tends to be matte due to surface roughness and dirt accumulation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, crusty, or powdery texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with embedded dust and debris.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers for thin films, up to 200 micrometers for thicker, pooled
            areas.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), pools in surface depressions, crusts along edges,
            and patches where the tape was torn or damaged.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        copper:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or orange, becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle, cracked appearance due to oxidation
            and degradation of the adhesive polymers.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progresses rapidly in the first few hours as the adhesive settles and bonds to the
            copper. Over days, oxidation begins, changing the color and texture. Over months and years, the adhesive degrades
            further, becoming brittle and less adhesive, with increased oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, significant oxidation)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (very old, heavily oxidized, degraded adhesive)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines corresponding to the original tape shape, streaks
            from tape removal, and localized spots where adhesive remained after removal. Fingerprints and other handling
            marks are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application area. Crevices and surface imperfections can also trap more residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless
            the tape was extremely sticky or left on for an extended period.
          description: Adhesive residue on copper presents as a discoloration, ranging from a faint, almost imperceptible
            sheen to a noticeable, tacky film. The color varies from a translucent yellow to a brownish-orange, often concentrated
            in areas where the tape was initially applied, leaving distinct patterns. Coverage is typically localized, mirroring
            the original tape's dimensions.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where tape was applied, often with sharp edges defining the tape's original
            boundaries. Streaks and smears are common extending from the main residue area.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and better adhesion at the
            perimeter. The center tends to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            grooves, and around raised features. Sharp edges can create stress points leading to residue buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of fresh adhesive, leading to vertical streaking, especially
            on vertical surfaces. Pooling may occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces or in low-lying areas on horizontal
            surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to
            be matte due to surface roughness and oxidation. The color shift is more pronounced under bright light.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and slightly sticky. Over time, it becomes rougher, potentially
            crusty or powdery due to oxidation and adhesive degradation. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface
            with varying degrees of tackiness.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the type of adhesive and the removal
            process. Thicker deposits can reach up to 100 micrometers in localized areas.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, localized pools of adhesive, and crusty patches, especially
            with aged residue. Drip marks are rare unless the copper surface was vertical during tape application or degradation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker deposits at the edges
            of the tape and thinner layers in the center.
        crown glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellowish and pliable. Aged residue darkens, becomes more
            opaque, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. It also becomes more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition occurs immediately upon tape removal (0-24 hours), resulting in a thin,
            sticky film. Over days to weeks, the residue hardens and oxidizes, becoming less tacky. Over months to years,
            it darkens, embrittles, and may accumulate dust and debris, leading to a more visible and persistent stain.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, newer residue)'
          - '#B8860B ''DarkGoldenrod'' (aged, oxidized residue)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded residue)'
          - '#A9A9A9 ''DarkGray'' (residue with embedded dust/particulates)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, irregular patches, and distinct outlines mirroring the shape of the original
            adhesive tape. Fingerprints and smudges are also common.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners where the tape was
            applied, as well as in areas where the adhesive was thicker or more heavily applied. Lighter concentrations are
            found in the central areas of the tape footprint.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare and usually indicates
            excessive adhesive application or prolonged exposure.
          description: Adhesive residue on crown glass typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown
            tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns and localized concentrations. Over time, it can darken and
            become more brittle, leaving behind a visible stain. The residue often appears as a hazy film with distinct edges
            where the tape was previously adhered.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated along the edges of where the tape was, or in areas where
            pressure was applied during adhesion. Can also be found in streaks where the tape was removed.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent residue deposition
            upon removal. The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and surface imperfections due to capillary action
            and surface tension. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can cause the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and streaks. Pooling may occur at the bottom edge of the tape footprint.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and boundaries become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film. With age and exposure
            to environmental factors, it can become brittle, crusty, and develop a slightly rough surface texture. Microscopic
            examination may reveal a network of fine cracks.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thicker, concentrated areas).
            Heavily built-up areas can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films to highly localized
            and concentrated deposits.
        dolomite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Over time (months/years), it hardens, yellows/browns,
            becomes brittle, and attracts dirt, leading to a darker, more noticeable stain.
          buildup_progression: Initially a thin, even film (hours). Over days, dust and debris adhere, increasing thickness
            and discoloration. Over months, oxidation and degradation lead to hardening, embrittlement, and further discoloration.
            Years result in a thick, crusty, and heavily soiled residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 Wheat (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (dust-embedded, heavily soiled)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if adhesive
            was liquid or softened, and a general film coating across the taped area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices and surface irregularities, and in areas where the tape was torn or damaged. Lighter concentrations
            occur in the central areas of the taped region.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) for incidental contact to heavy (60-85%) or extreme (>85%) for areas
            completely covered by tape.
          description: Adhesive residue on dolomite presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a near-continuous coating, influenced by the original tape application.
            The residue tends to accumulate in surface irregularities and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread slightly beyond
            the original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or smearing during removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and accumulation during
            removal. The center tends to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Adhesive tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and within surface depressions due to capillary
            action and gravity. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          gravity_influence: Causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, leading to drip marks and pooling at the bottom of vertical
            surfaces. Vertical streaking is common during tape removal.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue becomes matte and less reflective
            due to surface degradation and embedded particulates. Iridescence may be observed in very thin layers due to interference
            effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, slightly crusty, and sometimes powdery texture
            as it ages and degrades. Dust and particulate matter become embedded, further roughening the surface.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick accumulation), occasionally
            reaching 100-200 micrometers in areas of heavy buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (uneven removal).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            with distinct edges and varying thicknesses.
        dysprosium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue darkens to brown
            or even black, becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle, crusty texture. Oxidation and environmental contaminants
            contribute to the color change and altered texture.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), dust and contaminants
            accumulate, leading to a darker, more visible residue. After months/years, oxidation and cross-linking of the
            adhesive polymers result in a brittle, crusty texture and further darkening.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (oxidized/contaminated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks
            if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. Fingerprints and other handling marks may also be visible within the
            residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and within any surface crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating. Areas
            subjected to higher pressure during tape application will also have higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application
            method, and removal process. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or improper
            removal techniques.
          description: Adhesive residue on Dysprosium presents as a patchy, translucent film with a slight yellow or brown
            tint. Coverage varies, often concentrated in areas where the tape was initially applied, leaving behind a sticky,
            uneven surface. Over time, oxidation of the adhesive can lead to darkening and increased tackiness.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the original tape contact points and edges. Streaks
            and smears are common due to the removal process. The distribution is heavily influenced by the tape's adhesive
            properties and the force applied during removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesives to concentrate
            at these points. The center of the taped area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and other geometric features due to capillary action
            and surface tension. Rough surfaces will trap more residue than smooth surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces may exhibit downward flow or streaking, especially with fresh or liquid adhesives.
            Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits in localized areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light more readily. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity due to surface oxidation and contamination. Viewing angle significantly
            affects the visibility of the residue.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more crusty and potentially powdery texture
            with age and oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness
            depending on the adhesive type and removal method. Some areas may exhibit a smooth, glossy appearance due to the
            adhesive's inherent properties.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the type of adhesive and the method of
            application/removal. Thicker deposits may occur at edges or where the tape was overlapped.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), and crusts (with aged
            residue). Microscopic examination may reveal the presence of individual adhesive fibers or particles.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from near-uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        ebony:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and translucent. Aged residue (months/years) becomes opaque,
            yellowish or brownish, harder, and more prone to cracking and flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible film. Over hours/days, the solvent evaporates,
            leaving a tacky residue. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens and oxidizes, becoming more visible and difficult
            to remove. Years of buildup can result in a thick, discolored crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC ivory'
          - '#FAF0E6 linen'
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon'
          - '#E3DAC9 light taupe'
          - '#D2B48C tan'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid adhesive),
            and a general film-like coating. Fingerprints are often visible.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and within crevices or surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is rare and usually
            indicates excessive adhesive use.
          description: Adhesive residue on ebony presents as a hazy, often glossy film with a dominant off-white to yellowish
            hue. Coverage varies from sparse speckles to moderate films, often concentrated along edges and corners. Over
            time, it can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread due to
            cleaning attempts, resulting in a thin, uneven film across the surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension during application and
            drying.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Recessed areas and grooves trap residue, making removal more difficult.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity will cause downward flow, resulting in vertical
            streaking and pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces will exhibit more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight gloss or sheen, while aged residue tends to be matte or
            have a dull, chalky appearance. The ebony underneath may appear slightly darker due to light refraction through
            the residue.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film or a brittle, sometimes
            powdery residue with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly crystalline structure in some aged residues.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), small pools in surface depressions, crusts
            around the edges of residue patches, and irregular patches corresponding to the shape of the original adhesive
            material.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly concentrated, uneven
            patches.
        epoxy resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellowish and sticky. Over time, it darkens to brown or
            reddish-brown, becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle or crusty texture. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute
            to color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial adhesion leaves a thin, even layer (hours). Over days, tackiness attracts dust and
            debris, increasing thickness. Weeks/months lead to oxidation and hardening, forming a visible film. Years result
            in significant discoloration, embrittlement, and potential chemical interaction with the epoxy resin.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, minimal aging)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, weeks)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, months)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, years, potential oxidation)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (extreme aging, significant degradation)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from wiping or attempted removal, drip
            marks if solvent was used, and a general film coating across the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application duration, and removal
            method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged tape application and poor removal techniques.
          description: Adhesive residue on epoxy resin composites typically presents as a thin, often translucent or slightly
            opaque film with yellowish or brownish hues. Coverage varies from sparse spots to more extensive coatings, depending
            on the tape type and removal method. The residue often exhibits a slightly sticky or tacky surface.
          distribution_patterns: Localized around the original tape application area, with potential for spreading due to
            cleaning attempts. Often concentrated along edges and corners where tape was initially adhered.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the initial tape adhesion pattern and potential for residue accumulation
            during removal. The center may have a thinner coating or be relatively clean.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in concave areas and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Convex surfaces may have a thinner coating due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces may exhibit downward flow patterns, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces may show more uniform distribution or pooling in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be more matte.
            Under oblique lighting, the residue's uneven surface becomes more apparent, revealing subtle variations in thickness
            and texture.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more crusty or powdery texture with age
            and exposure to environmental factors. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with small ridges
            and valleys. Can also appear smooth if residue is extremely thin.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if solvents were used), small pools in surface imperfections, crusts
            along edges, and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (extremely thin film) to highly non-uniform
            (thick patches and streaks).
        europium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and pliable. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color, more brittle, and may exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation, such as cracking and
            flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), environmental factors
            (temperature, humidity) cause the adhesive to migrate and concentrate in certain areas, leading to non-uniform
            buildup. After months/years, degradation and oxidation further alter the residue's appearance and distribution.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#654321 dark brown (severely aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, irregular patches, and edge accumulation are common. 'Ghosting' patterns
            mirroring the original tape shape are frequently observed. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges, in corners, and within surface
            crevices. Flat surfaces generally exhibit thinner, more uniform layers. Areas subjected to higher tape pressure
            may exhibit less residue due to adhesive transfer to the tape.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on Europium surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from
            a pale yellow to a brownish hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting
            irregular patterns due to the application and removal of adhesive tapes. The residue tends to accumulate more
            heavily in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Non-uniform distribution is typical. Specific patterns include: edge accumulation, central
            voids (where tape pressure was highest), and ''ghosting'' outlines of the original tape.'
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices due to capillary action and incomplete tape contact in these areas.
            The center may have less residue if the tape was applied with significant pressure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            features (crevices, corners) and be less prevalent on convex surfaces. Sharp edges may exhibit higher concentrations
            due to capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the pattern on vertical surfaces, leading to downward flow and streaking.
            Pooling may occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces or in surface depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more brittle and crusty consistency
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions. Some areas may exhibit a powdery or crystalline appearance
            due to adhesive degradation.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 μm to 50 μm, depending on the adhesive type, application pressure, and
            removal method. Thicker accumulations can reach up to 100 μm in crevices or areas of pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and crusts (in areas of heavy
            accumulation) are common formations. Pooling may occur in surface depressions.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant variations
            in thickness and concentration across the surface.
        fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens, hardens, and becomes less tacky, potentially developing a cracked or crazed surface. Embrittlement and
            discoloration are key indicators of aging.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited (hours). Over days, residue may migrate and redistribute.
            After weeks, hardening and discoloration begin. Months/years lead to embrittlement, cracking, and potential flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2F0E6 (translucent off-white, fresh)'
          - '#E6D8A2 (pale yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B46E (amber, moderately aged)'
          - '#B7853F (brownish-amber, heavily aged)'
          - '#8A5E2B (dark brown, severely degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and irregular patches are common, often concentrated along edges or areas
            where the adhesive tape was initially applied. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces, indicating gravitational
            flow.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices, and along drip lines. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but thinner, layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the initial tape application and subsequent
            cleaning efforts. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in cases of severe adhesive contamination.
          description: Adhesive residue on FRPU typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight
            tackiness to a hardened, brittle layer. Coloration varies from a faint yellowish hue to a more pronounced amber
            or brownish stain, often exhibiting a mottled or streaked appearance due to uneven application or degradation.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread due to pressure,
            temperature, or solvent exposure. Often found around edges and corners of the taped area.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the concentration of adhesive at the tape's edges. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and recessed areas. Textured surfaces may trap residue more readily than smooth surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or dull.
            Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, slightly tacky surface, and eventually
            becoming hard, brittle, and potentially powdery or crusty with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a network
            of fine cracks and fissures in aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick patches), with localized
            buildup potentially reaching up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in low-lying areas, thin films on flat surfaces, and
            crusts or patches in areas of heavy residue buildup.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches with significant
            thickness variations.
        fiberglass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens, hardens, becomes less tacky, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation and
            UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to cure
            and harden. After weeks, discoloration and tackiness decrease. Months/years lead to significant discoloration,
            embrittlement, and potential cracking or flaking of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F5DEB3 light tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burlywood (moderately aged)'
          - '#BC8F8F rosy brown (aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to the initial tape application points, streaks resulting from adhesive
            transfer during tape removal, and drip marks indicating downward flow of the adhesive before it fully cured or
            dried.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners and crevices where adhesive can accumulate, and on flat surfaces where the tape made full contact.
            Lighter concentrations occur in areas where the tape was loosely applied or where adhesive transfer was minimal.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the tape type, application
            method, and removal process. Heavy (>60%) and extreme (>85%) coverage is rare unless multiple layers of tape were
            applied or the adhesive was particularly aggressive.
          description: Adhesive residue on fiberglass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight
            tackiness to a hardened, discolored layer. The residue often exhibits a mottled appearance with variations in
            color and thickness, influenced by the adhesive type and environmental exposure. Dominant colors range from a
            pale yellow to a brownish hue, often concentrated in areas where the tape was initially applied.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and edge deposits are common. The pattern mirrors the original
            tape application, with higher concentrations at the tape's edges and points of contact.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue left
            behind during tape removal. The center area may have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and recessed areas. On curved surfaces, the distribution may be uneven due to variations in contact pressure
            during tape application.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common, especially with adhesives that have low viscosity.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and variations in thickness become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, the texture transitions to a more rigid and potentially brittle state
            with age. Depending on the adhesive, the residue can be smooth, slightly rough, or exhibit a fine, powdery surface
            due to degradation. Some residues may develop a crusty or crystalline appearance over extended periods.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick buildup), but can
            reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of concentrated residue.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces), pools of adhesive in low-lying areas,
            crusts formed by dried or degraded adhesive, and patches corresponding to the shape of the original tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant variations
            in thickness and concentration across the surface.
        fir:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear and highly tacky. Aged residue (months/years) darkens,
            becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle or cracked surface. Dust and debris often become embedded in the
            aged residue.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape removal. Over days, the residue may spread slightly
            due to capillary action. Over months, the residue hardens, darkens, and attracts dust and debris, increasing its
            visibility.

          common_patterns: Localized spots or patches corresponding to the original tape placement, streaks along the grain
            where adhesive was smeared during removal, and distinct edges defining the taped area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            and in crevices or imperfections in the wood surface. Lighter concentrations are observed in the central areas
            of the taped region.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape used, the duration
            of application, and the method of removal. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives
            or prolonged application.
          description: Adhesive residue on fir presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint, covering areas previously protected by tape. The residue exhibits varying degrees of tackiness and can range
            from a thin, almost invisible layer to a thicker, more noticeable accumulation, often following the grain of the
            wood.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was previously applied. Follows the grain of the
            fir wood, creating streaks and elongated patches. Concentrated at the edges of the original tape application.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue accumulation
            during removal.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in depressions and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Raised areas may have thinner or no residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can cause the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in vertical
            streaking and pooling at the bottom edge of the taped area.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly elastic, transitioning to a more brittle and sometimes powdery or
            crusty texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with occasional
            embedded fibers from the tape or wood.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if applied vertically), and crusts or hardened pools
            in areas of heavy accumulation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to uneven patches with significant
            thickness variations.
        float glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically more transparent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes more opaque, discolored (yellowing or browning), and less tacky, often hardening and becoming brittle.
            Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progresses from a thin, even layer immediately after tape removal (hours). Over days,
            the residue may spread slightly due to tackiness. Over weeks/months, it hardens and oxidizes, becoming more visible
            and difficult to remove. Years of exposure lead to significant discoloration and embrittlement.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue with embedded dirt)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include ghosting of the original tape shape, streaks from wiping or cleaning, and
            localized spots where adhesive was concentrated. Fingerprints and smudges are frequently observed within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform layers. Areas subjected to cleaning attempts
            often exhibit lower concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%). Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage
            are most common after initial tape removal. Heavy coverage (60-85%) indicates significant residue buildup.
          description: Adhesive residue on float glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive type
            and removal method. The residue often exhibits a non-uniform distribution with visible patterns from the original
            tape.
          distribution_patterns:
          - 'Ghosting: Outlines of the original tape or label.'
          - 'Streaks: Linear patterns from wiping or cleaning attempts.'
          - 'Spotting: Isolated areas of residue concentration.'
          - 'Edge Buildup: Accumulation of residue along the edges of the tape.'
          - 'Fingerprints: Visible fingerprints embedded in the residue.'
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and the immediate area where the tape was applied. The center of the taped area
            may have less residue if the tape was properly adhered.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and any surface imperfections. Curved surfaces may exhibit uneven coverage due to variations in adhesive contact.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking or pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with freshly applied adhesive.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and thickness variations become more apparent. Iridescence may be observed
            in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness depending on
            the adhesive and cleaning attempts.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from sub-micrometer films (0.1-1 μm) to thicker deposits up to 50 μm, depending
            on the adhesive type and application. Localized buildup can reach up to 100 μm in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), pools of residue
            in low spots, crusts of hardened adhesive, and patches of varying thickness and opacity.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven deposits.
            Uniformity is inversely proportional to the cleaning effort.
        fused silica:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Extreme aging can lead to carbonization, resulting in a
            dark gray or black appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, uniform film. Over weeks/months, oxidation and environmental
            factors cause the residue to thicken and darken. After years, the residue becomes brittle, cracks, and may partially
            detach from the surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (carbonized, extreme aging)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots from tape edges, streaks from wiping, drip marks from adhesive flow, and uniform
            coatings from complete tape coverage.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots or streaks; Light (10-30%) - partial coverage with visible fused
            silica; Moderate (30-60%) - significant coverage, but fused silica still visible; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete
            coverage with minimal exposed fused silica; Extreme (>85%) - complete coverage, obscuring the underlying fused
            silica.
          description: Adhesive residue on fused silica typically appears as a thin, translucent to opaque film, often with
            a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive
            type and application method. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread due to
            cleaning attempts, resulting in streaks or a thin film across the surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and residue accumulation
            during tape removal. The center area under the tape often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects during
            adhesive application and removal. Surface roughness can also trap residue, leading to higher concentrations in
            valleys and crevices.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            a thicker accumulation at the bottom edge of the tape application area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes more opaque, the sheen
            diminishes, resulting in a matte appearance. Under grazing incidence illumination, surface irregularities become
            more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy surface as it dries. Over
            time, it becomes brittle, potentially exhibiting a cracked or crazed surface texture. Heavily aged residue can
            be powdery or crusty, depending on environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces), pools in low-lying areas, crusts (especially
            with aged residue), and patches corresponding to the original tape contact area.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, typically from spin-coating adhesive)
            to highly variable with distinct edges and thickness gradients.
        gallium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and highly adhesive. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to brown or dark brown, becomes less adhesive, and may exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), residue migrates and
            accumulates in crevices and along edges. With further aging (months/years), the residue oxidizes, darkens, and
            becomes more brittle, forming crusts and particulate deposits.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E9D66B dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F peru (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks, and thin films are common. Residue tends to accumulate in
            crevices and along edges.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces
            may exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the initial application of the adhesive
            and the duration of contact. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the adhesive was applied extensively.
          description: Adhesive residue on gallium presents as a thin, often iridescent film with localized areas of thicker,
            discolored buildup. The residue typically exhibits a non-uniform distribution, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, with color variations ranging from translucent yellows to opaque browns depending on age and adhesive
            type.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential accumulation in crevices, along edges, and in areas where
            the adhesive was initially applied. Gravity-induced streaking may also be observed.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. The center of a flat
            surface may exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges due to capillary action and surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling in lower areas.
            Vertical streaking may be observed on vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit iridescence due to thin-film interference. Aged residue tends to be
            matte and may appear dull due to surface oxidation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the residue transitions to a more brittle and crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with areas of smooth film interspersed with
            rough, particulate deposits.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for thin films to 50-200 micrometers in areas of buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, pools (especially in concave areas), crusts (with age), and patches
            of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        gallium arsenide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is nearly invisible, transparent, and highly adhesive. Over time (weeks to months),
            it yellows, becomes less tacky, and may develop a brittle, crusty surface. Extended aging (years) leads to oxidation
            and darkening, resulting in a hardened, less adhesive deposit.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition occurs immediately upon tape application. Buildup progresses over time through
            solvent evaporation and cross-linking of the adhesive polymers. Within hours, the residue becomes less tacky.
            Over days, it hardens. Over months, it oxidizes and darkens.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFFF transparent (fresh)'
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (slightly aged)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (extremely aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks corresponding to tape edges, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a
            general outline mirroring the original tape shape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at tape edges and corners due to adhesive squeeze-out during application
            and incomplete removal. Lighter concentrations in the central areas of the tape imprint. Crevices and surface
            imperfections tend to accumulate more residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape, application pressure, and removal
            technique. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare, typically only occurring with deliberate over-application of adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on Gallium Arsenide appears as a non-uniform, thin film, ranging from transparent
            to a hazy, yellowish-brown. Coverage is typically localized, following the original tape pattern, with variations
            in thickness and color intensity. The residue often exhibits a slight sheen under direct light.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, localized to areas previously covered by adhesive tape. Concentrated along tape
            edges and corners, with thinner films in the central areas of the tape imprint.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and incomplete removal. The center of the tape imprint
            typically has a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., scratches, etched patterns) influence residue accumulation.
            Residue tends to accumulate in valleys and along edges of surface features.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive during application
            and before complete drying. This results in thicker deposits at the bottom of the tape imprint.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte
            or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Interference fringes may be visible in very thin films under specific lighting
            conditions.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a dry, powdery, or crusty texture with age.
            Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with potential for micro-cracking in aged
            samples.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, with localized buildups reaching up to 10-20 micrometers
            at tape edges or drip points.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in surface depressions), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches corresponding to the original tape contact area.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly imperceptible films to localized, thicker deposits.
            Uniformity is generally poor, reflecting the uneven application and removal of the tape.
        gallium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or even black, becomes brittle, and may exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation. It also becomes
            harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial application results in a thin film. Over hours/days, solvent evaporation causes the
            adhesive to become more concentrated and viscous. Over weeks/months, oxidation and degradation lead to hardening,
            discoloration, and increased difficulty in removal. Particulate contamination can also accumulate over time.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged, concentrated)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (residue with particulate contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid), and
            a thin, uneven film covering the surface. Fingerprints are also common patterns.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges and corners where adhesive tends to pool. Lighter concentration
            on flat surfaces. Crevices and surface imperfections can also trap adhesive, leading to localized buildup.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the adhesive
            was intentionally applied over a large area.
          description: Adhesive residue on GaN surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown
            hue, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. Over time, it can darken and become more localized, forming
            distinct marks or patches. The residue's appearance is heavily influenced by the type of adhesive used and environmental
            factors.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated at edges, corners, and areas where tape was applied. Streaks
            are common from wiping or tape removal. Can also be a thin, almost invisible film across the entire surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects and pooling. Center areas tend to
            have thinner, more uniform coverage.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., steps, mesas) on the GaN substrate influence adhesive distribution.
            Adhesive tends to accumulate in valleys and around sharp edges.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive is applied as a liquid, gravity will cause downward flow and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or even dull,
            especially if it has accumulated dust or other contaminants. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain adhesives
            and thin-film interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and slightly sticky. As it ages, it can become rough, crusty,
            or even powdery, depending on the adhesive composition and environmental conditions. Microscopic examination may
            reveal a network of fine cracks or a granular surface.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 10-20 micrometers in areas of concentrated
            buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (at edges or in depressions), crusts
            (aged residue), and patches (where tape was applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform. Depends heavily on the application method and
            the properties of the adhesive.
        germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and translucent. Aged residue (months/years) becomes darker,
            more opaque, brittle, and prone to cracking and flaking. Color shifts towards darker browns.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, even film. Over days, solvent evaporation leads
            to increased viscosity and potential for pooling. Over weeks/months, oxidation and polymerization cause hardening,
            darkening, and cracking. After years, the residue becomes a brittle, dark brown crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E3D075 light yellow-brown'
          - '#C8B486 yellowish-brown (typical)'
          - '#A68B64 medium brown (aged)'
          - '#735C42 dark brown (heavily aged)'
          common_patterns: Streaks, localized spots, edge buildup, and fingerprint-like patterns are common. Drip marks may
            be present on vertically oriented surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration is typically observed at edges, corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces
            tend to have a thinner, more even coating, unless disturbed during tape removal.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) being the most common.
            Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage are rare, usually indicating excessive adhesive use or poor cleaning
            practices.
          description: Adhesive residue on Germanium typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown
            (#C8B486) hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a moderate, streaky coating, often concentrated along edges
            and corners. Over time, it darkens and becomes more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is typical. Streaks are common from tape removal. Localized spots
            occur where adhesive initially contacted the surface. Edge buildup happens due to capillary action and solvent
            evaporation.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and solvent evaporation during the adhesive
            setting process. The center of a flat surface typically has less residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and any surface imperfections. Sharp edges can create stress points leading to cracking of the residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence is rare but possible with specific adhesive types and thicknesses.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rough, brittle, and sometimes
            powdery surface as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with potential
            for micro-cracking.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 20 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in surface imperfections, brittle
            crusts (aged), and patchy residues are common formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films (rare) to highly
            non-uniform distributions with thick and thin areas.
        glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically more transparent and pliable, exhibiting a strong adhesive
            quality. Aged residue (months/years) becomes more opaque, brittle, and discolored, often developing a hardened,
            crusty surface and losing its adhesive properties. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to the darkening and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), dust and debris adhere
            to the sticky surface, increasing the thickness and opacity. Months/years of exposure lead to oxidation, embrittlement,
            and the formation of a crusty layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C khaki'
          - '#E6D8A7 pale yellow-beige'
          - '#D2B48C tan'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the tape's direction of removal, drip marks if the adhesive
            was applied in a liquid form, and areas of uniform coating where the tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners,
            and within crevices or surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) are the most common coverage ranges. Extreme coverage (>85%) is
            rare unless the tape was deliberately applied to cover a large area.
          description: Adhesive residue on GFRP typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a slight yellow
            or brown tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the tape type and removal
            method. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along fiber weave patterns.
          distribution_patterns: On GFRP, the residue tends to accumulate within the weave of the glass fibers, creating a
            non-uniform distribution. It also adheres more readily to areas with surface imperfections or pre-existing contaminants.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and stress concentrations during removal. The center
            area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to stress concentrations during tape
            removal. Curved surfaces may exhibit streaking patterns due to the tape conforming to the shape.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking patterns,
            especially on vertical GFRP surfaces. Pooling may occur in horizontal areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light more readily. Aged residue
            tends to have a matte appearance due to surface degradation and increased roughness. Under oblique lighting, the
            residue's thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more brittle and sometimes powdery
            or crusty feel as it ages and oxidizes. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees
            of smoothness and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and GFRP surface finish.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations occurring in areas
            of overlap or where the adhesive was applied more heavily.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts formed
            by hardened residue, and patches where the tape was incompletely removed.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly localized and
            uneven accumulations. The uniformity is strongly dependent on the tape application and removal process.
        gneiss:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, pliable, and tacky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to brown or gray, becomes brittle, and loses tackiness. Dust and debris accumulate on the
            surface, further obscuring the original color and texture.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film. Over days, tackiness attracts dust and debris.
            Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and hardening. Over years, the residue becomes
            brittle, cracked, and heavily contaminated with environmental particles.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (dust-covered, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from adhesive run-off, drip marks
            on vertical surfaces, and uniform coating where tape covered the entire surface. Often concentrated along edges
            and in crevices of the gneiss.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges of previous tape application, in crevices and surface
            irregularities of the gneiss, and at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity. Lighter concentrations on
            flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the original tape application and subsequent cleaning
            efforts. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on gneiss presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, following the contours of the original adhesive
            application. The residue exhibits a range of textures from smooth and slightly tacky to hardened and brittle depending
            on age and adhesive type.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, streaked, uniform coating, edge concentration, crevice filling, drip marks.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and difficulty in cleaning
            those areas. Center areas may have more uniform, thinner coatings.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in concave areas and along edges. Convex surfaces may have thinner,
            more uniform coatings due to easier removal or weathering.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, adhesive residue exhibits downward flow patterns, resulting in drip marks
            and thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slightly tacky, transitioning to a rougher, sometimes crystalline or powdery
            texture with age. Can exhibit a crusty or brittle surface, especially in areas of thicker accumulation. Microscopic
            examination reveals a network of fine cracks and fissures in aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick accumulations), with an
            average thickness of 10-100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, pools in depressions, crusts on exposed surfaces, patches corresponding
            to tape contact points.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular accumulations
            with significant thickness variations.
        gold:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to amber or brown, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation and environmental factors accelerate
            this process.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to dry and
            oxidize, leading to color changes and increased viscosity. After months, the residue hardens, darkens, and may
            crack or flake off, with dust and debris becoming embedded in the surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2E719 pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E0C242 light amber (slightly aged)'
          - '#C99D6B medium amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B77941 dark amber (aged)'
          - '#965A27 dark brown (heavily aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks (if applied as a liquid adhesive), and a
            general film coating are common. Fingerprints and other surface contaminants often become embedded within the
            residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners where adhesive may have pooled, and in crevices or surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have
            thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial application and removal process. Light
            (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common after tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on gold surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish-brown
            (initially) to dark brown (aged) discoloration. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often
            exhibiting uneven distribution and edge effects.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated around edges, corners, and areas where tape was initially
            applied. Streaks and smudges are common due to the removal process.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges. Residue tends to accumulate along the edges of the original tape application
            due to adhesive squeeze-out and incomplete removal.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Recessed areas and corners tend to accumulate
            more residue, while raised surfaces may have thinner coatings due to wiping or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes rougher, the sheen diminishes,
            resulting in a matte appearance. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain adhesive types and thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rough, crusty, and sometimes
            powdery surface as it ages and oxidizes. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures depending on
            the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick deposits). In extreme
            cases, pooled or dripped residue can reach thicknesses of up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened adhesive, crusts formed
            by oxidation and drying, and patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from near-perfect uniformity in thin-film applications to highly
            irregular and patchy distributions in areas with pooled or dripped adhesive.
        gorilla glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens,
            becomes more brittle, and attracts dust, leading to a duller, more visible appearance. Oxidation can cause further
            discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, often invisible film is present (hours). Over days, the residue becomes
            more visible as it attracts dust and begins to oxidize. After weeks to months, it hardens, darkens, and becomes
            more difficult to remove. Years of buildup can result in a thick, crusty layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E9D66B dark khaki (moderate aging)'
          - '#C04000 burnt umber (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (contaminated with dirt/dust)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from wiping, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), and uniform coating (if
            tape was fully adhered). Fingerprints and smudges are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges where the adhesive was initially applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the adhesive type, application method, and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common after typical tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on Gorilla Glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a
            yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive
            type and removal method. The residue can exhibit a slightly uneven texture and may attract dust and debris over
            time.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common. Areas previously covered by tape edges often exhibit
            higher concentrations. Wiping motions create streaks and smears.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges, especially where the tape was initially applied. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform coating or be relatively clean if the tape was removed carefully.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along
            edges, and in any surface imperfections. Curved surfaces may exhibit uneven coating due to differential adhesion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, especially
            when contaminated with dust. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain adhesive types and thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, slightly rough, or even crusty
            texture as it ages and dries. Microscopic examination may reveal a network of fine cracks or a powdery surface.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thicker, pooled residue).
            Heavily built-up areas can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (from liquid adhesives), pools (in depressions), crusts (from dried,
            oxidized residue), and patches (where tape was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, after very careful application and
            removal) to highly variable with distinct patches and streaks.
        granite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens, becomes brittle, and attracts dirt, resulting in a more visible and less adhesive surface.
            Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and hardening.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, clear film. Over weeks, the film becomes more visible
            and tacky. After months, the residue darkens, hardens, and attracts dirt, forming a crusty layer. Years of exposure
            can lead to significant discoloration and permanent staining.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC (Beige - Fresh)'
          - '#E3DAC9 (Pale Yellow - Slightly Aged)'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan - Moderately Aged)'
          - '#B8860B (Dark Khaki - Heavily Aged/Oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 (Saddle Brown - Extreme Aging/Contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks
            if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. A common pattern is a rectangular or linear outline mirroring the
            original tape shape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application, as well as in crevices or surface imperfections on the granite. Lighter concentrations are present
            in the central areas and on smoother, less porous surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape and the
            duration of application. Heavy (>60%) to extreme (>85%) coverage is rare, usually only occurring with intentional
            adhesive application beyond tape use.
          description: 'Adhesive residue on granite typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow or
            brown tint, often concentrated in areas where the tape was initially applied. The residue exhibits varying degrees
            of tackiness and can range from a barely visible sheen to a noticeable, discolored patch. Dominant colors are
            #F5F5DC (beige) and #D2B48C (tan).'
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where tape was applied, often forming rectangular or linear outlines.
            Can also spread slightly beyond the original tape boundary due to adhesive creep or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners of the tape application area due to increased pressure and adhesive
            transfer during application and removal.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            grooves, and along edges. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes even distribution but can also lead to pooling
            in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct light, fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte
            due to accumulated dirt and surface degradation. The residue may appear more visible under oblique lighting, highlighting
            surface irregularities.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rougher, sometimes powdery or
            crusty feel as it ages and attracts dust and debris. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with
            varying degrees of smoothness depending on the adhesive type and granite porosity.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas
            of heavy buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), crusts (in aged residue), and patches
            corresponding to the shape of the tape. Small pools may form in surface depressions.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker deposits at the edges
            and corners of the tape application area and thinner films in the center.
        hafnium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically transparent or translucent with a strong adhesive quality.
            Aged residue (months/years) becomes opaque, darker in color, less tacky, and may exhibit cracking or flaking.
            Oxidation and dust accumulation contribute to the color change and increased roughness.
          buildup_progression: Initially (hours), a thin, transparent film is present. Within days, dust and contaminants
            begin to adhere, causing discoloration. Over weeks/months, oxidation and cross-linking occur, leading to hardening,
            darkening, and increased roughness. After years, the residue can become brittle and flake off, leaving behind
            a stained surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (dust-contaminated, aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied vertically), and
            a general film-like coating. Fingerprints or other contact marks are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges and corners of the original tape
            application area, in crevices, and at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity. Flat surfaces tend to have
            a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape, application method,
            and removal process. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the tape was left on for an extended period or multiple
            layers were applied.
          description: Adhesive residue on Hafnium presents as a patchy, often iridescent film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, exhibiting varying degrees of tackiness depending
            on age and environmental conditions. It often appears as a thin, uneven coating with localized thicker deposits.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential accumulation in surface imperfections, scratches, and along
            edges. Often follows the pattern of the original tape application, leaving distinct rectangular or linear marks.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects and the tendency for adhesive to
            squeeze out from under the tape during application. The center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform
            coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Scratches and grooves act as collection points, leading to localized buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or dull.
            Iridescence can be observed in thin films due to interference effects, particularly with certain adhesive types.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rougher, less tacky, and sometimes powdery
            or crusty texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and occasional crystalline structures forming within the residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for thin films to 50-200 micrometers for localized deposits
            or drip marks. Extreme cases of buildup can reach up to 1 millimeter.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age and
            oxidation), and patches (where tape was unevenly applied or removed).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, extremely thin films to thick, localized
            deposits. Uniformity is generally poor, especially after tape removal.
        hastelloy:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to amber or brown, becomes less tacky, and may harden or crack. Exposure to UV light accelerates the aging
            process, leading to increased discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), the adhesive may flow or
            spread slightly. With prolonged exposure (months/years), the residue hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake
            off, leaving behind a more concentrated and localized deposit.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Pale Yellow, fresh)'
          - '#C8B486 (Yellowish-Brown, slightly aged)'
          - '#A67B5B (Amber, moderately aged)'
          - '#806449 (Dark Brown, heavily aged)'
          - '#FFFFFF (Chalky white, residue after cleaning attempts)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid adhesive),
            and a general film coating. Residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and in crevices. Lighter concentration on flat
            surfaces. Areas directly under the original tape or adhesive application will have the highest concentration.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is possible in areas
            of direct adhesive application or pooling. Extreme (>85%) is rare.
          description: Adhesive residue on Hastelloy typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish-brown
            (#C8B486) or amber (#A67B5B) hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a moderate, uneven coating, often concentrated
            along edges and corners. The residue can exhibit a slightly tacky or hardened texture depending on age and adhesive
            type.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where the adhesive was
            initially applied. Streaks are common from tape removal. Can also see 'ghosting' where the adhesive protected
            the Hastelloy from oxidation or other surface treatments, leaving a slightly different surface finish.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension. The center of a flat
            surface typically has the lowest concentration.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, crevices,
            and along edges due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform
            coating.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be more matte. The thin film nature of the residue often results in minimal light reflection.
          texture_details: Initially, the residue is often smooth and slightly sticky. Over time, it can harden and become
            less tacky, sometimes developing a slightly crusty or powdery texture, especially after exposure to heat or UV
            light. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly irregular surface with small ridges or bumps.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (in low-lying areas), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches (where tape was applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly perfectly uniform (rare, only with very thin, evenly
            applied adhesives) to highly non-uniform with significant variations in thickness and coverage.
        hickory:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Over time (weeks to months), it hardens, yellows,
            and becomes more difficult to remove. Years of aging result in a brittle, often cracked, and deeply embedded residue.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible film (0-24 hours). Tackiness increases dust
            accumulation (1-7 days). Yellowing and hardening begin (1-4 weeks). Brittle crust formation and deeper penetration
            into the wood grain occur over months to years.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Light Yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#E3D5A3 (Beige, slightly aged)'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B (Dark Goldenrod, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 (SaddleBrown, residue with embedded dirt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if
            adhesive was liquid, and a general film coating.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at the edges of the original tape application, in corners and crevices
            of the wood grain, and where drips or pooling occurred. Lighter concentrations on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) or extreme (>85%) coverage is
            rare, usually only occurring in areas of repeated tape application or spills.
          description: Adhesive residue on hickory presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the tape's original application.
            The residue tends to accumulate in the wood grain and around imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, films, and accumulations in wood grain.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape application and areas where the tape was torn or cut. Center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas, such as wood grain patterns and imperfections.
            Edges and corners act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of liquid adhesive results in vertical streaking and pooling at the bottom of vertical
            surfaces. Gravity also contributes to the formation of drip marks.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte, with reduced reflectivity.
            Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities caused by the residue become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film or a brittle, powdery
            crust with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers for thin films to 100-500 micrometers for thicker accumulations
            or drip marks.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in depressions, crusts on exposed surfaces,
            and patches where tape was repeatedly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly variable accumulations
            and spotty coverage.
        inconel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue (months/years) becomes hardened,
            brittle, and more difficult to remove. Color darkens significantly with oxidation and UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is rapid, forming a thin film. Over time (weeks/months), the residue
            hardens, darkens, and becomes more difficult to remove. Further buildup (years) results in a thick, crusty layer
            that may require aggressive cleaning methods.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2E7D5 ivory-white (fresh, thin)'
          - '#E0C8A2 pale-yellow (fresh, thicker)'
          - '#C89B64 tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#A5693F light-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#7B421E dark-brown (heavily aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from wiping, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a thin, uneven coating
            are common. Residue often accumulates around edges and corners.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and in surface imperfections (scratches, pits).
            Lighter concentration on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common after cleaning attempts. Heavy (>60%) coverage
            indicates poor cleaning or intentional adhesive application.
          description: Adhesive residue on Inconel typically presents as a thin, patchy film with a translucent to opaque
            appearance. Fresh residue often exhibits a yellowish-tan hue, while aged residue tends to darken to a brownish-orange.
            Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate films, depending on the adhesive type and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, thin films, and edge/corner accumulation are typical. The pattern
            is highly dependent on the application method of the tape and the cleaning process.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and difficulty in reaching these areas during
            cleaning. Center areas of flat surfaces tend to have less residue.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in concave geometries (corners, pits) due to capillary action and
            difficulty in cleaning. Convex surfaces tend to have less residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive, leading to
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially when thicker. Aged residue tends
            to be matte. The thin film nature of the residue often causes subtle interference patterns under specific lighting
            conditions.
          texture_details: Fresh residue is often sticky and slightly glossy. As it ages, it can become less sticky, more
            brittle, and develop a slightly rough or crusty texture. Microscopic examination may reveal a non-crystalline,
            amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, and crusts around
            the edges of residue patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, even with spray-on adhesives. Non-uniformity is
            the norm.
        indium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Over time (weeks to months), it becomes
            more opaque, darker (amber to brown), harder, and potentially brittle, developing a crusty or cracked surface.
            Oxidation and environmental factors accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape removal. Within hours, the residue begins to spread
            slightly due to surface tension. Over days, it becomes more visible as it attracts dust and debris. Over weeks
            to months, oxidation and environmental factors cause it to harden, darken, and potentially develop a crusty texture.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3C16F dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (burnt/heat-affected)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            if the adhesive was applied in liquid form, and overall film-like coatings.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners
            and crevices, and around surface imperfections. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, application pressure,
            and removal technique. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or improper removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on Indium surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow
            or amber tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting irregular patterns
            due to the tape's adhesive properties and removal process. The residue's appearance changes over time, becoming
            more opaque and potentially developing a crusty texture.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape footprint and in
            areas where the tape was under greater pressure. Can also follow surface imperfections or scratches on the Indium.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the 'edge effect' during tape application and removal, where adhesive
            tends to accumulate at the perimeter of the tape.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and recessed areas due to capillary action and
            the tape's inability to conform perfectly to complex geometries. Sharp edges often exhibit thicker buildup.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity will cause downward flow and pooling, resulting
            in vertical streaking and thicker deposits at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This effect is less pronounced
            with pressure-sensitive adhesives.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with potential
            iridescence in areas where the film is thicker or has undergone significant oxidation. Lighting angle significantly
            affects visibility.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, sometimes powdery or crusty texture with
            age and oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals irregular surface features and potential crystalline structures
            in aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 20 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts on aged
            residue, and irregular patches corresponding to the original tape contact area.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly irregular patches
            and streaks.
        indium phosphide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellowish and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to a brownish or even blackish color, becomes brittle, and loses its tackiness. Cracking and flaking may
            also occur.
          buildup_progression: Initially (minutes/hours), a thin, even film is deposited. Over the next few days, the residue
            may redistribute slightly due to surface tension and gravity. Over weeks/months, oxidation and degradation occur,
            leading to darkening, embrittlement, and increased roughness. Particulate matter from the environment can also
            become embedded in the residue over time.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD (Lemon Chiffon) - Fresh residue, very thin'
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki) - Slightly thicker, more concentrated residue'
          - '#B8860B (DarkGoldenrod) - Aged residue, oxidized'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna) - Heavily aged, degraded residue'
          - '#696969 (DimGray) - Residue with particulate contamination'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with tape removal direction, irregular patches, and a thin film
            covering the entire surface are common. Fingerprints and other handling marks can also be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the InP substrate,
            as well as in crevices and surface defects. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application method and
            the type of adhesive used. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on Indium Phosphide (InP) surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film
            with a yellowish-brown tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns and localized concentrations. Over time,
            it can darken and become more brittle, exhibiting a slight tackiness initially that diminishes with age.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is typical. Residue tends to accumulate at the edges of the InP
            wafer or die, along scribe lines, and in areas where the tape was initially applied with greater pressure.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and accumulation during tape application
            and removal. The center of the InP surface typically has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences the distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges. Sharp corners and edges act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity can cause downward flow and pooling, resulting
            in vertical streaking and thicker accumulations at the bottom of the InP substrate. This is more pronounced during
            the initial application and curing stages.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to
            be matte and may show some iridescence due to surface cracking and oxidation. Oblique lighting highlights the
            surface irregularities.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is slightly sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rougher, more brittle,
            and sometimes powdery texture as it ages and degrades. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with
            varying degrees of roughness depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 10 micrometers in areas
            of heavy accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if the adhesive was applied in liquid form), and
            crusts (in heavily aged areas) are common formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with significant variations in
            thickness and concentration across the surface.
        iridium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears as a glossy, transparent or translucent film. Over time (weeks to months),
            it yellows, darkens, and becomes more opaque, often developing a brittle or cracked surface. Oxidation and environmental
            contaminants contribute to the color change.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation causes the
            residue to become more concentrated and viscous. Weeks to months lead to oxidation, cross-linking, and the formation
            of a hard, crusty layer. Years result in significant discoloration and potential for chemical bonding with the
            Iridium surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale goldenrod (fresh)'
          - '#E3C16F light khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#C2994D dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#A67D3D golden brown (aged)'
          - '#806517 dark goldenrod (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from wiping or cleaning attempts, and thin films. Drip marks may be present
            on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in surface crevices
            or scratches. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more even coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy coverage (60-85%) is rare and usually
            indicates poor cleaning practices. Extreme coverage (>85%) is unlikely unless the adhesive was intentionally applied
            across the entire surface.
          description: Adhesive residue on Iridium typically presents as a thin, patchy film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue, often exhibiting iridescent effects due to the thin-film interference. Coverage varies from sparse to moderate,
            depending on the adhesive type and removal method, with a tendency to accumulate in surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy distribution is most common. Can also appear as a thin, almost invisible
            film across the entire surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects during adhesive application and removal.
            The center often has a thinner, more uniform coating if any.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges. Sharp corners can act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking, leading to thicker accumulations
            at the bottom. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen and potential for iridescence due to thin-film interference.
            Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees of crystallinity depending on
            the adhesive composition.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and small, discrete patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from almost perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly localized
            and concentrated deposits.
        iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared, exhibiting a strong adhesive tack. Over time (months/years),
            it hardens, becomes brittle, and may darken in color due to oxidation and UV exposure. Aged residue is more difficult
            to remove and may leave a stain on the iron surface.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, slight flow and redistribution
            may occur. After weeks/months, drying and hardening begin, leading to crust formation. After years, the residue
            becomes brittle, discolored, and difficult to remove, potentially interacting with the iron surface to promote
            corrosion.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F peru (aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, potential rust interaction)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, outlines of the original tape, drip marks (if applied vertically), and
            a general film coating. Fingerprints or other surface contaminants may be embedded within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Edges of the tape outline often exhibit higher concentrations of residue. Corners and
            crevices tend to accumulate more residue than flat surfaces. Areas subjected to cleaning may have reduced residue
            concentration.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is rare, typically only
            occurring in areas of deliberate over-application or extreme neglect. Extreme (>85%) is almost never seen.
          description: Adhesive residue on iron presents as a thin, often translucent or yellowish film, sometimes with distinct
            edges corresponding to the original tape. Coverage varies from sparse to moderate, with color changes indicating
            aging and oxidation of the adhesive components and potential interaction with the iron surface. The residue often
            exhibits a streaky or patchy distribution.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was previously applied. Can also spread slightly
            beyond the original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or cleaning attempts. Crevices and surface imperfections
            may trap more residue.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges, where the tape was initially adhered. The center of the taped area may have
            a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and depressions. Raised areas may have less residue due to abrasion or cleaning.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            a higher concentration of residue at the bottom. Pooling may occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light. As it ages and dries, the surface
            becomes more matte. Under oblique lighting, the edges of the residue may be more visible due to variations in
            surface texture.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a dry, sometimes crusty or powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface with small ridges or bumps corresponding
            to the adhesive's original structure. Can also be smooth if the adhesive has fully dried and flattened.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (uneven application or removal).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from a relatively uniform thin film to highly uneven patches and
            streaks.
        kevlar-reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years),
            it darkens to a brownish hue, becomes less tacky, and may crack or flake. Embedded dust and debris contribute
            to a grayer, dirtier appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial deposition occurs immediately upon tape application. Over the first few hours, the
            adhesive may spread slightly. Over days, solvent evaporation leads to increased viscosity and tackiness. Over
            months/years, oxidation, UV exposure, and dust accumulation cause degradation, embrittlement, and discoloration.

          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 Wheat (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on
            vertical surfaces, and a general film covering the surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges of the original tape application,
            in corners and crevices, and on vertical surfaces where gravity causes pooling. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%), light (10-30%), moderate (30-60%), heavy (60-85%), extreme (>85%) - all are possible
            depending on the tape used and removal process.
          description: Adhesive residue on Kevlar-reinforced polymer presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with
            a slight yellow or brown tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the
            original tape application. The residue tends to accumulate in surface irregularities and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, thin films, and pooled areas. Distribution is heavily influenced
            by the original tape application and surface topography of the Kevlar-reinforced polymer.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to squeeze
            out during tape application. The center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in valleys, grooves,
            and around raised features. Sharp edges often exhibit a higher concentration of residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks on vertical surfaces and
            pooling in low-lying areas. This effect is more pronounced with fresh, more fluid residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte, with reduced reflectivity. The presence of embedded particles can create a subtle, uneven
            light scattering effect.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more brittle and sometimes powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and degradation level. Some areas may exhibit a slight crystalline structure due
            to adhesive component separation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (sparse residue) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue).
            In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 200 micrometers in localized areas.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (corresponding to tape contact areas).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, after careful application) to highly
            non-uniform with distinct spots and streaks.
        lanthanum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and very sticky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to amber or brown, becomes less sticky, and may crack or flake. Oxidation can lead to a
            dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), dust and contaminants accumulate,
            increasing the thickness and darkening the color. After months/years, oxidation and degradation lead to cracking,
            flaking, and a powdery surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker film)'
          - '#E3C16F ''Dark Khaki'' (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B ''Dark Goldenrod'' (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (extremely aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on
            vertical surfaces, and a general film covering the exposed area. Fingerprints or other surface contaminants can
            influence the residue pattern.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices, and around surface imperfections. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, smooth surfaces away
            from the tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, application pressure, and removal
            technique. Light (10-30%) is common for single tape applications with clean removal. Moderate (30-60%) indicates
            multiple tape applications or incomplete removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on Lanthanum surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            from a faint yellowish tint to a darker amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings,
            often exhibiting irregular patterns and edge effects. The residue tends to be sticky initially, hardening and
            yellowing with age.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at tape edges and contact points. Can be affected
            by surface roughness and contamination, leading to localized variations in thickness and coverage.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and incomplete removal at
            the edges. The center area directly under the tape is often less affected, resulting in a 'frame' of residue.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects during
            tape application and removal. Concave surfaces may trap residue more effectively than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker deposits at the bottom. Pooling can occur in horizontal crevices or depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte due to surface
            oxidation and degradation. Thicker deposits may show some light refraction, creating a subtle iridescent effect.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, hard, and sometimes brittle texture with
            age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface with small ridges or cracks, especially in thicker
            deposits. Can become powdery with extreme age and oxidation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for thin films to 50-200 micrometers for thicker deposits
            or pooled areas. Extreme buildup can reach up to 1 millimeter in localized spots.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in low-lying areas, crusts around edges of
            thicker deposits, and patches corresponding to tape contact points.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven deposits.
        lead:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically soft, pliable, and translucent. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes hardened, brittle, opaque, and may exhibit discoloration due to oxidation or environmental contamination.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, even layer. Over weeks, dust and debris accumulate,
            increasing opacity. Months/years lead to hardening, discoloration, and potential crust formation, with thickness
            increasing in areas of pooling or repeated exposure.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F5DEB3 light beige (slightly aged)'
          - '#E9C46A mustard yellow (moderately aged)'
          - '#D4A373 tan (aged)'
          - '#A0785A dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include linear streaks corresponding to tape edges, circular or oval spots where
            tape was applied, and irregular patches where adhesive spread unevenly. Drip marks may be present on vertical
            surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in crevices, and in areas where the adhesive pooled. Lighter concentrations are found in the center of the tape
            area or on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) are the most common coverage ranges. Extreme coverage (>85%) is
            rare unless the entire surface was intentionally coated with adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on lead surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from
            a pale yellow to a brownish hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to extensive coatings, often exhibiting patterns
            related to the original tape application. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, edge accumulation, uniform thin film, drip patterns (on vertical
            surfaces).
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive bleed-out from the tape and capillary action. The center often
            has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and recessed areas due to capillary action and reduced exposure to cleaning efforts.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks on vertical surfaces
            and pooling on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence is not typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more brittle, sometimes powdery
            or crusty consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: The thickness of adhesive residue typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations
            in areas of pooling or repeated application. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 100-200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (aged
            residue), patches (irregular coverage).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly non-uniform
            with thick accumulations and sparse areas.
        lead crystal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically soft, pliable, and easily smeared. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes hardened, brittle, and more resistant to removal, often exhibiting a darker, more oxidized color.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time in stages: (1) Initial adhesion (hours): a thin, even layer is
            deposited. (2) Flow and pooling (days): gravity and surface tension cause the adhesive to flow and pool. (3) Oxidation
            and hardening (weeks): the residue begins to oxidize and harden, changing color and texture. (4) Degradation and
            cracking (months/years): the residue continues to degrade, becoming brittle and prone to cracking.'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, minimal degradation)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, initial oxidation)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, increased oxidation)'
          - '#CD853F ''Peru'' (significantly aged, advanced degradation)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, carbonized residue)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots where the tape was initially applied, streaks from adhesive
            flow, and distinct outlines mirroring the shape of the original tape. Residue often accumulates along edges and
            in surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically observed at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners and crevices, and along any surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges vary widely depending on the application. Sparse (<10%) to light (10-30%) coverage
            is common after tape removal. Moderate (30-60%) to heavy (60-85%) coverage indicates significant residue buildup.
            Extreme (>85%) coverage is rare but possible with prolonged tape application and degradation.
          description: Adhesive residue on lead crystal typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in color
            from pale yellow to brownish-orange, often with irregular coverage and distinct edges. The residue's appearance
            varies significantly based on the adhesive type, age, and environmental exposure, creating a visually disruptive
            layer on the crystal's surface.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, edge accumulation, streaks, and full surface films are all common distribution
            patterns on lead crystal.
          edge_center_behavior: The residue exhibits a strong preference for edges, where it tends to accumulate due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences residue distribution. Edges and corners act as collection
            points, while curved surfaces may exhibit streaking due to adhesive flow. Recessed areas tend to accumulate more
            residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern, particularly on vertical surfaces.
            This results in downward flow, pooling at the bottom, and vertical streaking of the adhesive residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen, reflecting light in a diffuse manner. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte, with reduced reflectivity and increased light scattering due to surface degradation and
            oxidation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more rigid and sometimes brittle
            state with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with areas of smooth film interspersed with
            regions of aggregated residue and potential micro-cracking.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue layer typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations
            occurring at edges and in areas of pooling. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces), pools of
            accumulated residue, hardened crusts in areas of heavy buildup, and small, isolated patches.
          uniformity_assessment: The residue distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically highly variable, with
            areas of concentrated buildup and regions of minimal coverage.
        limestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically soft, pliable, and strongly adhesive. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes brittle, hard, and less adhesive, often darkening in color and attracting dust/dirt.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation causes the
            adhesive to become more viscous. After weeks, oxidation and dust accumulation begin to darken the residue. Months
            to years lead to hardening, embrittlement, and potential chemical bonding with the limestone surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F7F4E8 translucent yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E3D5B5 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#C4A484 brownish-yellow (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0785A dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#D8BFD8 light lavender (some tape types)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines matching the original tape dimensions, streaks from
            adhesive transfer during removal, and localized spots where adhesive remained concentrated.
          concentration_variations: Edges and corners of the original tape area often exhibit heavier concentrations of residue
            due to adhesive squeeze-out. Crevices and porous areas of the limestone can also trap and concentrate residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) being the most common. Heavy (>60%) and
            extreme (>85%) coverage is less frequent, usually indicating excessive adhesive use.
          description: Adhesive residue on limestone typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a light
            yellow (#F7F4E8) to a brownish-yellow (#C4A484) depending on the adhesive type and age. Coverage varies from sparse
            spots to a more uniform coating, often revealing the original tape pattern.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, streaks, spots, and overall film coverage are common. Distribution
            is heavily influenced by the original tape application and removal process.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges of the original tape application area tend to have higher concentrations of residue
            compared to the center.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities (pores, cracks, tool marks) influence residue distribution, leading to
            accumulation in depressions and reduced coverage on raised areas.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            streaks. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue tends
            to be matte and can appear more visible under oblique lighting due to increased surface roughness and dirt accumulation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture evolves to become less tacky and more powdery
            or crusty with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with potential for
            embedded particulate matter from the environment.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Average
            thickness is typically between 10-100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), small pools in surface depressions, crusts formed
            by drying and oxidation, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly variable distributions
            with thick and thin areas.
        magnesium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Aged residue darkens to brown or even
            black, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation of the magnesium substrate underneath the residue
            can also contribute to color changes.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited. Over hours/days, the adhesive may spread slightly.
            Over weeks/months, the residue oxidizes, darkens, and becomes more brittle. Over years, the residue may degrade
            further, crack, and flake off, potentially leaving behind a stained or etched surface on the magnesium.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin residue)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker residue)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            if adhesive was applied in liquid form, and uniform coating if the tape covered the entire surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners,
            and in crevices. Lighter concentrations are found on flat surfaces where the tape made less direct contact.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application, and cleaning
            methods used.
          description: Adhesive residue on magnesium typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coverage, often exhibiting patterns related
            to the original tape application. Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized around the area where the tape was applied. Often concentrated at the edges of
            the tape footprint. Can also be found in crevices or surface imperfections where the adhesive flowed.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            less residue if the tape was not applied with uniform pressure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Raised areas may have less residue due to abrasion or cleaning.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause liquid adhesive to flow downward, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to smooth and then rough/brittle with age. May
            exhibit a powdery or crusty surface due to degradation and oxidation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools (in low-lying areas), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (thin film coating) to highly non-uniform
            (localized spots and streaks).
        mahogany:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Over time (months/years), it darkens
            to a brownish hue, becomes more brittle, and may crack or flake. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours/days). Over weeks, the residue begins to oxidize
            and may attract dust. After months/years, the residue hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake, with increased
            dust accumulation.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5DEB3 (Beige - Fresh)'
          - '#E3C16F (Light Yellow-Brown - Slightly Aged)'

            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but thinner, layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, depending on the tape type and application.
            Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the tape was heavily applied or left for an extended period.
          description: Adhesive residue on mahogany presents as a translucent to opaque film, often exhibiting a yellowish-brown
            (#A0785A) discoloration. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate films, influenced by the tape's original
            pattern and adhesive type. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Outlines of the original tape, localized spots where the adhesive was concentrated, streaks
            from removal, and general film covering the area where the tape was applied.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges of the tape area typically exhibit higher concentrations of residue due to adhesive
            squeeze-out and the tendency for residue to remain after tape removal. The center area may have a more uniform,
            thinner film.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and depressions due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Raised areas may have less residue due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulation
            at the bottom edge of the tape outline. Pooling may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or have a very
            low sheen. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities caused by the residue become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hard, and sometimes brittle texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly crystalline or amorphous structure depending on the adhesive
            composition. Can also be powdery if the adhesive has degraded.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers for thin films, up to 100-500 micrometers in areas of concentrated
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age and
            oxidation), and distinct patches mirroring the tape's adhesive pattern.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches
            with varying thickness and concentration.
        manganese:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often translucent and pliable, easily smeared. Over time (months/years), it hardens,
            darkens, and becomes brittle, making it more difficult to remove. The color shifts from pale yellow to dark brown,
            and the texture becomes more crusty or powdery.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited upon tape application. Over hours/days, the adhesive
            may flow slightly and begin to cure. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens, darkens, and becomes more difficult
            to remove. Over years, the residue can become deeply embedded in the manganese surface, requiring aggressive cleaning
            methods.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (Pale Yellow - Fresh)'
          - '#E6D7A7 (Beige - Slightly Aged)'
          - '#C4A769 (Tan - Moderately Aged)'
          - '#916F30 (Dark Brown - Aged)'
          - '#63481E (Very Dark Brown - Heavily Aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, outlines of the original tape, and drip marks (if liquid adhesive was
            present). Fingerprints or other handling marks may be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application area. Crevices and surface imperfections also tend to accumulate more residue. Flat surfaces may have
            a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is possible with prolonged
            tape application or repeated applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on manganese surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with
            a yellowish-brown (initially) to dark brown (aged) discoloration. The residue often exhibits a non-uniform distribution,
            following the original tape pattern and leaving distinct outlines. Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate, depending
            on the tape type and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily follows the original tape footprint. Can also spread slightly beyond the tape edges
            due to adhesive flow or capillary action. Residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential for residue
            accumulation during removal. The center area often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences residue distribution. Edges and corners tend to accumulate
            more residue due to increased surface area and potential for adhesive pooling.凹槽和凸起会影响残留物的分布。
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking or pooling
            at the bottom of the application area. This is more pronounced with freshly applied tape or in warmer environments.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte and absorbs light, reducing reflectivity. The manganese surface underneath may appear dulled
            or etched.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a dry, crusty, or powdery texture with age.
            Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness, depending
            on the adhesive type and environmental conditions. Some residues may exhibit a slightly crystalline appearance
            under high magnification.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was present), pools of hardened adhesive, crusts,
            and patches of powdery residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker deposits at the edges
            of the tape and thinner films in the center. Variations depend on the tape application pressure and removal technique.
        maple:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly adhesive. Aged residue darkens,
            becomes brittle, and loses its adhesive properties, often attracting dirt and debris.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, residue may migrate and pool
            slightly. Within weeks, oxidation begins, causing darkening and increased tackiness. After months, residue becomes
            brittle, attracts dirt, and forms a crusty surface. Years later, it may degrade into a powdery or flaky substance.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (residue with embedded dirt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the wood grain, drip marks (if applied vertically), and uniform
            coatings where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges of previous tape application, in crevices and pores of
            the maple, and in areas where adhesive pooled. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - scattered streaks and patches; Moderate (30-60%)
            - partial coating with visible maple surface; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coating; Extreme (>85%) - thick,
            continuous film obscuring the maple grain.
          description: Adhesive residue on maple presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive type and application
            method. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along grain lines.
          distribution_patterns: Grain-aligned streaks, edge accumulation, localized spots where adhesive contact was strongest,
            and overall uniform films.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners of the original tape application area due to adhesive squeeze-out
            and surface tension effects. Center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and depressions due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Flat surfaces receive a thinner, more uniform coating.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulations
            at the bottom of the residue area. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a smooth, sometimes glossy film.
            Over time, it can become rough, crusty, or even powdery due to oxidation and degradation. Microscopic examination
            reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). In extreme
            cases, buildup can reach 100-200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in surface depressions, crusts around
            the edges of residue patches, and patches of varying size and shape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform films (where tape was evenly applied) to highly
            localized spots and streaks.
        marble:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is often clear and pliable. Aged residue (months/years) yellows, hardens,
            and may crack or flake. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to darkening and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours) is a thin, even film. Over days, the adhesive may spread slightly.
            After weeks/months, the residue hardens and begins to yellow. Years of exposure lead to significant discoloration,
            embrittlement, and potential flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#F8F8FF (GhostWhite) - Fresh residue, almost invisible'
          - '#FFFACD (LemonChiffon) - Slightly aged, faint yellow tint'
          - '#EEE8AA (PaleGoldenrod) - Moderately aged, more pronounced yellow'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan) - Aged, brownish discoloration'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna) - Heavily aged, dark brown, potentially oxidized'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines mirroring the original tape, streaks from adhesive
            transfer during removal, and localized spots where adhesive was concentrated. Drip marks may be present on vertical
            surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the original tape outline, in corners,
            and within crevices or surface imperfections of the marble. Flat surfaces tend to have a more even, but potentially
            thinner, distribution.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the tape type, application duration,
            and removal method. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on marble typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to extensive coatings, reflecting the original tape pattern.
            Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, streaks, localized spots, drip marks, and overall film coatings are
            common distribution types on marble.
          edge_center_behavior: Residue often concentrates at the edges of the original tape outline due to adhesive squeeze-out
            during application and incomplete removal during tape removal. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and around raised features. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with freshly applied residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and boundaries become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film. With age and environmental
            exposure, the surface can become rough, brittle, and even powdery, especially if the adhesive contains fillers
            or degrades significantly.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas
            of heavy buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions),
            crusts (with age and oxidation), and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the tape application and removal process. It can range
            from perfectly uniform thin films to highly variable patches and streaks.
        mdf:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often translucent and flexible. Over time (weeks to months), it yellows, hardens,
            and becomes more brittle. Years of aging can lead to significant discoloration and cracking.
          buildup_progression: Initial transfer occurs immediately upon tape removal. Over the first few hours, the residue
            may spread slightly. Within days, it begins to harden. Over months and years, it discolors, embrittles, and may
            crack or flake off.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#654321 chocolate (burnt/heat-aged)'
          common_patterns: Rectangular outlines, linear streaks, and localized spots corresponding to the tape's adhesive
            layer. 'Ghosting' effects may occur where the tape protected the MDF from environmental factors, leaving a cleaner
            area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the tape marks and in areas where
            the tape was creased or folded. Lighter concentrations are typically found in the center of the tape mark.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape and the duration
            of application. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with excessive adhesive transfer.
          description: Adhesive residue on MDF presents as a thin, often glossy or matte film with color variations ranging
            from translucent yellow to opaque brown. Coverage patterns are typically localized to areas where tape was applied,
            leaving distinct rectangular or linear marks. The residue's appearance changes with age, becoming more brittle
            and discolored.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread slightly beyond
            the tape's edges due to adhesive creep.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential capillary
            action. Center areas often have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension.
            Edges and raised areas may exhibit thinner coatings due to abrasion.
          gravity_influence: Minimal influence on thin films. However, thicker applications may exhibit downward flow or pooling,
            resulting in vertical streaking.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or have a dull,
            uneven sheen. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures in some aged residues.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, and occasional drip marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid
            or semi-liquid state. Crusting can occur in areas exposed to heat or UV radiation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Within a single tape mark, the residue thickness and color can vary significantly
            due to uneven adhesive transfer.
        metal matrix composites mmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and translucent. Aged residue (months/years) becomes opaque,
            darker in color, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation of the adhesive components can contribute to the
            color change.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited upon tape removal (hours). Over days, the adhesive
            begins to dry and potentially react with the MMC surface. Over weeks to months, the residue hardens, darkens,
            and may crack or flake, with dust and debris becoming embedded in the surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2E7C6 (Pale Yellow)'
          - '#E0C898 (Light Tan)'
          - '#C6A369 (Medium Beige)'
          - '#A37F4A (Dark Tan/Brown)'
          - '#70542A (Aged Dark Brown)'
          common_patterns: Streaks parallel to the tape removal direction, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated,
            and edge effects where the tape was initially applied.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and within surface crevices of the MMC. Lighter concentrations are observed on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (60-85%) coverage can occur in areas
            where multiple layers of tape were applied or where adhesive transfer was particularly high.
          description: Adhesive residue on MMCs typically presents as a thin, uneven film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate coatings, often exhibiting streaking patterns due to the tape
            removal process. The residue's appearance changes over time, becoming darker and potentially more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common, with higher concentrations near the edges of the original
            tape application and along the direction of tape removal. The MMC's surface roughness influences the distribution,
            with adhesive tending to accumulate in valleys and crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas where the tape was initially applied. The center of the taped area
            often has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Adhesive tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and surface depressions. Sharp edges may exhibit a 'wicking' effect, drawing adhesive along the edge.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive, especially
            when fresh. Pooling may occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen under direct light, while aged residue tends to be matte.
            The sheen is due to the smooth, relatively uniform surface of the fresh adhesive layer. The matte appearance of
            aged residue is due to increased surface roughness and scattering of light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rougher, more brittle, and sometimes
            powdery surface as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform distribution of adhesive polymers and
            potential debris embedded within.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), small pools in surface depressions, and crust-like
            formations in areas of heavy accumulation. Flaking and cracking are common in aged residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from near-uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        molybdenum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes brittle, harder to remove, and may exhibit discoloration due to oxidation or degradation of the adhesive
            polymers.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin film (within hours). Over days, solvent evaporation leads
            to increased viscosity and tackiness. Over months, oxidation and degradation result in hardening, discoloration,
            and potential for increased adhesion to the molybdenum surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F peru (aged, thicker deposits)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (heavily aged, potentially oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to the adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip
            marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners,
            and within surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even distribution.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) are the most common coverage ranges. Extreme coverage (>85%) is
            rare unless the entire surface was intentionally coated with adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on molybdenum surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film, ranging
            in color from a pale yellow to a brownish-orange. The residue often exhibits irregular coverage, with variations
            in thickness and concentration, influenced by the initial application of the adhesive tape.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, edge deposits, and overall film coverage are common. The specific
            pattern depends heavily on the type of tape and the method of application/removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to squeeze out from
            under the tape. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., scratches, grain boundaries) can trap adhesive residue,
            leading to increased concentration in these areas. Sharp edges tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary
            action.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow and pooling are observed if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid
            state. Vertical streaking may occur during tape removal.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be more matte, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes crusty
            or powdery feel with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with potential for micro-cracking
            and delamination.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick deposits), with occasional
            buildup reaching up to 100 micrometers in localized areas.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), crusts (aged residue), patches (uneven removal),
            and pools (localized accumulation).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with significant variations in
            thickness and concentration across the surface.
        mortar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically pliable and translucent with a strong adhesive tack. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes brittle, opaque, discolored, and loses its tackiness, often incorporating dirt
            and environmental contaminants.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) involves the formation of a thin, sticky film. Over weeks/months,
            the residue dries, hardens, and begins to attract dust and debris. After years, the residue becomes brittle, discolored,
            and deeply embedded with contaminants.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki - fresh residue)'
          - '#DEB887 (BurlyWood - slightly aged)'
          - '#CD853F (Peru - moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 (SaddleBrown - heavily aged, dirt-embedded)'
          - '#A9A9A9 (DarkGray - dust covered)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, linear streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            from adhesive flow, and overall film-like coatings.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in mortar joints, and in surface crevices. Lighter concentrations occur on flat, exposed mortar surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the extent of tape application
            and removal. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in areas with repeated tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on mortar presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to extensive coatings, reflecting the original tape application. The residue
            tends to accumulate in mortar joints and surface irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, linear, film-like, pooled, and edge-concentrated distributions are common.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape area and mortar joints due to capillary action and accumulation
            during tape removal. The center of the tape area often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities and mortar joints act as collection points for adhesive residue, leading
            to increased concentration in these areas. Rough surfaces promote greater adhesion and retention of the residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at lower
            points on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue tends
            to be matte due to surface roughness and accumulated dirt. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference
            effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery
            surface as it ages and attracts dust/debris. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform, amorphous structure
            with embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick, pooled residue), but
            is typically between 10-100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Drip marks, pools of adhesive, thin films, crusts formed by dried adhesive and debris, and distinct
            patches mirroring the original tape shape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        neodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color (towards brown), less sticky, and potentially brittle or powdery. Oxidation of the neodymium
            surface underneath can contribute to a darker, rust-colored appearance around the residue.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited. Over hours/days, the adhesive may flow slightly,
            concentrating at edges and low points. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens and may become more visible as it
            attracts dust and debris. Over years, the residue can degrade, becoming brittle and potentially flaking off, leaving
            behind a stained surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC ivory'
          - '#EEE8AA pale goldenrod'
          - '#D2B48C tan'
          - '#C04000 burnt umber'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown'
          common_patterns: Streaks, localized spots, irregular patches, and a thin film covering the entire surface are common.
            Drip marks may be present on vertically oriented surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating. Areas where the tape was
            torn or cut often exhibit a buildup of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape used, the duration
            of contact, and the cleaning methods employed. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on neodymium surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with
            a yellowish-brown (#D2B48C) or off-white (#F5F5DC) hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a nearly complete
            coating, often exhibiting a streaky or mottled appearance due to uneven application and aging.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated in areas where the tape was initially applied or where it
            has flowed due to gravity or surface tension. Can also be found as a thin, almost invisible film across the entire
            surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas where the tape was initially applied. The center of the tape area
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects. Recessed
            areas and grooves can trap adhesive, leading to thicker deposits.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in vertical streaking
            and pooling at the bottom edge. This effect is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or have a very low gloss. Iridescence is generally not observed unless the residue is extremely thin and
            uniform.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the residue transitions to a more rigid, sometimes brittle,
            and less glossy texture over time. Microscopic examination reveals a slightly uneven surface with small ridges
            and valleys. Aged residue can become powdery or crusty in localized areas.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers)
            possible in areas where the adhesive was applied more heavily or where it has pooled.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts (especially
            with aged residue), and irregular patches are common formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (extremely rare) to highly variable with
            distinct patches and streaks.
        nickel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent and sticky. Over time (weeks to months), it yellows, darkens,
            and becomes brittle, losing its tackiness and potentially cracking or flaking. Oxidation can further darken the
            residue.
          buildup_progression: Initially a thin, even film (hours). Over days, tackiness decreases and dust/debris accumulate.
            Weeks/months lead to yellowing, hardening, and potential cracking. Years result in a brittle, dark, and potentially
            flaking residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#808080 gray (metallic sheen from nickel showing through)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from wiping, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a general film covering
            the affected area. Fingerprints and other surface imperfections can influence the pattern.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial tape application and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on nickel presents as a patchy, often iridescent film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. Coverage varies significantly depending on the adhesive type and removal method, ranging from sparse to heavy.
            Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations often found at the edges of the original tape application
            or in areas where the adhesive was allowed to pool. Streaks are common from wiping attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the adhesive often being thicker at the tape's edges. Center areas may
            have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Recessed areas and corners tend to accumulate
            more residue. Sharp edges can create stress points leading to cracking of aged residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and streaks. On horizontal
            surfaces, gravity leads to pooling and a more even distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be more matte. Iridescence
            can be observed in thin films due to interference effects, especially under angled lighting.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery texture as
            it ages and dries. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and
            tackiness.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches (where the adhesive was unevenly applied or removed).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        niobium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hardened, darker in color, and
            more difficult to remove. It may also exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation, such as cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs within hours of tape application, forming a thin film. Over days, the
            adhesive cures and hardens. Over months, oxidation and degradation lead to darkening, embrittlement, and potential
            flaking. Years of exposure can result in a heavily degraded, difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, newer residue)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderate thickness, some aging)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (aged, oxidized residue)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a general film
            coating. Fingerprints and other handling marks are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape used, the duration of
            application, and the method of removal. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives
            or prolonged exposure.
          description: Adhesive residue on Niobium typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish-brown
            to amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting uneven distribution
            and edge effects. Aged residue darkens and becomes more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape application and
            in areas where the adhesive pooled during application or removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the adhesive spreading outwards from the tape's edge. The center area
            under the tape often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., scratches, grooves) can trap adhesive residue, leading to
            higher concentrations in these areas. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension
            effects.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and a thicker accumulation at the bottom edge of the original tape application. Pooling can occur in low-lying
            areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes more opaque, the sheen
            diminishes, and it takes on a matte appearance. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin, layered residues.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to smooth and glassy as it cures. Over time,
            it becomes brittle, crusty, and may exhibit micro-cracking. Can also be powdery if the adhesive degrades significantly.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas
            of pooling or heavy application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts around the
            edges of the original tape, and patches where the tape was unevenly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly perfectly uniform thin films to highly uneven patches
            and streaks.
        nitinol:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared, exhibiting a light yellow color. Aged residue becomes
            hardened, darker (amber to brown), and more difficult to remove, often cracking and flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is characterized by a thin, sticky film. Over weeks/months, the
            residue hardens and darkens due to oxidation and UV exposure. After years, the residue becomes brittle, cracked,
            and difficult to remove, often incorporating dust and debris.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the tape's removal direction, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and uniform coating where the tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations typically occur at the edges of the original tape application area,
            in corners and crevices, and along the direction of tape removal. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, thinner
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the tape type, application pressure, and removal
            method. Light (10-30%) is common after a single, clean tape removal. Moderate (30-60%) indicates incomplete removal
            or residue buildup.
          description: Adhesive residue on Nitinol typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish-brown
            (amber) hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting streaks and pooling
            depending on the adhesive type and application method.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily contact-based, mirroring the original tape's contact area. Streaks occur from tape
            removal. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces or in crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential for residue
            accumulation during removal. The center tends to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to increased surface area and capillary
            action. Concave surfaces promote pooling, while convex surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive during application and initial setting, resulting
            in drip marks and pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen, while aged residue tends to be matte due to surface
            oxidation and degradation. Iridescence may be observed in very thin layers due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more brittle and crusty texture with age.
            Microscopic examination reveals a generally smooth surface with occasional micro-cracks and particulate inclusions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) in areas
            of pooling or repeated tape application.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in low-lying areas, thin films covering the entire contact
            area, crusts forming on aged residue, and patches where the adhesive has partially detached.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            with significant thickness variations.
        nylon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to tan or brown, becomes less tacky, and may crack or flake. Oxidation and UV exposure
            contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue may spread slightly
            due to tackiness. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens, discolors, and may crack or flake. Dust and debris accumulate,
            further altering the appearance. Years of exposure lead to significant discoloration, embrittlement, and potential
            chemical degradation of the nylon surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0F8FF (almost transparent, fresh)'
          - '#FFFACD (pale yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#E6D8B9 (light tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#D3C1A7 (medium tan, aged)'
          - '#C0A68E (dark tan/brown, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and irregular patches are common. Uniform coatings are rare unless the
            adhesive was intentionally applied as a film. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage are
            rare, usually only occurring in areas where tape was repeatedly applied or heavily concentrated.
          description: Adhesive residue on nylon typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight
            tackiness to a hardened, discolored layer. The residue often exhibits a mottled appearance with variations in
            color and thickness, influenced by the adhesive type and environmental exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, irregular patches, and thin films are common. The distribution
            is often uneven, reflecting the original application of the adhesive tape.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the adhesive being concentrated at the tape's edges. The center of the
            taped area may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and textured areas. Smooth surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more even coating.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen under direct light. Aged residue tends to be
            matte due to surface roughness and dust accumulation. The color appears more saturated under bright light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rubbery or brittle texture with age. Microscopic
            examination may reveal a slightly rough surface with small crystalline structures or powdery deposits, especially
            in aged samples. The surface can also exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, becoming matte as it ages and attracts
            dust.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, irregular patches, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and hardened crusts (in heavily
            aged areas). Small pools of adhesive may form in surface depressions.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, usually exhibiting significant variations in thickness
            and coverage.
        oak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens, becomes less tacky, and may harden or crack, becoming more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial application (0-24 hours) results in a thin, clear film. Over days/weeks, the adhesive
            crosslinks and becomes more visible. Over months/years, it darkens, hardens, and may crack or flake off, leaving
            a persistent stain.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (Fresh, translucent yellowish-white)'
          - '#E6D8B0 (Slightly aged, pale yellow)'
          - '#D1C08A (Moderately aged, light tan)'
          - '#B39765 (Heavily aged, brownish-yellow)'
          - '#8A734D (Severely aged, dark brown)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots or rectangular outlines corresponding to the original tape footprint, streaks from
            wiping or cleaning attempts, and drip marks if solvent-based adhesives were used.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape footprint,
            in corners, and within the grain of the oak. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on the type of tape, duration of adhesion, and cleaning
            attempts. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless multiple layers of tape were applied.
          description: Adhesive residue on oak presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint, covering areas previously adhered to tape. The residue exhibits varying degrees of tackiness and can range
            from a thin, barely visible layer to a thicker, more noticeable buildup, often conforming to the grain of the
            oak.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, edge concentrations, and grain-following streaks are common. Residue
            often accumulates in the pores and grain of the oak.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent drying/curing
            processes. The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas and along edges. Curved surfaces may exhibit uneven
            distribution due to surface tension effects during application.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow is evident with liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling at
            the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and boundaries become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly elastic, transitioning to a more brittle, sometimes powdery or crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with small ridges and valleys corresponding
            to the oak grain.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (barely visible film) to 500 micrometers (thick buildup), with
            an average thickness of 50-150 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in grain depressions, crusts on aged residue,
            and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform patches
            and streaks.
        onyx:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color (yellowing or browning), and less tacky, often attracting dust and becoming brittle.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progresses over time. Initially (hours/days), a thin, translucent film is present.
            Over weeks/months, the residue thickens, darkens, and attracts dust. After years, the residue can become a hardened,
            discolored crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 ivory'
          - '#E6D8B0 pale yellow'
          - '#D4C18F light tan'
          - '#B3976A amber'
          - '#826A47 dark brown'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines mirroring tape dimensions, linear streaks from tape
            removal, and localized spots where adhesive was concentrated. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but thinner, layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape and the
            duration of application. Heavy (>60%) coverage is less common but can occur with aggressive adhesives or prolonged
            application.
          description: Adhesive residue on onyx typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a slight yellow
            or brown tint. The residue tends to concentrate in areas where the tape was initially applied, leaving behind
            distinct patterns mirroring the tape's shape and edges. Over time, the residue can attract dust and dirt, further
            altering its color and texture.
          distribution_patterns: The distribution is generally non-uniform, concentrated in areas where the tape was applied.
            Edges of the tape application area often exhibit a higher concentration of residue.
          edge_center_behavior: Residue often prefers edges of the original tape application area due to adhesive squeeze-out
            and incomplete removal during tape peeling.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and in corners. Raised areas may exhibit less residue due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the pattern on vertical surfaces, leading to downward flow and streaking.
            Pooling may occur at the base of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be matte due to surface degradation and dust accumulation. The onyx underneath may appear duller where residue
            is present.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slightly sticky, the texture evolves to become rougher and potentially powdery
            as the adhesive dries and degrades. Dust and debris accumulation can create a gritty or crusty surface. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the adhesive residue typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach
            up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy accumulation.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions),
            crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation), and patches mirroring the shape of the tape.
          uniformity_assessment: The uniformity is highly variable, ranging from relatively uniform thin films to highly localized
            and concentrated deposits.
        palladium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and relatively clear. Aged residue darkens, hardens, and may crack or
            flake off. Oxidation of the adhesive components contributes to the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue begins to migrate
            and pool slightly. After weeks, oxidation and hardening begin, leading to color changes and embrittlement. After
            months/years, the residue becomes a brittle, dark crust that may crack and flake off.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2E7C6 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E0C890 light amber (slightly aged)'
          - '#C6A363 medium amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#A37A33 dark amber (aged)'
          - '#70521E dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Streaks from tape removal, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, drip marks on vertical
            surfaces, and a general film coating across the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in any surface imperfections (scratches, pits). Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on the tape type, application pressure, and removal technique.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with multiple tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on palladium typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish-brown
            to amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting streaks and pooling
            depending on the adhesive type and application method. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original
            tape application area and in crevices or surface imperfections. Streaks are oriented in the direction of tape
            removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue left
            behind during tape removal. The center area typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and recessed areas. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            a thicker accumulation at the bottom of the affected area. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue becomes matte or exhibits micro-cracking
            that scatters light, reducing gloss. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, slightly tacky surface. Over time, the
            residue becomes brittle, potentially developing a crusty or powdery texture with microscopic cracking. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for thin films to 20-50 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or buildup. Extreme cases with multiple tape applications can reach 100+ micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        peek:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it yellows, hardens, and
            becomes less tacky, potentially developing a brittle or cracked surface. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate
            this process.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, tackiness decreases and dust/debris
            may adhere. After weeks/months, the residue hardens, yellows, and may crack. Years of exposure lead to significant
            oxidation, embrittlement, and potential delamination from the PEEK surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFDD0 (Creamy White - fresh, low tack adhesive)'
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki - slightly aged, acrylic adhesive)'
          - '#DEB887 (BurlyWood - moderately aged, rubber-based adhesive)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna - heavily aged, oxidized adhesive)'
          - '#696969 (DimGray - residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from wiping or incomplete removal, drip
            marks if the adhesive was liquid, and a general film covering the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at the edges of the original tape outline, in corners and crevices,
            and where the tape was initially applied. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) for light residue after cleaning to heavy (60-85%) or extreme (>85%)
            for poorly removed or aged adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on PEEK typically appears as a thin, translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, depending on the adhesive type
            and removal method. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized around the original tape application area. Can spread due to pressure or cleaning
            attempts. Often found concentrated along edges and in surface scratches.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to spread outwards
            from the initial application point. The center of the original tape area may also have higher concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and in any surface imperfections (scratches,
            grooves). Sharp edges may exhibit a buildup of residue due to surface tension effects.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, adhesive residue can exhibit downward flow patterns, resulting in vertical
            streaking and pooling at the bottom of the affected area. Thicker residues are more prone to gravitational effects.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky or tacky, transitioning to a smooth, slightly rough, or even crusty texture with
            age and exposure to air. Some residues may exhibit a powdery surface due to degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, small pools in surface depressions, drip marks on vertical surfaces, crusts around
            the edges of residue patches, and individual adhesive patches corresponding to the original tape pattern.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, even with spray adhesives. Varies with application
            method and removal effectiveness.
        pet:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens to amber or brown, becomes brittle, less tacky, and more difficult to remove. Oxidation
            and UV exposure accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, sticky film. Over weeks, the adhesive begins to dry
            and oxidize, becoming less tacky. After months/years, the residue hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake off,
            forming a brittle crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2F0E6 ivory (fresh, minimal residue)'
          - '#E6D8A2 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B46E amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B78733 dark amber (heavily aged)'
          - '#8A550D dark brown (severely aged, oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Streaks parallel to the tape's original direction, localized spots where the adhesive was concentrated,
            and drip marks if the PET surface was vertical during adhesive degradation.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners or crevices, and in areas where the tape was under higher pressure. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10%): Isolated spots or faint streaks. Light (10-30%): Scattered residue with visible
            PET surface. Moderate (30-60%): Partial coating with significant residue. Heavy (60-85%): Near-complete coating
            with thick residue. Extreme (>85%): Complete coating with very thick, potentially layered residue.'
          description: Adhesive residue on PET typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a faint yellowish
            tint to a more pronounced amber hue. Coverage varies from sparse, localized spots to a more uniform coating, often
            exhibiting streaking patterns related to the original tape application.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks, spots, edges of previous tape application, areas where tape was creased or folded,
            and areas exposed to higher temperatures or UV light.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and stress concentration during tape removal.
            The center of the taped area may have a thinner, more uniform residue layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more
            residue due to capillary action and increased surface area. Textured surfaces provide more sites for adhesive
            to adhere to.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking.
            On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes pooling and a more even distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced
            reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more brittle, crusty, or powdery
            consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness,
            potentially including crystalline structures depending on the adhesive composition.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (due to
            drying and oxidation), and patches (where the adhesive was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            with significant thickness variations.
        phenolic resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Aged residue darkens to brown or even
            black, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or crazing. It also tends to attract and trap dirt and particulate
            matter, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (0-24 hours): Thin, clear, sticky film. Days 1-7: Slight yellowing, increased
            tackiness. Weeks 1-4: Gradual darkening, loss of tackiness, increased brittleness. Months 1+: Significant darkening,
            cracking, dirt accumulation, potential for complete degradation and flaking.'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (residue with embedded dirt/particulates)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from wiping or cleaning attempts, drip
            marks if the adhesive was liquid or semi-liquid, and uniform coating if the adhesive was spread evenly.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            area, in corners and crevices, and along surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform
            layers.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage is
            rare, usually only occurring in cases of severe adhesive application or poor removal techniques.
          description: Adhesive residue on phenolic resin composites typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film,
            often with a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced
            by the adhesive type and removal method. Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Edge-biased distribution is common due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Localized
            spots correspond to the original tape contact points. Streaks result from wiping or solvent application. Crevices
            and surface imperfections tend to accumulate more residue.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and difficulty in cleaning edges thoroughly. The
            center of the taped area may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Recessed areas and corners act as collection
            points, while raised areas may have less residue due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid or semi-liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and
            pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. As it ages
            and becomes more matte, the sheen diminishes. Embedded dirt can further reduce reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a smooth, glassy surface as the
            volatile components evaporate. With age and oxidation, it can become brittle, crusty, and prone to cracking, exhibiting
            a slightly rough feel. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (in low-lying areas), crusts (aged, brittle
            residue), and patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly localized and
            uneven deposits.
        pine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and very sticky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to brown or gray, hardens, and becomes less tacky, often attracting dust and debris.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (0-24 hours). Over days/weeks, the adhesive may
            migrate and pool slightly. Over months/years, the residue hardens, darkens, and attracts dust, increasing its
            visibility and thickness.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, dirt accumulation)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (with embedded dust/debris)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if
            the adhesive was applied in liquid form, and a general film covering the taped area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at the edges of the original tape application, in corners, and
            within crevices of the wood grain. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape and the duration of application.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with extensive tape use.
          description: Adhesive residue on pine presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape application.
            The residue tends to accumulate in the wood grain and around knots.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Concentrated along edges of the taped
            area and within the wood grain. Can also be found in small, isolated spots where adhesive transferred during tape
            removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Center areas typically
            have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in depressions, grooves, and around knots due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Edges and corners also exhibit higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow is evident in drip marks and pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical
            streaking can occur during tape removal.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte, especially
            if it has accumulated dust. The sheen can vary depending on the type of adhesive used.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a hardened, smooth or slightly rough surface
            as it ages. May exhibit a crystalline or powdery texture in areas where the adhesive has degraded. Can also be
            crusty if exposed to environmental contaminants.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Average
            thickness is around 50-150 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), small pools in depressions, hardened crusts
            on the surface, and patches of residue corresponding to tape contact points.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (thin, even film) to highly variable (thick
            pools and sparse spots).
        plaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared, exhibiting a slight sheen. Aged residue becomes brittle,
            discolored, and more difficult to remove, often developing a matte finish and a network of micro-cracks.
          buildup_progression: Initially a thin, uniform film (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation leads to increased viscosity
            and tackiness. Over weeks/months, oxidation, UV exposure, and dust accumulation cause discoloration, embrittlement,
            and increased adhesion to the plaster. Years result in hardened, discolored crusts that are extremely difficult
            to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F5DEB3 wheat (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#BC8F8F rosy brown (heavily aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (oxidized/heat-affected)'
          common_patterns: Rectangular outlines corresponding to tape dimensions, irregular patches, streaks from tape removal,
            and drip marks if adhesive was applied in liquid form.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often found at the edges of the original tape application, in corners,
            and in crevices of the plaster surface. Lighter concentrations occur in the center of the tape area or where cleaning
            has been attempted.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the size and number of tape applications. Light (10-30%)
            is common for single tape applications, while moderate (30-60%) and heavy (60-85%) occur with multiple layers
            or wider tape.
          description: Adhesive residue on plaster presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, reflecting the original tape pattern. Color
            variations and texture changes occur with age and environmental exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where tape was applied, often with distinct edges and corners. Can also
            spread due to cleaning attempts or environmental factors.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive bleed-out during tape application and subsequent drying.
            Center areas may have lower concentrations due to tape stretching or uneven adhesive distribution.
          geometry_effects: Adhesive tends to accumulate in concave areas and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Rough plaster surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward flow and streaking, especially with liquid adhesives. Horizontal
            surfaces may exhibit pooling and more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen under direct light. Aged residue typically appears
            matte and can exhibit subtle iridescence due to surface cracking and oxidation.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, powdery, or crusty texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with embedded plaster particles and potential crystalline
            structures from adhesive degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or multiple tape applications.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in surface imperfections, crusts formed by
            adhesive degradation, and patches of varying thickness and opacity.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches with
            varying thickness and concentration.
        platinum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically soft, pliable, and translucent. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes harder, more brittle, and often darkens in color due to oxidation and environmental interactions. Cracking
            and flaking may also occur.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), dust and debris accumulate,
            increasing the thickness and altering the texture. After months/years, oxidation and environmental interactions
            lead to discoloration, hardening, and potential cracking of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F peru (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), and a general film
            coating are common. Fingerprints and other surface contaminants can influence the residue's distribution.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial tape application and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on platinum typically appears as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse speckles to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting irregular patterns
            and edge buildup. The residue's color and texture change with age and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated along edges, corners, and areas where the adhesive was initially
            applied. Streaks and patterns are common due to the method of tape removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency of adhesives to spread
            outwards from the initial point of contact. The center of the taped area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges. Sharp corners and crevices act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more even distribution, but pooling can still
            occur in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light specularly. As it ages and becomes
            more matte, the reflection becomes more diffuse. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and thickness
            variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes powdery
            or crusty surface as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach several hundred micrometers in areas of
            heavy buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts in areas
            of heavy buildup, and patches where the adhesive was unevenly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare) to extremely non-uniform depending
            on the application method and surface conditions.
        plywood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellowish, pliable, and highly adhesive.
            Aged residue (months/years) darkens, hardens, becomes brittle, and loses its tackiness, often developing cracks
            and discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited upon tape removal (hours). Over days, the residue
            may spread slightly due to temperature and pressure. Over months, oxidation and degradation occur, leading to
            discoloration, hardening, and potential cracking. Years of exposure can result in a brittle, powdery residue that
            is easily removed.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (burnt/heat-affected)'
          common_patterns: Rectangular outlines, linear streaks, and localized spots corresponding to the original tape application.
            Residue often exhibits a 'halo' effect around the edges of the original tape footprint, where adhesive spread
            beyond the tape's boundaries.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            footprint, as well as in crevices and surface imperfections of the plywood. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape and application
            method. Heavy coverage (60-85%) is rare, typically occurring only in areas of repeated tape application or excessive
            adhesive transfer.
          description: Adhesive residue on plywood presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint, distributed unevenly across the surface. The residue typically follows the pattern of the original adhesive
            tape, leaving behind distinct rectangular or linear marks with varying degrees of coverage and color intensity.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was previously applied. Can also spread
            beyond the original tape boundaries due to pressure and temperature variations.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape application area, with a tendency for slightly less residue
            in the center of the taped area.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry influences the distribution of residue, with more residue accumulating in depressions,
            grooves, and along edges. Sharp corners and edges tend to concentrate adhesive due to capillary action.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can cause adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in vertical streaking
            and pooling at the bottom edge of the tape footprint. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform distribution, with
            potential for pooling in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light more readily. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced light reflection. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture
            become more pronounced.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with potential for
            a slightly rough or uneven surface due to dust and debris accumulation. Aged residue can become brittle and powdery,
            exhibiting a crystalline appearance under magnification (100x).
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with localized buildup reaching up to 100 micrometers
            in areas of heavy adhesive concentration.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if applied vertically), and crusts (in areas of heavy
            buildup and degradation). Microscopic formations may include crystalline structures and particulate matter embedded
            within the residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly concentrated spots and
            streaks. Uniformity depends on the type of tape, application pressure, and environmental conditions.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellowish and highly tacky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens to brown or even gray, becomes brittle, and loses its tackiness, often cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is present. Over days, volatile components evaporate, increasing
            viscosity and tackiness. Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration, embrittlement, and
            increased adhesion to the polycarbonate. Dust and dirt accumulation further alter the appearance over longer timeframes
            (years).
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (contaminated with dust/dirt)'
          common_patterns: Streaks from tape removal, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, drip marks if the adhesive
            was applied in liquid form, and a general hazy film across the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape area, in
            corners, and within surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, application
            method, and removal technique. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on polycarbonate typically presents as a hazy, translucent film with a yellowish or
            brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting streaks and localized
            buildup. The residue's color and texture change significantly with age and exposure to environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape application area
            and around any surface imperfections. Streaks are common, indicating the direction of tape removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to adhesive squeeze-out and difficulty in complete removal from
            these areas. The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in recessed
            areas, along edges, and around protrusions. Complex geometries lead to more uneven distribution.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in pooling at the bottom of vertical
            surfaces and vertical streaking. This effect is more pronounced with freshly applied adhesive.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a dry, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness, depending on
            the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations in localized areas. Average
            thickness is typically between 5 and 20 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), crusts (in aged residue), patches of varying
            thickness, and localized pools of adhesive.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant variations
            in thickness and concentration across the surface.
        polyester resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent and pliable. Over time, it becomes more opaque, brittle,
            and discolored, often exhibiting a darker, brownish hue due to oxidation and degradation. Cracking and flaking
            may also occur.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial deposition (hours): Thin, uniform film. Days: Slight tackiness, potential for dust
            accumulation. Weeks: Yellowing, increased opacity. Months: Hardening, discoloration, potential cracking. Years:
            Brittle, dark coloration, significant degradation and potential delamination from the composite surface.'

          - '#BC8F8F ''RosyBrown'' (aged, months, slight oxidation)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, years, significant oxidation)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied in liquid form),
            and a general film-like coating. Residue often concentrates around the edges of where the adhesive tape was originally
            applied.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges and corners of the original
            tape application area, as well as in any surface crevices or imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of adhesive, application method, and removal
            process. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in cases of severe contamination.
          description: Adhesive residue on polyester resin composites typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque
            film with a yellowish-brown or off-white coloration. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a more uniform coating,
            often exhibiting a slightly tacky or glossy surface. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Edge accumulation, corner buildup, uniform film, localized spots, tape outline replication.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to squeeze out from under
            the tape during application. The center area typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges, while convex surfaces may have a thinner coating due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state, gravity will cause downward flow
            and pooling, resulting in vertical streaking and thicker accumulations at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and variations in thickness become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slightly tacky, transitioning to a rougher, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age and exposure to environmental factors. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying
            degrees of adhesion to the composite substrate.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) possible
            in areas where the adhesive was heavily applied or pooled.

            (aged residue), and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare) to highly non-uniform depending on
            the application method and removal process of the adhesive.
        polyethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes darker (yellowish-brown to dark brown), brittle, less sticky, and may exhibit cracking
            or flaking. Dirt and debris often become embedded in the aged residue.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial buildup (hours): thin, even film. Days: slight thickening at edges. Weeks: noticeable
            discoloration and increased thickness. Months: hardening, cracking, and dirt accumulation. Years: significant
            degradation, embrittlement, and potential for complete removal (leaving behind a faint stain).'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'

          - '#696969 DimGray (dirt-embedded, heavily degraded)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include outlines of the original tape, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated,
            streaks from tape removal, and drip marks if the polyethylene surface was vertical.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape, in corners
            or crevices, and where the tape was initially applied with greater pressure. Lighter concentrations are found
            on flat surfaces away from the tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10%): scattered spots; Light (10-30%): partial tape outline; Moderate (30-60%): significant
            tape outline with some infill; Heavy (60-85%): near-complete tape outline with substantial infill; Extreme (>85%):
            almost complete coverage.'
          description: Adhesive residue on polyethylene presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or
            brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, reflecting the original tape pattern.
            The residue tends to be sticky initially, becoming more brittle and discolored with age.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, tape outlines, streaks, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and uniform thin
            films are common. Distribution is heavily influenced by the original tape application and removal process.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges initially due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Over time, the
            center may become more uniformly covered due to smearing or spreading.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in crevices,
            corners, and along edges. Raised surfaces may have less residue due to abrasion or cleaning.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and streaks. On horizontal
            surfaces, gravity leads to pooling and more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery texture as
            it ages and degrades. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and cracking.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, concentrated areas). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 100 micrometers.

            residue), and patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, thin films) to highly variable (thick,
            uneven deposits).
        polyimide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or even black, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate
            degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited. Over hours/days, solvent evaporation and adhesive
            crosslinking occur. Over weeks/months, oxidation, UV degradation, and dust accumulation lead to discoloration
            and increased thickness, especially at edges and in crevices. After years, the residue becomes brittle and may
            crack or flake off.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'

            in liquid form, and halo effects around the edges of the original adhesive application.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the adhesive type, application method, and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common after tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on polyimide appears as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive type and application
            method. The residue tends to accumulate along edges and in surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily follows the original adhesive application pattern. Concentrated at tape edges,
            around cutouts, and in areas where the adhesive was applied unevenly. Can also spread due to capillary action
            or solvent evaporation.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and capillary action. The center of the original
            adhesive area may have a more uniform, but thinner, layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and in any surface imperfections. Sharp edges
            may exhibit a higher concentration due to capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces
            and vertical streaking. Can also cause uneven distribution on inclined surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Iridescence
            may be observed in very thin layers due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with age. May exhibit
            a slightly rough or uneven surface due to adhesive application or degradation. Can become powdery or crusty with
            extreme aging and environmental exposure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm to 50 μm, but can reach up to 100 μm in areas of heavy buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, thin films covering the
            surface, crusts formed by dried adhesive, and patches where the adhesive has partially detached.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform under a well-applied tape to highly non-uniform
            with streaks, spots, and pooling.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is generally clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens to a brownish or yellowish-brown, becomes brittle, less tacky, and more difficult
            to remove. It may also exhibit cracking or crazing.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (0-24 hours). Over days, the adhesive may migrate
            and pool slightly. Over weeks/months, oxidation and degradation lead to darkening, embrittlement, and increased
            difficulty in removal. Dust and debris accumulate, further altering the appearance.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3D5A4 desert sand (moderately aged)'
          - '#CDB38B dark khaki (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (burnt, heat-aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from wiping or attempted removal, drip
            marks if the adhesive was liquid, and a general film coating across the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges of the original tape application, in corners and crevices
            of textured surfaces, and along drip lines. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) is most common. Extreme (>85%) is possible with intentional adhesive
            application.
          description: Adhesive residue on polypropylene typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a
            yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive
            type and removal method. The residue tends to accumulate in textured areas and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform film, edge accumulation, and pooling in textured areas.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and textured areas over the center of flat surfaces. Edges of the original tape
            application show the highest concentration.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas, along edges, and on textured surfaces due to increased
            surface area and capillary action. Sharp corners and edges often exhibit higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Liquid adhesives will exhibit downward flow and pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical
            streaking is common with liquid or semi-liquid residues.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte due to surface oxidation and degradation. The residue can appear more visible under oblique
            lighting.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more brittle, sometimes powdery or crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and
            roughness depending on the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in depressions, crusts on aged residue, and
            patches where the adhesive was unevenly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, after intentional coating) to highly
            variable (typical, after tape removal).
        polystyrene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear and highly tacky, easily attracting dust and debris. Aged residue
            becomes more opaque, yellowed or browned, less tacky, and may crack or flake off. It can also become harder to
            remove.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape application. Over hours/days, the adhesive flows
            and spreads slightly. Over weeks/months, oxidation and environmental factors cause discoloration and hardening.
            Over years, the residue becomes brittle and may crack or flake off.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFFF translucent-clear (fresh)'
          - '#FFFACD lemon-chiffon (slightly aged)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#EEDC82 light-goldenrod-yellow (aged)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and uniform coating (if tape was
            fully adhered). Fingerprints and other surface contaminants may be embedded within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often occur at the edges of the original tape, in corners, and
            in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%), light (10-30%), moderate (30-60%), heavy (60-85%), extreme (>85%) - depending on
            the initial tape coverage and removal effectiveness.
          description: Adhesive residue on polystyrene typically presents as a translucent to yellowish film, often with irregular
            edges and varying degrees of tackiness. The residue's color and texture change over time due to oxidation and
            environmental factors, transitioning from a clear, slightly sticky film to a more opaque, brittle, and potentially
            discolored layer. Coverage can range from sparse spots to a nearly complete coating, depending on the adhesive
            type and removal method.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, streaky, uniform film, edge accumulation, and patterns mirroring the original tape
            application.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue
            accumulation during removal. The center may have a more uniform, thinner layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners and along edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Textured surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulations
            at the bottom. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and sticky, transitioning to rough, brittle, and potentially powdery or crusty
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures depending on the adhesive composition.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (where tape was partially removed).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare) to highly variable depending on the
            application and removal process.
        polytetrafluoroethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is a translucent or pale yellow film. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens to
            a yellowish-brown and becomes more brittle, developing cracks and potentially flaking off. Heavily aged residue
            can appear almost black due to oxidation and carbonization.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue begins to concentrate
            at edges and corners. After weeks to months, the residue darkens, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off.
            Years of exposure can lead to significant carbonization and hardening of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E0D1A6 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#C8B486 yellowish-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#A38B64 dark brown (heavily aged)'
          - '#80643F dark, almost black (carbonized/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and edge/corner accumulation are
            common. Residue often conforms to the texture of the original adhesive tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even distribution.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare and usually indicates
            excessive adhesive application or prolonged contact.
          description: Adhesive residue on PTFE typically presents as a thin, uneven film with a yellowish-brown (#C8B486)
            discoloration. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to moderate patches, often concentrated along edges and corners
            due to surface tension and capillary action. The residue's appearance changes from a slightly tacky film to a
            brittle, cracked layer over time.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated at edges, corners, and along the original tape's boundaries.
            Can also appear as isolated spots or streaks where the adhesive made contact.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects. The center of a flat surface typically
            has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote residue accumulation due to increased surface area and capillary
            forces. Surface roughness can also trap residue, leading to localized buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive residue, resulting
            in thicker deposits at the bottom. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracks become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially slightly tacky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery or
            crusty texture as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a network of cracks and fissures in aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (corresponding to the original tape's contact area).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films (rare) to highly
            localized and uneven deposits.
        polyvinyl chloride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically soft, pliable, and more transparent. Over time (months/years), it hardens,
            darkens in color due to oxidation and UV exposure, and becomes more difficult to remove. It may also attract and
            trap dirt and debris, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial residue (hours/days): Thin, sticky, translucent film. Intermediate (weeks/months):
            Hardening, slight discoloration, increased tackiness. Long-term (months/years): Darkening, embrittlement, dirt
            accumulation, potential for cracking and flaking.'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 wheat (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue with embedded dirt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, outlines of the original tape, drip marks (if applied vertically), and
            a general film covering the affected area. Often exhibits a 'ghosting' effect where the tape was originally placed.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentration at the edges and corners of the original tape placement. Lighter
            concentration in the center of the taped area. Crevices and textured surfaces tend to accumulate more residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application, and removal. Extreme
            coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with repeated tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on PVC presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent
            to opaque. The color varies based on adhesive type and age, typically appearing as yellowish or brownish stains
            with irregular coverage patterns, often concentrated at the edges of the original tape.
          distribution_patterns: Outlines of the original tape, concentrated at the edges where the adhesive was most heavily
            applied, and potentially spread unevenly during removal. Can also appear as isolated spots or streaks where adhesive
            was transferred.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to higher adhesive concentration at the tape's edges. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, grooves, and other surface irregularities. Edges and raised
            areas may exhibit a higher concentration due to the 'edge effect' during tape application and removal.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. On horizontal surfaces, it can lead to pooling and uneven distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit a slight gloss or sheen, while aged residue tends to be more matte.
            The presence of embedded dirt can further reduce gloss. Under oblique lighting, the uneven texture becomes more
            apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a hardened, sometimes brittle or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness, depending on
            the adhesive type and cleaning attempts. Can be smooth if a thin, even layer, or rough if thick and uneven.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, built-up residue).
            In extreme cases, where multiple layers of tape have been applied and removed, the thickness can reach up to 200
            micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools (on horizontal surfaces), hardened
            crusts (with age), and irregular patches. The formation depends on the adhesive's viscosity and the orientation
            of the PVC surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform. Ranges from sparse, isolated patches to a nearly
            continuous film, depending on the tape type, application method, and removal process.
        poplar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens, hardens, and may become brittle, attracting dust and dirt, leading to further discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited. Over time (days/weeks), the adhesive may migrate
            and accumulate at edges and in pores. With prolonged exposure (months/years), the residue hardens, darkens, and
            attracts dirt, leading to a thicker, more visible layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, darkened)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (extreme aging, potential contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks following the direction of tape removal,
            and drip marks if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. Residue often outlines the original shape of the tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentration at the edges of the original tape application, in corners and crevices,
            and along grain lines. Lighter concentration on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape and the duration of application.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged exposure and multiple tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on poplar presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, reflecting the original tape application. The
            residue tends to accumulate in pores and along grain lines of the wood.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, outlines of tape, pooling in low areas, and accumulation along
            grain lines.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape application due to adhesive squeeze-out and higher contact
            pressure. The center area may have a more uniform, thinner layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and around raised features. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or dull due
            to surface oxidation and dust accumulation. The sheen is more pronounced under oblique lighting.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a hardened, smooth, or slightly rough surface
            depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly crystalline
            or amorphous structure. Aged residue can become brittle and powdery.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in depressions, crusts in areas of heavy
            accumulation, and patches corresponding to tape contact points.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches and
            streaks.
        porcelain:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens, hardens, becomes less tacky, and may attract dirt and debris, resulting in a dull,
            discolored appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time: 1. Initial adhesion (minutes/hours): Thin, clear film. 2. Adhesive
            transfer (hours/days): Visible residue pattern. 3. Dirt accumulation (days/weeks): Discoloration and increased
            visibility. 4. Hardening and oxidation (weeks/months): Texture change and darkening. 5. Degradation and cracking
            (months/years): Further discoloration and potential for flaking.'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F5DEB3 Wheat (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#E9D6A7 Pale Goldenrod (moderate aging, slight oxidation)'
          - '#D2B48C Tan (significant aging, dirt accumulation)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, potentially mold growth)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines mirroring the original tape, streaks from adhesive
            transfer during removal, and localized spots where adhesive was concentrated.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, thinner layer.
          coverage_ranges: 'Coverage ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - faint outline; Moderate (30-60%)
            - partial coverage with visible residue; Heavy (60-85%) - significant coverage, obscuring the original surface;
            Extreme (>85%) - almost complete coverage with thick residue layer.'
          description: Adhesive residue on porcelain typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to extensive coatings, reflecting the original tape pattern.
            The residue's color and texture change with age and exposure to environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: 'Distribution patterns include: 1. Outline mirroring the original tape. 2. Random spots and
            streaks. 3. Uniform thin film across the taped area. 4. Concentrated buildup at the edges of the tape.'
          edge_center_behavior: Residue often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential
            for greater adhesive transfer during removal. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Recessed areas and corners tend to accumulate
            more residue. Textured surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to increased residue retention.
          gravity_influence: Gravity affects the pattern on vertical surfaces, causing downward flow and streaking. On horizontal
            surfaces, gravity leads to pooling and even distribution within the taped area.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte due to surface
            oxidation and accumulation of particulate matter. The presence of crystalline structures (rare) can cause iridescence.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, the texture evolves to become less tacky, potentially hardening and
            becoming rough or crusty with age. Dust and debris often adhere to the residue, further altering the texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Heavily
            built-up areas can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films. 2. Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 3. Pools (on
            horizontal surfaces). 4. Crusts (aged, hardened residue). 5. Patches (uneven distribution).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity ranges from perfectly uniform (thin film) to highly variable (uneven streaks and
            pools).
        porphyry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens, hardens, becomes brittle, and is more difficult to remove. Oxidation and UV exposure
            contribute to color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial application (minutes/hours) results in a thin, tacky film. Within days, the adhesive
            begins to dry and harden. Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and embrittlement.
            After years, the residue becomes deeply ingrained in the porphyry surface and extremely difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 ivory (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B474 light amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B38B4D amber (aged)'
          - '#80643A dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, outlines of tape edges, streaks from adhesive removal, drip marks if applied vertically,
            and overall film-like coatings.
          concentration_variations: Higher concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive material,
            in crevices or surface irregularities, and in areas where cleaning efforts have redistributed the residue. Lower
            concentrations are found in the center of the original adhesive area or on smooth, flat surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is rare and usually
            indicates a deliberate application of adhesive over a large area. Extreme (>85%) coverage is unlikely unless the
            entire surface was intentionally coated.
          description: Adhesive residue on porphyry manifests as a thin, often irregular film, ranging from translucent to
            opaque. The color varies from a light amber to a dark, almost brownish hue, depending on age and adhesive type.
            Coverage patterns are typically localized and follow the shape of the original adhesive material.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape or labels were previously applied. Can also
            spread due to cleaning attempts, resulting in a wider, thinner distribution.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and accumulation during application. The center
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and porosity of the porphyry significantly influence adhesive distribution.
            Residue tends to accumulate in pores and crevices, making removal more difficult. Edges and corners of the porphyry
            are also prone to higher concentrations of residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            streaks. Pooling may occur at the base of vertical surfaces or in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte
            or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture evolves to become less tacky and more crusty
            or powdery with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and porphyry surface texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers for thin films, and up to 200 micrometers for thicker,
            pooled areas or crusts.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (from dried adhesive),
            and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Within a localized area, the residue may be relatively uniform, but overall,
            the distribution is non-uniform due to the nature of adhesive application and removal.
        praseodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation of the Praseodymium surface
            underneath can exacerbate the discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initial application results in a thin film. Over time (days/weeks), dust and debris accumulate,
            increasing the thickness and discoloration. After months/years, the residue degrades, becoming brittle and potentially
            flaking off, leaving behind a discolored stain on the Praseodymium surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#EEE8AA pale goldenrod (slightly aged)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (severely aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular streaks, edge accumulation, and overall film-like coating are common.
            Fingerprint patterns may be visible if the adhesive was applied with direct contact. Drip marks can occur on vertical
            surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and in surface crevices due to capillary action
            and surface tension. Lighter concentration on flat, exposed surfaces. Residue tends to pool in low-lying areas.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on the initial application and subsequent cleaning attempts.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the adhesive was intentionally applied as a coating.
          description: Adhesive residue on Praseodymium typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a
            faint yellow to a brownish hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a near-uniform coating, often exhibiting
            irregular edges and varying thickness. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, edge accumulation, overall film-like coating, fingerprint patterns,
            drip marks.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to capillary action and surface tension effects. Center coverage depends
            on the application method; it can be uniform or patchy.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote residue accumulation due to increased surface area and capillary
            forces. Concave surfaces tend to trap residue more effectively than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence is not typically observed unless the residue is extremely
            thin and uniform.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes powdery
            or crusty feel with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. The surface can
            feel slightly rough due to uneven distribution and potential degradation products.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (sparse, almost invisible layer) to 50 micrometers (thick, visible
            accumulation). Average thickness is typically between 5 and 20 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age and
            degradation), and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, only with specialized application techniques)
            to highly variable (most common, due to uneven application and surface irregularities).
        ptfe:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes brittle, harder to remove, and
            may darken in color due to oxidation and UV exposure. Cracking and flaking may occur.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even layer (hours). Over days, the adhesive may migrate
            and concentrate at edges. After weeks/months, oxidation and degradation begin, leading to color changes and embrittlement.
            Years of exposure result in a hardened, discolored, and difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, aged a few days)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderate thickness, aged weeks)'
          - '#CD853F ''Peru'' (thick, aged months, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded, years)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a thin, almost
            invisible film across the entire contact area of the tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges of the tape contact area, corners, and in any surface
            imperfections or crevices. Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth PTFE surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common after tape removal. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is
            possible if the tape was heavily loaded with adhesive or left on for an extended period. Extreme (>85%) is rare
            on PTFE.
          description: Adhesive residue on PTFE typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film, ranging in color
            from pale yellow to brownish-orange. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting
            uneven distribution due to PTFE's low surface energy.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform due to PTFE's low surface energy. Adhesive tends to bead up or spread unevenly.
            Removal often leaves behind a patchy distribution.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to capillary action and the tendency of adhesive to spread outwards from
            the tape's center. The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action. Concave surfaces
            may trap adhesive, leading to thicker deposits.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, adhesive will flow downward, creating drip marks and a thicker accumulation
            at the bottom edge of the tape contact area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, subtle variations in thickness become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a dry, sometimes crusty or powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly rough surface due to adhesive polymer chains.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) at edges
            or where adhesive pooled.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts around edges
            of residue, and scattered patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, even with careful application. Thickness variations
            are common.
        pyrex:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) becomes darker (yellow to brown), harder, less tacky, and more difficult to remove. Oxidation
            and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, even layer. Over days/weeks, the adhesive can migrate
            and accumulate at edges. Over months/years, the residue hardens, discolors, and becomes more difficult to remove,
            with potential for further buildup from dust and environmental contaminants.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFFF (Clear/Transparent - Fresh)'
          - '#FAFAD2 (Light Yellow/Cream - Slight Aging)'
          - '#E6D19C (Yellowish-Tan - Moderate Aging)'
          - '#C2B280 (Tan/Beige - Significant Aging)'
          - '#8B4513 (Brown - Extreme Aging/Oxidation)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks
            if solvent was used for removal. A common pattern is a rectangular outline mirroring the original tape dimensions.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            area, in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application,
            and removal method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged exposure and multiple tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on Pyrex typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight
            tackiness to a hardened, discolored layer. The residue often exhibits a mottled appearance with varying degrees
            of coverage, frequently concentrated at the edges or in areas where the tape was initially applied. Dominant colors
            range from a clear or slightly yellowed (#F0E68C) to a brownish hue (#A0785A) with age.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, spotty residue where adhesive contacted the surface, streaks from tape
            removal, and pooling in corners or crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and accumulation during tape application.
            The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Curved surfaces may exhibit streaking or uneven distribution due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially when wet. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become
            more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and occasional crystalline
            structures depending on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, built-up layers). In extreme
            cases, localized buildup can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if solvents were used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts formed by hardened
            adhesive, and patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly variable, patchy
            distributions with significant thickness variations.
        quartz glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hardened, discolored (darker),
            and more difficult to remove, often flaking or chipping upon disturbance. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute
            to degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, volatile components evaporate,
            increasing viscosity and tackiness. Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure lead to hardening, discoloration,
            and embrittlement. Years of exposure result in a brittle, cracked, and difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#B8860B ''DarkGoldenrod'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 ''DimGray'' (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks from adhesive flow, and uniform coatings
            where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of where the tape was applied, in
            corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but thinner, layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - scattered spots; Light (10-30%) - faint streaks and patches; Moderate (30-60%)
            - noticeable film with some bare areas; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coverage with variations in thickness;
            Extreme (>85%) - thick, uneven coating with significant pooling.
          description: Adhesive residue on quartz glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often exhibiting
            a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the adhesive
            type and application method. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks, spots, uniform films, edge accumulation, and patterns mirroring the original tape
            application.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. Center regions may
            have a more uniform, thinner coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave
            areas and along edges. Sharp corners can act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            a thicker accumulation at the bottom edge. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue typically appears matte or dull.
            Interference fringes (iridescence) can be observed in very thin films due to light interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a network of fine cracks and fissures in aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Extreme
            cases with multiple layers can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (vertical surfaces), pools (horizontal surfaces), crusts (at edges of
            pools), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            of residue.
        quartzite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically more translucent and sticky. Over time (months/years), it yellows, hardens,
            and may become brittle, exhibiting cracking or flaking. Oxidation can lead to darkening and increased visibility.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even layer (hours). Over days, slight spreading and tackiness
            decrease. After weeks, hardening and yellowing begin. Months/years lead to embrittlement, cracking, and potential
            discoloration due to oxidation and environmental factors.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki) - Fresh residue, light acrylic adhesive'
          - '#E3DAC9 (Almond) - Aged residue, acrylic adhesive'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan) - Aged residue, rubber-based adhesive'
          - '#C04000 (Mahogany) - Oxidized rubber-based adhesive, aged'
          - '#FFFFFF (White) - Residue from some masking tapes'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and defined rectangular or linear patterns corresponding to the original
            tape application. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces. Residue often accumulates along the edges of
            the original tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of the original tape application,
            in crevices or surface imperfections, and in areas where the tape was overlapped. Lighter concentrations are found
            in the center of the taped area.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) coverage is rare and typically
            only occurs in areas of repeated tape application or excessive adhesive transfer. Extreme (>85%) is almost never
            seen.
          description: Adhesive residue on quartzite presents as a thin, often translucent or slightly yellowed film, sometimes
            with distinct edges corresponding to the original tape. Coverage varies from sparse to moderate, with color variations
            depending on the adhesive type and age. The residue often exhibits a slightly sticky or tacky feel.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was previously applied. Can also spread slightly
            beyond the original tape boundaries due to adhesive flow or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue accumulation
            during removal. The center area often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and within surface irregularities. On textured
            quartzite, the residue may preferentially adhere to raised areas or fill in depressions.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and
            increased residue concentration at the bottom edge of the taped area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte. The residue can alter the quartzite's natural light reflection properties, creating visible
            contrast.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, transitioning to a more rigid, sometimes powdery or crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. Surface roughness depends
            on the quartzite's inherent texture and the adhesive's interaction with it.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in surface depressions, crusts (aged
            residue), and distinct patches mirroring the shape of the original tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Within a defined area, the residue may be relatively uniform, but overall,
            the distribution across the quartzite surface is non-uniform due to the nature of tape application.
        redwood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Over time (months/years), it darkens
            to a brownish hue, hardens, and may become brittle, exhibiting cracking or flaking. Oxidation and interaction
            with redwood tannins contribute to color change.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible layer. Over days, dust and debris adhere
            to the tacky surface, making it more visible. Over months/years, oxidation, UV exposure, and interaction with
            redwood tannins cause darkening, hardening, and potential cracking/flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, moderate layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 SaddleBrown (residue mixed with redwood tannins)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, and a generally
            uneven coating. Residue often fills the grain of the redwood, creating a textured surface.
          concentration_variations: Higher concentration at edges of the original tape footprint, in redwood grain crevices,
            and in areas where the tape was applied with greater pressure. Lower concentration on flat, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on the tape type, application, and removal process. Extreme
            coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or multiple tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on redwood presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to near-complete coating, influenced by the tape's original application
            and removal method. The residue tends to accumulate in redwood's porous grain.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, grain filling, and overall film coating are common. Distribution
            is heavily influenced by the original tape application and removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape application area due to adhesive squeeze-out and residue
            accumulation during removal. The center may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas, such as grain lines and imperfections in the redwood
            surface. Edges and corners of the original tape application area often exhibit higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Minimal influence on solid adhesive residue. Liquid adhesives, if present during application,
            may exhibit downward flow and pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue typically has a matte finish.
            Under oblique lighting, the uneven surface texture becomes more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a hardened, smooth or slightly rough surface
            as it ages. May exhibit a crystalline or powdery texture in areas of high concentration or after prolonged exposure
            to UV light.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks (if adhesive was liquid), and crusts (in heavily aged
            areas). Grain filling is a very common formation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare, after careful application) to highly
            variable (common, due to uneven tape application and removal).
        rhenium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellowish and pliable. Aged residue darkens to brown or
            even black, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Particulate matter from the environment can become embedded,
            further altering the color and texture.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin film is deposited (hours). Over days, the solvent evaporates, and the residue
            hardens. Over weeks to months, the residue darkens and becomes more brittle. Over years, it can degrade, crack,
            and accumulate particulate matter, forming a crusty or powdery layer.

          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B goldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 dimgray (with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a general film coating.
            Fingerprint patterns may be visible if the adhesive was applied by hand.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension effects. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application method and
            the amount of adhesive used. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on Rhenium typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellowish
            or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting irregular patterns
            and variations in thickness. Over time, the residue can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common, with thicker deposits at edges, corners, and areas where
            the adhesive was initially applied. Streaks and drip marks indicate the direction of adhesive flow.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. The center of
            a flat surface may have a thinner coating or be relatively free of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more
            residue due to pooling. Sharp edges and corners act as nucleation sites for thicker deposits.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and thicker deposits at
            the bottom of vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes more matte, the gloss
            diminishes. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy surface upon drying. With
            aging and degradation, the texture becomes rougher, more brittle, and potentially powdery or crusty, especially
            at edges and thicker deposits.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 micrometers for thin films, up to 50 micrometers in thicker deposits
            or drip marks. Heavily aged and built-up areas can reach thicknesses of 100-200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, pools (in concave areas), crusts (at edges and thicker deposits), and
            patches (where the adhesive was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        rhodium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is often translucent and difficult to see, exhibiting a slight tackiness.
            Aged residue (months/years) becomes more opaque, darker in color, harder, and potentially brittle, often with
            visible cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, almost invisible film. Over days/weeks, the residue
            becomes more visible and tacky. Over months/years, it hardens, darkens, and may develop cracks or flakes, becoming
            increasingly difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (extreme aging, potential contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and uneven films are common. Fingerprints
            or patterns from the original tape application may be visible.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in any surface imperfections or crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) is most common, but extreme coverage (>85%) can occur in areas
            where tape was repeatedly applied or residue was allowed to accumulate for extended periods.
          description: Adhesive residue on rhodium presents as a thin, often translucent or slightly opaque film, exhibiting
            a range of yellowish to brownish hues. Coverage varies from sparse spots to more extensive, uneven coatings, often
            concentrated along edges or in recessed areas. The residue's appearance changes significantly with age, transitioning
            from a sticky, almost invisible layer to a hardened, discolored film.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated along edges, corners, and in recessed areas. May follow the
            original pattern of the adhesive tape.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and the tendency for adhesive to spread
            outwards from the tape's edge.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Recessed areas and corners tend to accumulate
            more residue due to capillary action and reduced cleaning effectiveness.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive residue, leading
            to thicker deposits at the bottom. Pooling may occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities caused by the residue become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, hardened, and sometimes crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly crystalline or amorphous structure depending on
            the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age), and
            irregular patches are common formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films to highly localized
            and uneven deposits.
        rosewood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or light yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens to tan or brown, becomes less tacky, and may harden or become brittle. Oxidation and dust accumulation
            contribute to color change and increased opacity.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive may spread slightly
            and become more tacky. After weeks/months, oxidation and dust accumulation lead to discoloration and hardening.
            Years later, the residue may become brittle and crack, forming a crusty or powdery surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 (Light Yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#F5DEB3 (Beige, slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 (Tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F (Sienna, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna Brown, residue mixed with rosewood dust)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the wood grain, drip marks (if applied vertically), and uniform
            coatings where tape was fully adhered. Residue often outlines the shape of the original adhesive material.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive material,
            in crevices and pores of the wood, and in areas where the adhesive was applied more liberally. Flat surfaces may
            exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type and amount of adhesive used and the duration
            of contact. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on rosewood presents as a hazy, often glossy film with color ranging from translucent
            yellow to opaque tan. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often revealing the underlying
            wood grain with reduced clarity. The residue tends to accumulate in pores and along grain lines.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following the grain, outlines of tape edges, and overall film coatings.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges, creating a visible outline of the original adhesive material. Center
            areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Concave surfaces may trap adhesive, leading to thicker deposits. Convex surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform
            coatings.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling may occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light more intensely than the surrounding rosewood.
            Aged residue tends to become matte or develop a slight haze, reducing reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface
            irregularities become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, sometimes crusty or powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness depending on
            the adhesive type and age.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) in areas
            where adhesive pooled or was applied heavily.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (where adhesive was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            with distinct edges and varying thicknesses.
        rubber:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker, harder, and potentially brittle, often exhibiting cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue may spread slightly
            and become tackier. Over weeks/months, it hardens, darkens, and may crack or flake. Years of exposure can lead
            to a thick, brittle crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (translucent yellowish, fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 (pale yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C18F (tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#B39768 (dark tan, heavily aged)'
          - '#826A47 (brown, very old/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and defined edges corresponding to the original tape dimensions. Can
            also present as a thin, uneven film across the affected area. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentration often observed at the edges of the original tape application area
            and in crevices or surface imperfections on the rubber. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, albeit thinner,
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application,
            and environmental conditions. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on rubber presents as a patchy, often glossy or matte film, ranging in color from
            translucent yellowish to opaque tan. Coverage varies greatly, leaving behind a sticky or hardened layer that conforms
            to the rubber's surface texture. The residue often exhibits a distinct edge where the tape was removed.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to the area where the adhesive tape was applied. Can spread slightly
            beyond the original tape boundary due to adhesive flow or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Often exhibits higher concentration at the edges of the original tape application area due
            to adhesive squeeze-out and residue accumulation during removal. The center may have a more uniform, thinner coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and depressions. Raised areas may have less residue due to abrasion or cleaning.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulation
            at the bottom of the affected area. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a glossy sheen. Aged residue can be matte or have a slight sheen
            depending on the degree of oxidation and surface roughness. Under oblique lighting, the residue's texture becomes
            more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a hardened, smooth, or slightly rough texture. May
            exhibit a crystalline or powdery surface as it ages and dries. Some residues remain persistently tacky.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age), and
            distinct patches corresponding to the tape's shape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from a perfectly uniform thin film to highly irregular patches
            and streaks.
        ruthenium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and translucent. Aged residue becomes darker, more opaque, and prone to
            cracking and flaking. Oxidation and environmental contaminants contribute to color changes and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial adhesion occurs within minutes. Within hours, the residue begins to set and become
            less tacky. Over days, oxidation and environmental contamination begin to alter the color and texture. After months,
            the residue becomes significantly darker, brittle, and more difficult to remove. Years of exposure lead to significant
            carbonization and permanent staining.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly thicker, newer residue)'
          - '#B8860B goldenrod (moderate aging, thicker deposits)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (significant aging, oxidized)'
          - '#654321 darkbrown (extreme aging, carbonized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, and outlines corresponding to the original tape dimensions. Often exhibits
            a 'ghosting' effect where the tape edges were.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape, in corners,
            and in any surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare and usually indicates
            excessive adhesive application or prolonged exposure.
          description: Adhesive residue on Ruthenium appears as a thin, often iridescent film with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. Coverage is typically localized, following the original tape pattern, and can range from sparse to moderate.
            Over time, the residue darkens and becomes more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas previously covered by adhesive tape. Can exhibit a gradient
            of concentration, with higher concentrations at the edges of the tape and lower concentrations in the center.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape area due to adhesive squeeze-out during application. Center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can cause downward flow and streaking of the residue, especially
            when fresh. Pooling can occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or iridescence due to thin-film interference. Aged residue
            becomes matte and less reflective. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities are more pronounced.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, then rough, and eventually brittle/crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and
            occasional particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 micrometers, with thicker accumulations near tape edges or areas
            of pooling. Extreme cases can reach up to 25 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, and occasional drip marks (if applied to a vertical surface).
            Aged residue can form brittle crusts and flakes.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting thickness variations
            and localized accumulations.
        sandstone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or pale yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens, becomes brittle, and incorporates environmental contaminants, leading to a dull, discolored appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to dry and
            attract dust. Within weeks, discoloration and hardening become noticeable. After months/years, the residue becomes
            brittle, heavily contaminated, and difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#D1B880 amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B38B56 dark amber (heavily aged)'
          - '#805533 brownish-black (oxidized/dirt-embedded)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines corresponding to the original tape shape, streaks
            from adhesive transfer during removal, and localized spots where adhesive pooled or dripped. Dust and dirt accumulation
            often accentuate these patterns.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape outline,
            in corners, and within crevices of the sandstone. Lighter concentrations occur on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the original tape application
            and subsequent weathering. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are frequently observed.
          description: Adhesive residue on sandstone typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in color
            from a pale yellow to a dark amber, often with a mottled or streaked appearance due to uneven application and
            aging. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape application
            and sandstone porosity.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, streaks, localized spots, drip marks, and overall film coatings are
            common. The distribution is heavily influenced by the original tape application and the sandstone's surface irregularities.
          edge_center_behavior: Adhesive often prefers edges of the original tape outline due to capillary action and the
            tendency for adhesive to squeeze out during application. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Adhesive tends to accumulate in depressions,
            corners, and along edges. Raised areas may have minimal residue due to abrasion or cleaning efforts.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the base
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also a common manifestation of gravity's influence.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged residue is typically
            matte due to surface roughness and dirt accumulation. Oblique lighting can highlight the textural variations.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rough, crusty, or even powdery
            surface as the adhesive degrades and attracts dust/particulates. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform
            distribution with areas of concentrated adhesive and voids.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick, pooled residue), with
            an average thickness of 10-100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Pools of adhesive can form in depressions. Thin
            films cover larger areas. Crusts develop as the adhesive dries and hardens. Patches represent areas of concentrated
            residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant variations
            in thickness and concentration across the affected area.
        sapphire glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears as a clear or slightly yellowish film. Over time (months/years), it yellows,
            darkens, and hardens, becoming more difficult to remove. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute to discoloration
            and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is present (hours). Over days, dust and debris accumulate, increasing
            thickness and visibility. After months, oxidation and hardening occur, leading to discoloration and increased
            adhesion. Years of exposure result in a brittle, difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 (light yellow, fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C (khaki, slightly aged)'
          - '#D2B48C (tan, moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B (darkgoldenrod, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 (saddlebrown, severely aged/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from wiping, irregular patches, and a thin, uniform coating across the
            surface are common. Fingerprints and smudges are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original adhesive application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more uniform layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the initial adhesive application and subsequent cleaning
            attempts. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare on sapphire glass unless intentionally applied.
          description: 'Adhesive residue on sapphire glass typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. The residue can range from a barely visible haze
            to distinct, sticky patches, depending on the adhesive type and removal method. Dominant colors are #F5F5DC (beige)
            and #D2B48C (tan).'
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often concentrated in areas where the adhesive was initially applied or where
            it flowed during application. Wiping or cleaning attempts often result in streaks and uneven distribution.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension effects. The center
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating or be relatively clean if wiped.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Sharp edges may exhibit a 'wicking' effect, drawing residue along the edge.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking. Pooling occurs in horizontal
            or near-horizontal orientations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with
            reduced reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with potential for
            a slightly rough or uneven surface due to dust accumulation or adhesive degradation. May exhibit a crystalline
            or powdery appearance in heavily aged areas.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 20 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied vertically), pools in low-lying areas, crusts in areas of
            heavy buildup, and irregular patches are common formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        scandium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears clearer and more flexible. Aged residue darkens, becomes more brittle, and
            may exhibit signs of cracking or flaking. Oxidation products can contribute to a dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited upon tape application. Over hours/days, the adhesive
            may spread slightly or undergo minor chemical changes. Over months/years, oxidation, UV exposure, and environmental
            factors lead to hardening, discoloration, and increased tackiness of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin residue)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged, thicker residue)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, significant oxidation)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to the adhesive contact points of the tape, streaks from tape removal,
            and occasional drip marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners or crevices where adhesive may have pooled, and on surfaces that were in direct contact with the adhesive
            layer. Lighter concentrations are found on flat surfaces away from the tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the tape type, application
            method, and removal process. Heavy or extreme coverage is less common unless the tape was intentionally applied
            with excessive adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on Scandium presents as a thin, often translucent film with a slight yellow or amber
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate films, influenced by the tape's original application. Over
            time, oxidation and environmental factors can darken the residue and increase its tackiness.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the original tape edges and contact points. Can
            also exhibit streaking patterns from tape removal or adhesive spreading.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the concentration of adhesive at the tape's perimeter. The center area
            may have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            crevices, and along edges. Rough surfaces provide more anchor points for the adhesive, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can cause the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in vertical
            streaking and pooling at the bottom. This effect is more pronounced with liquid or semi-liquid adhesives.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte due to surface roughening and oxidation. The translucency of the residue allows the underlying Scandium
            surface to influence the overall appearance.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, transitioning to a more crusty or hardened texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness depending
            on the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations occurring at edges or points
            of concentrated adhesive application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, small pools or droplets, crusts along edges, and irregular patches. Drip marks may
            be present on vertical surfaces.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from near-perfect uniformity in very thin films to highly non-uniform
            in areas with thicker accumulations or uneven application.
        schist:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically pliable and transparent. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            brittle, opaque, and darker in color due to oxidation and degradation. It may also exhibit cracking and flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over hours/days, gravity causes some flow and pooling.
            Over weeks/months, the adhesive dries and hardens, forming thicker deposits and crusts. Over years, oxidation
            and degradation lead to discoloration, cracking, and flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C18F medium yellow-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#B39768 dark yellow-brown (heavily aged)'
          - '#806B42 dark brown (severely aged, potentially oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the schist's foliation, drip marks where adhesive flowed
            downwards, and irregular patches corresponding to the original tape's contact area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape footprint,
            in crevices, and along the lower edges of vertically oriented surfaces due to gravitational flow. Lighter concentrations
            are observed on raised areas of the schist's surface.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), with heavy (>60%) coverage only in areas
            directly under the original tape or where pooling occurred.
          description: Adhesive residue on schist presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint, irregularly distributed across the foliated surface. Coverage varies from sparse speckles to near-complete
            coatings, influenced by the schist's texture and the adhesive's initial application. The residue tends to accumulate
            in the troughs of the schist's undulating surface.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily follows the contours of the schist's foliation. Accumulation occurs in depressions
            and along cleavage planes. Areas directly under the original tape exhibit the highest concentration.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape footprint and crevices over the center of flat surfaces.
            Edges often exhibit a raised ridge of accumulated adhesive.
          geometry_effects: The schist's rough surface and foliation act as barriers and channels, influencing the adhesive's
            flow and distribution. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more residue than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with freshly applied adhesive.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, the uneven distribution and surface texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more brittle, sometimes powdery
            or crusty consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. The surface
            can exhibit micro-cracking, especially in thicker deposits.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (thick deposits), with an average thickness between
            10 μm and 100 μm.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks, small pools in depressions, crusts formed by dried adhesive, and irregular
            patches mirroring the shape of the original tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The distribution is rarely uniform, with significant variations in thickness
            and coverage across the surface.
        serpentine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, pliable, and sticky. Aged residue
            (months/years) darkens, becomes brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute
            to the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial application (0-24 hours) results in a thin, uniform film. After 1-7 days, slight thickening
            and edge accumulation occur. After 1-6 months, oxidation and darkening become noticeable. After 6+ months, embrittlement,
            cracking, and flaking may occur, with further darkening and hardening of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (carbonized, extreme aging)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the tape direction, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and
            a general film coating where the tape was applied. Residue often accumulates along edges and in crevices of the
            serpentine surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in crevices and surface imperfections, and at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity-induced flow. Flat
            surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application method, and removal process.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged tape application and incomplete removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on serpentine typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a slight
            sheen to noticeable discoloration. The residue often appears as localized spots or streaks, with color variations
            depending on the adhesive type and age, ranging from a light yellow to a dark amber.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, film coatings, edge accumulation, crevice filling, and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue accumulation
            during tape removal. The center area typically has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and curvature significantly influence residue distribution. Rough surfaces provide
            more anchor points for the adhesive, leading to higher concentrations. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more
            residue than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks on vertical surfaces and
            pooling in low-lying areas. This effect is more pronounced with fresh residue that is still pliable.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte or dull.
            The translucency of the residue allows the underlying serpentine texture to be partially visible, creating subtle
            variations in light reflection.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture evolves to become more brittle and crusty with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness, often
            exhibiting a slightly crystalline or powdery appearance in aged samples.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (sparse, almost invisible layer) to 50 micrometers (thick, noticeable
            buildup). In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 200 micrometers, especially along edges or in crevices.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts along edges,
            and patches where the tape was unevenly applied.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thickness and concentration
            varying significantly across the surface.
        shale:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, tacky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens, becomes brittle, less tacky, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation and
            UV exposure contribute to the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (within hours). Over days, solvent evaporation
            causes the adhesive to become more viscous and concentrated. Over months, oxidation, UV exposure, and dust accumulation
            lead to darkening, embrittlement, and the formation of a crusty surface layer. Years of exposure can result in
            significant degradation and potential chemical alteration of the adhesive residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 ivory-white (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8A7 pale-yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C17E amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B79556 light-brown (heavily aged)'
          - '#916F3E dark-brown (oxidized/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if the
            adhesive was fluid, and a general film coating across the contact area. Fingerprints and other handling marks
            are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            area, in corners, and within crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application pressure,
            and removal method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare, usually only occurring with deliberate and heavy adhesive
            application.
          description: Adhesive residue on shale presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse speckles to near-complete coatings, dictated by the original tape application.
            The residue tends to accumulate in shale's natural micro-crevices and along cleavage planes.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread along shale
            cleavage planes and into micro-fissures due to capillary action.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges of the original tape area tend to have a higher concentration of residue due to adhesive
            squeeze-out during application and potential tearing during removal. The center may have a more uniform, but potentially
            thinner, coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and topography significantly influence residue distribution. Residue tends to
            accumulate in valleys and depressions, while peaks may be relatively free of residue.
          gravity_influence: With liquid adhesives, gravity causes downward flow and pooling at lower points on the shale
            surface, resulting in vertical streaking and thicker accumulations at the bottom of inclined surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes brittle,
            and often powdery or crusty surface as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying
            degrees of smoothness and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and shale surface characteristics.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick accumulation), with an
            average thickness between 5 and 50 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in depressions, crusts on exposed surfaces,
            and patchy coverage corresponding to the original tape pattern.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, exhibiting significant thickness and concentration
            variations across the surface.
        silicon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or light yellow and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or orange, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate
            degradation.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time: 1) Initial adhesion (seconds/minutes); 2) Transfer of adhesive
            upon tape removal (minutes/hours); 3) Solvent evaporation and hardening (hours/days); 4) Oxidation and degradation
            (weeks/months); 5) Cracking and flaking (months/years).'
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFE0 (light yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#F0E68C (khaki, slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 (burly wood, moderately aged)'
          - '#CD853F (peru, aged with oxidation)'
          - '#8B4513 (saddle brown, heavily aged/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots where the tape initially adhered, streaks from wiping or
            peeling, and drip marks if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. Fingerprint patterns are also possible.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape area, in
            corners or crevices, and where the tape was initially applied with greater pressure. Lighter concentrations are
            found on flat surfaces away from the original tape edges.
          coverage_ranges: 'Coverage ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - scattered patches; Moderate
            (30-60%) - significant coverage with bare areas; Heavy (60-85%) - almost complete coverage; Extreme (>85%) - complete
            coverage with thick deposits.'
          description: Adhesive residue on silicon appears as a non-uniform, often patchy film with a dominant color range
            from translucent yellow to brownish-orange. Coverage varies greatly depending on the tape type and removal method,
            ranging from sparse to heavy.
          distribution_patterns: 'Distribution types include: 1) Uniform thin film (rare, after solvent cleaning); 2) Patchy
            coverage with distinct edges; 3) Concentrated spots at the original tape contact points; 4) Streaks from wiping
            or dragging; 5) Ring-like formations around the edges of former adhesive spots.'
          edge_center_behavior: Residue often prefers edges due to the initial adhesive contact and potential for buildup
            during tape removal. However, the center can also have high concentrations if the tape was pressed firmly in that
            area.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in valleys, grooves,
            and around sharp edges. Flat surfaces are more likely to have a thin, uniform film.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the pattern of liquid adhesives, causing downward flow and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to
            be matte and may show iridescence due to thin-film interference if the layer is very thin and uniform.
          texture_details: Texture ranges from sticky and slightly tacky when fresh to hardened, crusty, and sometimes powdery
            when aged. Microscopic analysis may reveal a network of polymer strands or a smooth, glassy surface depending
            on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 0.1 micrometers (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue).
            Average thickness is typically between 1 and 10 micrometers.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films; 2) Drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used); 3)
            Pools of hardened adhesive; 4) Crusts or flakes of degraded adhesive; 5) Patches of varying thickness and color.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is highly variable. It can range from perfectly uniform (after attempted cleaning
            with solvents) to extremely non-uniform with thick deposits and thin films interspersed.
        silicon carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hard, brittle, and more difficult
            to remove. Color darkens significantly, and the surface may exhibit cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, relatively uniform film (hours). Over days, residue migrates
            to edges and corners. After weeks, the residue begins to oxidize and harden. Months/years lead to significant
            darkening, embrittlement, and potential flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B DarkGoldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 SaddleBrown (heavily aged)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (oxidized/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and patches, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a
            general film coating. Residue tends to accumulate along edges and in surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentrations at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension.
            Lighter concentrations on flat surfaces. Crevices and surface imperfections act as collection points for the residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (60-85%) coverage can occur in areas
            of repeated application or improper removal. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with complete adhesive
            failure.
          description: Adhesive residue on SiC typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown tint,
            often exhibiting uneven coverage and localized concentrations. Over time, it can darken and become more brittle,
            forming crust-like deposits in certain areas.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where the tape was initially
            applied. Streaks are common due to the adhesive transfer during tape removal. Can also form circular patterns
            corresponding to the shape of the adhesive material.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension. Center areas typically
            have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote buildup due to increased surface area and capillary forces. Recessed
            areas and surface imperfections trap residue, leading to localized concentrations.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and streaks. Pooling
            occurs in depressions and horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under oblique
            lighting, variations in thickness and surface texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy film. With age, it becomes
            brittle, crusty, and may exhibit a powdery or crystalline surface due to degradation and oxidation. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, with localized buildup reaching up to 20 micrometers
            in areas of pooling or repeated application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (localized areas of high concentration).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible thin films to thick, localized deposits. Uniformity
            depends heavily on the application method and the properties of the adhesive.
        silicon carbide (sic):
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellowish and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or amber, becomes brittle, and may develop a powdery or cracked surface. Oxidation and UV degradation
            contribute to color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, uniform film. Over days, the residue begins to migrate
            and accumulate at edges. Over weeks/months, oxidation and degradation lead to color change, embrittlement, and
            the formation of crusts and powders. Dust and contaminants further contribute to the buildup and alter the residue's
            appearance.

          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#B8860B DarkGoldenrod (moderate aging, thicker deposits)'
          - '#8B4513 SaddleBrown (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (dust-contaminated, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the tape application direction, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and a general film coating. Residue tends to accumulate at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentrations at edges, corners, and crevices. Lighter concentrations on flat,
            exposed surfaces. Areas under the tape's initial contact point often have the highest concentration.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application pressure, and removal
            technique. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or prolonged exposure.
          description: Adhesive residue on SiC typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown (amber)
            tint, often exhibiting a mottled appearance due to uneven application and subsequent degradation. The residue
            can range from a barely visible sheen to a more substantial, sticky layer, depending on the adhesive type and
            exposure conditions. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete surface coating.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of where the tape was applied and in
            areas where the tape was creased or folded. Streaks are common, following the direction of tape removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to capillary action and surface tension effects. The center of the taped
            area often has a thinner, more uniform layer compared to the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., scratches, steps) influence residue accumulation. Residue
            tends to pool in valleys and accumulate along edges of raised features.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive residue, resulting
            in thicker deposits at the bottom. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            more matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Dust contamination can further reduce reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more brittle, crusty, or powdery texture
            with age and exposure to UV light or heat. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying
            degrees of roughness, depending on the adhesive type and application method. Some residues may exhibit a slightly
            crystalline appearance upon drying.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 50 micrometers)
            at edges and corners.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in surface depressions), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches (where tape was torn or overlapped).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films (rare) to highly
            non-uniform deposits with distinct edges and variations in thickness.
        silicon germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) darkens,
            becomes more opaque, and loses its tackiness, often developing a brittle or crusty surface. Oxidation and environmental
            contaminants contribute to the color change.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited upon tape removal (minutes/hours). Over days,
            the residue migrates and concentrates at edges and corners. Over weeks/months, oxidation and environmental contamination
            lead to darkening and crust formation. After years, the residue becomes brittle and may flake off, leaving behind
            a discolored stain.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#B8860B DarkGoldenrod (moderately aged, concentrated)'
          - '#8B4513 SaddleBrown (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (residue with particulate contamination)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a
            general film coating are common. Residue often accumulates around the perimeter of where the tape was applied.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension.
            Lighter concentration on flat surfaces, often appearing as a thin, barely visible film. Crevices and surface imperfections
            act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the type of tape, application method,
            and removal process. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on SiGe appears as a non-uniform, often patchy coating with a dominant yellowish-brown
            hue. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, exhibiting varying degrees of thickness and
            color intensity depending on age and exposure. It often presents as a thin film with localized thicker deposits.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential accumulation at edges, corners, and surface defects. Streaks
            are common from tape removal. On vertical surfaces, gravitational effects lead to downward flow and pooling at
            the bottom.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension. The center of the taped
            area may have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Edges and corners act as collection points
            due to increased surface area and capillary forces. Grooves and scratches trap residue, leading to localized buildup.
          gravity_influence: Significant on vertical surfaces, leading to downward flow and pooling at the bottom. This results
            in thicker deposits at the lower edge and thinner films higher up.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss or sheen under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. The presence of particulate matter can further scatter light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rougher, sometimes crusty or
            powdery feel with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure with potential for
            embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly, ranging from a few nanometers (undetectable by eye) to several
            micrometers (1-10 μm) in thicker deposits, and potentially up to 50 μm in extreme cases of pooling or buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (localized areas of concentrated residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, typically exhibiting significant
            thickness and concentration gradients across the surface.
        silicon nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often pliable and easily smeared. Over time (weeks to months), it hardens, darkens,
            and becomes more difficult to remove. Cracking and flaking may occur in thicker deposits.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, often invisible film (0-24 hours). Over the next few days,
            the adhesive spreads slightly and becomes more visible. Weeks to months lead to hardening, darkening, and potential
            cracking of thicker deposits. Years can result in significant degradation and embrittlement of the residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, newer residue)'
          - '#DEB887 ''BurlyWood'' (moderate thickness, aged a few weeks)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (thick, heavily aged residue)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (extremely aged, degraded residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots from tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if applied in liquid
            form, and uniform coating if the adhesive was spread across the surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the adhesive area, in corners
            or crevices, and where the tape was initially applied with greater pressure. Lighter concentrations are found
            in the center of the adhesive area or where the tape was loosely applied.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the application method and the amount of adhesive
            used. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common for typical tape residue.
          description: Adhesive residue on silicon nitride typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a
            yellowish-brown to amber coloration. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting
            irregular edges and variations in thickness. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform films, edge accumulation, and patterns mirroring the original
            tape or adhesive application method.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to capillary action and surface tension during application and drying.
            Center distribution depends on the application method; uniform spreading leads to center coverage, while spot
            application results in localized center concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., steps, trenches) can trap adhesive, leading to increased
            concentration in those areas. Sharp edges tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity will cause downward flow and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially when wet. Aged residue tends to
            be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Interference fringes (iridescence) may be visible in very thin films
            due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture evolves to become smooth and glassy when thin,
            or rough and crusty/brittle when thicker and aged. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous
            structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 micrometers (extremely thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue).
            Average thickness is often between 1-10 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of solidified adhesive, crusts formed
            from dried adhesive, and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (spin-coated adhesive) to extremely non-uniform
            (residue from haphazard tape application).
        silver:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue hardens, darkens, and may exhibit cracking
            or flaking. Oxidation products from the adhesive can react with the silver, creating tarnish underneath.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, sticky film is present (hours/days). Over weeks/months, the residue hardens
            and darkens. After months/years, it becomes brittle, cracks, and may react with the silver, causing tarnish and
            potentially forming a crusty layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3D170 pale goldenrod (moderately aged)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, and uniform
            films where tape was fully adhered. Drip marks may be present if adhesive was applied in liquid form or melted.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the original tape application and removal
            process. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are common.
          description: Adhesive residue on silver presents as a thin, often translucent or yellowish film, sometimes with
            iridescent patches. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape's
            application. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform films, edge concentrations, and patterns mirroring the
            original tape's shape.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            a more uniform, thinner coating, or be relatively clean if the tape was not fully adhered.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas,
            corners, and along edges. Raised areas may have a thinner coating due to easier removal.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces may exhibit more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or have a
            dull appearance. Iridescence can occur due to thin-film interference effects, especially in areas with varying
            thickness.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy surface as it dries. Over
            time, it becomes brittle, potentially cracking and exhibiting a powdery or crusty texture in localized areas.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened adhesive, crusts formed
            by oxidation and degradation, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform distributions
            with thick spots and thin patches.
        slate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically translucent and sticky. Over time (weeks to months), it oxidizes, darkens
            in color, and becomes less tacky, often developing a brittle or powdery surface. Years of aging can lead to a
            hardened, almost varnish-like appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (0-24 hours): Thin, sticky film. Days to weeks: Gradual darkening and
            loss of tackiness. Months to years: Hardening, embrittlement, and potential for cracking or flaking. Color darkens
            significantly.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8A7 light tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B374 honey-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#B78D52 amber-brown (aged)'
          - '#916938 dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied as a liquid adhesive),
            and a general film coating. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary
            action.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges, in corners, within surface imperfections
            (pores, fissures), and at the termination points of streaks. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial application and subsequent cleaning attempts.
            Light (10-30%) is most common after initial tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on slate appears as a thin, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent to
            opaque. Color varies from a light yellow-brown to a darker, almost amber hue, depending on the adhesive type and
            age. Coverage can range from sparse spots to a near-uniform coating, often concentrated along edges or in surface
            imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, streaky, film-like, edge-concentrated, crevice-filled.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Center areas tend to
            have thinner, more uniform coverage.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and slope significantly influence distribution. Rough surfaces provide more
            anchor points for residue, while sloped surfaces encourage downward flow and pooling.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesives, resulting in drip marks and pooling at lower
            points. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct light. Aged residue
            tends to be more matte, with light scattering due to the rougher surface texture. Some adhesives may exhibit iridescence
            due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rougher, sometimes crusty or powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and occasional
            crystalline formations, especially in areas with thicker residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thicker spots or drip marks).
            In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 200 micrometers in crevices or corners.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (vertical or angled), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            patches (irregularly shaped deposits).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        soapstone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or pale yellow and highly adhesive. Over time (weeks to months),
            it darkens, hardens, and becomes less tacky, often developing a brittle or crusty texture. Oxidation and UV exposure
            contribute to discoloration and degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs within hours of tape application. Over days, the adhesive begins to
            cure and harden. After weeks to months, oxidation and degradation lead to discoloration, embrittlement, and potential
            flaking of the residue. Cleaning attempts can either remove the residue or spread it further, depending on the
            method used.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD pale yellow (fresh residue)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3C16F dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#C4A484 sandy brown (aged, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, distinct tape outlines, streaks from adhesive transfer during removal, drip marks
            if adhesive was applied in liquid form, and a general 'shadow' effect where the tape was positioned.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found at the edges of the tape outline, in corners, and
            in crevices or surface imperfections where the adhesive can accumulate. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more
            uniform residue layers.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the type of tape and the duration of its application.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the adhesive was intentionally applied over a large area.
          description: Adhesive residue on soapstone presents as a thin, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent
            to opaque, with colors varying from pale yellow to dark amber depending on the adhesive type and age. Coverage
            patterns are typically localized to areas where tape was applied, often exhibiting distinct edge marks and varying
            degrees of residue transfer.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas of tape application, with distinct edges corresponding to the tape's perimeter.
            May also exhibit streaks or smears resulting from tape removal or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out and accumulation during tape application. The center
            area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            grooves, and corners, while raised areas may have minimal residue.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause liquid adhesive to flow downward, resulting in drip marks and pooling at lower
            points on vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes even distribution of liquid adhesive but
            can also lead to pooling in low-lying areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen, especially under direct lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. The soapstone itself may appear slightly darker underneath
            the residue due to altered light absorption.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film or a brittle, crusty
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. Some residues may exhibit
            a powdery surface due to degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened adhesive, brittle crusts,
            and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to uneven patches with significant
            thickness variations.
        soda-lime glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellowish and highly adhesive. Over time (months/years),
            it yellows, hardens, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake. Degradation can lead to a darker, brownish or even
            blackish appearance, accompanied by a loss of adhesion.
          buildup_progression: Initial application results in a relatively uniform film (hours). Evaporation of solvents leads
            to increased viscosity and tackiness (days). Oxidation and crosslinking cause hardening and yellowing (weeks/months).
            Degradation and embrittlement occur over longer periods (months/years), leading to cracking, flaking, and discoloration.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2F0E6 ivory (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8A7 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B46A amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B78631 dark amber (heavily aged)'
          - '#8A550D brownish-black (burnt/degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a general film coating are common.
            Residue often concentrates along edges and corners due to surface tension effects during application and evaporation.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings, unless disturbed during
            application or removal.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial application and subsequent removal efforts.
            Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common after tape removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on soda-lime glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from
            a faint yellowish hue to a more pronounced amber. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings,
            often exhibiting irregular patterns and edge effects.
          distribution_patterns:
          - Uniform film
          - Localized spots/patches
          - Edge/corner accumulation
          - Streaks (vertical or horizontal)
          - Drip marks (vertical surfaces)
          - Fingerprint patterns
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects, but can also exhibit a more
            uniform distribution across the center of the glass surface, especially with thin films.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote adhesive buildup due to surface tension. Concave surfaces tend
            to trap more residue than convex surfaces. Textured surfaces increase the surface area for adhesion, leading to
            more residue retention.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom. On horizontal surfaces, gravity promotes pooling and a more even distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and degrades, the surface becomes
            more matte. Under oblique lighting, irregularities and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with potential for
            a powdery or crusty surface upon aging and degradation. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly rough texture
            due to uneven distribution and particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of concentrated
            buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (due to
            drying and oxidation), and patches (where adhesive was unevenly applied or removed).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform distributions
            with thick and thin areas.
        stainless steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or pale yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens to a brownish hue, hardens, and becomes less tacky, often developing a brittle or powdery surface layer.
            Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, the adhesive migrates and accumulates
            at edges. After weeks/months, hardening and discoloration occur. Years of exposure lead to a brittle, crusty,
            and heavily discolored residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D1BFA0 medium yellow-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#B39773 dark brown (aged)'
          - '#806A4D dark, almost black-brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the original tape application, drip marks (if applied vertically),
            and a general film-like coating are common. Fingerprints and other handling marks may be visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners and crevices, and in areas where the adhesive pooled. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even
            coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application,
            and cleaning methods used. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with repeated tape applications and inadequate
            cleaning.
          description: Adhesive residue on stainless steel presents as a thin, often translucent or slightly opaque film,
            exhibiting a range of yellowish to brownish hues. Coverage varies from sparse spots to more extensive, uneven
            coatings, frequently revealing the underlying brushed or polished texture of the stainless steel. The residue
            tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns:
          - Edge accumulation (along tape edges)
          - Localized spots (where adhesive was initially applied)
          - Streaks (parallel to tape direction)
          - Film-like coating (thin, even layer)
          - Crevice filling (accumulation in surface imperfections)
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive bleed-out from the tape and subsequent accumulation. The center
            of the taped area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and any surface imperfections. Raised areas may have less residue due to wiping or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and a thicker accumulation at the bottom edge of the tape area. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light more readily than the surrounding
            stainless steel. Aged residue tends to be more matte, with reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, the unevenness
            of the residue becomes more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a more hardened, sometimes crusty
            or powdery consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure. The surface
            can exhibit slight variations in roughness depending on the adhesive type and application method.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 100 micrometers) possible
            in areas of pooling or repeated application.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), thin films (on flat surfaces), crusts
            (aged, hardened residue), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with significant variations in
            thickness and concentration across the surface.
        stainless steel 304:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and easily smeared. Aged residue darkens, hardens,
            and becomes more difficult to remove, often exhibiting a brittle or cracked surface.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape removal. Within hours, volatile components evaporate,
            causing the residue to harden. Over days, the residue becomes more tenacious. After months, it darkens and may
            become brittle or crusty, making removal significantly more difficult. Years of exposure can lead to carbonization
            and extremely difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (translucent, fresh residue)'
          - '#E6D8A2 (pale yellow, slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B474 (yellow-brown, moderately aged)'
          - '#B38B4A (dark brown, heavily aged)'
          - '#916324 (very dark brown, carbonized residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to the original tape adhesive points, streaks from wiping or cleaning
            attempts, and drip marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the tape type, application
            method, and removal process. Heavy (>60%) to extreme (>85%) coverage is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives
            or improper removal techniques.
          description: Adhesive residue on stainless steel 304 typically presents as a thin, often uneven film with a yellowish-brown
            to translucent appearance. Coverage varies from sparse speckles to moderate coatings, influenced by the adhesive
            type and removal method. Over time, it can darken and become more tenacious.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, thin films, and edge buildup are common. The pattern directly reflects
            the original tape application and any subsequent cleaning efforts.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center area under
            the tape may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            along edges, and in any surface imperfections or scratches. Raised areas may have less residue due to wiping or
            abrasion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid or semi-liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking
            or pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with freshly applied residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or have a dull
            appearance. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain adhesive types due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a smooth, hardened film as volatile
            components evaporate. With age and exposure to environmental factors, it can become crusty or powdery, especially
            at the edges.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if applied as a liquid), pools in low-lying areas, crusts along edges,
            and patches corresponding to the original tape contact points.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, usually exhibiting significant variations in thickness
            and concentration across the surface.
        stainless steel 316:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is often clear or slightly yellowish and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to a brownish or tan color, becomes less sticky, and may develop a hard, crusty texture. Oxidation and
            UV exposure accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (0-24 hours): Thin, clear, sticky film. Days 1-7: Slight yellowing, increased
            tackiness. Weeks 1-4: Noticeable discoloration, dust accumulation. Months 1-12: Hardening, crust formation, further
            discoloration. Years 1+: Significant oxidation, potential for corrosion under the residue.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F0F8FF (Almost Invisible - Fresh, Thin)'
          - '#FFFACD (Lemon Chiffon - Slightly Aged, Thin)'
          - '#EEE8AA (Pale Goldenrod - Moderately Aged, Thicker)'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan - Aged, Oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna - Heavily Aged, Contaminated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from tape removal), drip marks (if applied vertically), and
            a thin, even film across the surface are common. Fingerprints and other handling marks are often accentuated by
            the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and around fastener heads. Lighter concentration
            on flat, exposed surfaces. Crevices and surface imperfections tend to trap residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare and usually indicates
            a significant spill or prolonged exposure to adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on stainless steel 316 typically presents as a thin, often iridescent film with localized
            areas of thicker, discolored buildup. The residue ranges from nearly invisible to a noticeable yellowish-brown,
            depending on the adhesive type and age. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate films, often concentrated
            along edges and corners.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where tape was initially
            applied. Streaks are common from wiping or tape removal. Can also be a uniform thin film across the entire surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. The center of a flat
            surface typically has the least amount of residue.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Recessed areas and grooves also trap residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and streaks. On horizontal
            surfaces, gravity leads to pooling and a more even distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit iridescence under certain lighting conditions due to thin-film interference.
            Aged residue tends to be matte or have a slight sheen, depending on the degree of oxidation and surface roughness.
            Gloss is generally absent.
          texture_details: Initially, the residue is often smooth and slightly sticky. Over time, it can become rough, crusty,
            or powdery due to oxidation, dust accumulation, and degradation of the adhesive polymers. Microscopic examination
            may reveal crystalline structures in some aged residues.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.1 micrometers (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick buildup). Heavily aged
            or concentrated areas can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (on horizontal surfaces), crusts (aged
            residue), and patches (where tape was applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, very thin film) to highly variable
            (localized spots and streaks).
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Over months/years, it hardens, darkens, and becomes
            more difficult to remove. Cracking and flaking are common.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, tackiness decreases and dust
            accumulates. Over months, oxidation and hardening occur, leading to discoloration and embrittlement. Over years,
            cracking, flaking, and potential corrosion of the steel underneath become apparent.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD (Lemon Chiffon) - Fresh residue, thin layer'
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki) - Slightly aged, thicker layer'
          - '#BDB76B (Dark Khaki) - Moderately aged, oxidized'
          - '#808000 (Olive) - Heavily aged, potentially contaminated'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna) - Residue with embedded rust particles'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            if adhesive was fluid, and uniform coating where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often occur at the edges of the original tape application, in crevices,
            and where adhesive pooled due to gravity. Lighter concentrations are found in the center of the taped area.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - scattered streaks; Moderate (30-60%) - partial
            coverage with visible steel; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coverage; Extreme (>85%) - almost entirely covered.
          description: Adhesive residue on steel presents as a thin, often translucent or yellowish film, sometimes with iridescent
            patches. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape application.
            Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, streaked, or uniform depending on the tape type and application method. Often concentrated
            at the edges of where the tape was.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center may have
            a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and in any surface imperfections. Flat surfaces
            may exhibit a more uniform distribution.
          gravity_influence: Causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom of
            vertical surfaces. Can also lead to uneven distribution on inclined surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte. Iridescence
            may be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to smooth, then rough and brittle with age.
            May exhibit a crystalline or powdery surface due to degradation and oxidation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue).
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if the adhesive was liquid), small pools, crusts (aged residue), and
            irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare) to extremely non-uniform with distinct
            patches and streaks.
        stoneware:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and sticky. Over time, it darkens to a yellow-brown
            or brown color, hardens, and may become brittle, cracking or flaking off. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate
            this process.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation causes
            increased viscosity and tackiness. Weeks to months lead to hardening, discoloration, and potential cracking. Years
            result in a brittle, dark, and difficult-to-remove residue.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C08A medium yellow-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#B39769 dark yellow-brown (aged)'
          - '#826A47 dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and outlines mirroring the original
            tape shape. Residue often accumulates along edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            area, in corners, and within surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless multiple
            tape layers were applied or cleaning was ineffective.
          description: Adhesive residue on stoneware typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint, often exhibiting a patchy or streaked distribution pattern. The residue's color and texture
            vary depending on the adhesive type, age, and environmental exposure, ranging from a fresh, sticky film to a hardened,
            brittle crust.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was previously applied. Can also spread slightly
            beyond the original tape boundaries due to adhesive creep or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to surface tension effects during application and drying. The
            center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in recessed
            areas, along edges, and around raised features due to surface tension and capillary action.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive, resulting in
            thicker accumulations at the bottom of the tape application area. Pooling may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and hardens, the surface becomes
            more matte. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to smooth, then potentially rough, brittle, and crusty
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface with minute ridges and valleys. Some residues
            may exhibit a powdery or crystalline surface due to degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100-200 micrometers in areas of
            heavy accumulation or multiple tape applications.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (with age), and
            distinct patches mirroring the shape of the original tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly irregular patches and streaks.
        stucco:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears as a translucent or slightly yellowish film. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens, becomes more opaque, and may develop a brittle, cracked surface. Oxidation and UV exposure contribute
            to color changes and increased adhesion to dirt and debris.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, translucent film is deposited (hours/days). Over weeks/months, the residue
            becomes more opaque and may start to attract dirt and debris. After months/years, the residue darkens, hardens,
            and may develop a crusty or powdery surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (Translucent Yellowish-White, Fresh)'
          - '#E6D7B0 (Pale Yellow, Slightly Aged)'
          - '#D4C18F (Tan, Moderately Aged)'
          - '#B39769 (Light Brown, Aged)'
          - '#826A47 (Dark Brown, Heavily Aged/Oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, rectangular outlines (tape footprint), drip marks (if applied vertically),
            and halo effects around the perimeter of the original tape.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application, as well as in crevices and surface irregularities of the stucco. Lighter concentrations are found
            on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), depending on the original tape application and the amount of
            adhesive transferred. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare, but possible with repeated applications or very aggressive
            adhesives.
          description: Adhesive residue on stucco presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent
            to opaque. The color varies depending on the adhesive type and age, typically appearing as yellowish or brownish
            stains against the stucco's base color, often concentrated in irregular patches or streaks. Coverage is typically
            localized to the area where the adhesive tape was applied.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular or square outlines corresponding to tape dimensions, irregular patches, streaks
            running vertically (if applied on a vertical surface), and halo effects around the edges of the original adhesive
            application.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges, with higher concentrations of residue typically found along the perimeter of
            the original tape application. The center often has a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in crevices,
            indentations, and along edges. Rough stucco textures provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive, resulting in
            thicker deposits at the bottom of the application area. Pooling may occur in horizontal crevices or indentations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or have a dull appearance due to surface degradation and accumulation of dirt. The contrast between the
            residue and the stucco is more pronounced under oblique lighting.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery
            surface as it ages and degrades. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of
            smoothness and embedded particulate matter from the stucco.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or multiple applications.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), crusts (aged residue), patches (irregular shapes),
            and pools (in surface depressions).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker deposits at the edges
            and corners of the original tape application and thinner films in the center.
        tantalum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears as a translucent or slightly opaque film. Over time (months/years), it darkens,
            becomes more opaque, and may crack or flake off, leaving behind a more concentrated and difficult-to-remove residue.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation increases
            viscosity. Weeks/months lead to hardening and discoloration. Years result in embrittlement, cracking, and increased
            difficulty in removal.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale goldenrod (fresh)'
          - '#DEB887 burlywood (slightly aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (heavily aged)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (oxidized/contaminated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, outlines of tape edges, streaks from adhesive transfer, and drip marks if the
            adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape outline, in crevices,
            and in areas where the tape was under higher pressure. Lighter concentrations are found in the center of the tape
            area.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (60-85%) coverage can occur in areas
            of repeated tape application or heavy adhesive use.
          description: Adhesive residue on tantalum presents as a thin, often patchy film with a dominant yellow-brown discoloration.
            The residue typically exhibits a non-uniform distribution, concentrating in areas where the adhesive tape was
            initially applied, leaving behind a visible outline or pattern. Over time, the residue can darken and become more
            brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread slightly due
            to pressure or temperature changes.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the tape outline due to pressure concentration and adhesive squeeze-out.
            The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid or semi-liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking
            or pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This is more pronounced with thicker adhesive layers.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery texture
            as it ages. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness,
            depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (in concave areas), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (uneven removal).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        teak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable, translucent, and often glossy. Aged residue (months/years)
            becomes brittle, opaque, darker in color, and attracts dust, resulting in a matte finish and a rougher texture.
            Cracking and flaking are common in aged residue.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, even film. Over weeks/months, oxidation, dust accumulation,
            and migration of adhesive components lead to increased thickness, discoloration, and a change in texture. After
            years, the residue becomes brittle, cracked, and heavily contaminated with environmental debris.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, minimal aging)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, slight oxidation)'
          - '#E3C16F Dark Khaki (moderate aging, dust accumulation)'
          - '#B8860B DarkGoldenrod (heavily aged, significant oxidation)'
          - '#8B4513 SaddleBrown (extreme aging, heavily contaminated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the direction of tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and a general film coating the teak surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at the edges of the original tape application, in corners, and in
            crevices. Lighter concentration on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, duration of application, and environmental
            conditions. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with prolonged exposure and multiple tape applications.
          description: Adhesive residue on teak typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in color from
            a pale yellow to a dark amber. Coverage varies from sparse spots to a near-continuous coating, often concentrated
            along edges and in crevices. The residue can appear glossy when fresh and matte as it ages, attracting dust and
            debris.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape application and
            in any surface imperfections (scratches, pores) of the teak.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent drying/curing
            processes. Center areas typically have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and depressions due to capillary action and reduced airflow.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulations
            at the bottom. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light. Aged residue is typically matte
            due to surface roughness and dust accumulation. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and embedded particles
            become more visible.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, crusty, or powdery texture as it dries and
            ages. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with embedded particles.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick buildup), with localized
            areas reaching up to 200 micrometers in crevices or drip formations.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in depressions, crusts formed by drying and
            oxidation, and patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films in some areas to highly concentrated
            and uneven deposits in others.
        tempered glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow, pliable, and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes
            darker (yellow to brown), brittle, harder to remove, and may exhibit cracking or crazing.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial adhesion (0-24 hours): Pliable, clear/yellowish film. Gradual hardening (1-7 days):
            Increased viscosity, slight discoloration. Significant hardening (1-4 weeks): Brittle texture, noticeable discoloration.
            Long-term aging (months/years): Darkening, cracking, increased difficulty of removal.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki) - Fresh residue, thin layer'
          - '#E3DAC9 (Almond) - Slightly aged, thicker layer'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan) - Moderately aged, exposed to UV'
          - '#A98D61 (Sandstone) - Heavily aged, oxidized'
          - '#8B4513 (SaddleBrown) - Carbonized/burnt residue (rare)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially applied, streaks from wiping or cleaning attempts, drip
            marks if the adhesive was liquid, and uniform coating if sprayed or spread.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners or crevices, and along vertical surfaces where gravity has caused pooling. Lighter concentrations are
            found in areas where the adhesive was thinly spread or wiped away.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - Isolated spots or faint streaks; Light (10-30%) - Scattered patches and streaks;
            Moderate (30-60%) - Significant coverage with visible patterns; Heavy (60-85%) - Near-complete coating with some
            bare areas; Extreme (>85%) - Almost entirely covered in adhesive residue.
          description: Adhesive residue on tempered glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a
            slight yellow or brown tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, frequently exhibiting
            streaks or localized buildup. The residue's appearance changes significantly with age, becoming more brittle and
            discolored.
          distribution_patterns:
          - Localized patches corresponding to tape placement
          - Streaks from wiping or adhesive flow
          - Edge buildup due to capillary action
          - Uniform film coating from spray application
          - Drip marks from vertical surfaces
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to capillary action and tape placement, but can also be uniform or
            concentrated in the center depending on the application method.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more
            residue due to capillary action. Textured surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion and buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational influence.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue often exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull,
            with reduced reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures depending on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick buildup), occasionally
            reaching 100-200 micrometers in extreme cases of adhesive pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, drip marks, pools of hardened adhesive, crusts formed by oxidation
            and drying, and cracked or crazed surfaces in aged residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, typically from spray application)
            to extremely non-uniform with distinct patches and streaks.
        terbium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is pliable and translucent. Aged residue (months/years) becomes darker,
            more opaque, brittle, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Oxidation of the adhesive components contributes to
            the color change and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (0-24 hours): Thin, sticky film. Days to weeks: Gradual drying and hardening.
            Months to years: Darkening, embrittlement, cracking, and potential oxidation, leading to a more visible and difficult-to-remove
            residue.'
          color_variations:
          - '#D4A373 (light tan, fresh)'
          - '#C29164 (yellowish-brown, slightly aged)'
          - '#A07045 (medium brown, moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 (saddle brown, aged)'
          - '#654321 (dark brown, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was applied, streaks from adhesive transfer during tape removal, drip
            marks if the adhesive was applied in liquid form, and a general film coating across the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application area, as well as in crevices or surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more
            uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, depending on the type of tape and application
            method. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare, usually only occurring in areas of extreme buildup or spillage.
          description: 'Adhesive residue on Terbium surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a yellowish-brown
            tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. Over time, the residue darkens and becomes more brittle, potentially
            developing a cracked or crazed appearance. The residue''s color is primarily #D4A373 (light tan) when fresh, shifting
            towards #8B4513 (saddle brown) as it ages.'
          distribution_patterns: Localized around the areas where adhesive tape was applied. Can also spread due to cleaning
            attempts, resulting in a thin, uneven film across a larger surface area.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the original tape application area, with a gradual thinning towards the center.
            However, the center may have a more uniform, albeit thinner, film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            edges, and surface imperfections. Raised areas may have less residue due to wiping or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity will cause downward flow and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces, resulting in vertical streaking.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull due to
            surface roughening and oxidation. Under oblique lighting, the cracked patterns become more pronounced.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture transitions to a smooth, glassy film. With age
            and oxidation, it becomes brittle, developing a rough, cracked, and sometimes powdery surface. Microscopic examination
            reveals potential crystalline structures forming within the aged residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 10 micrometers for a thin film, but can reach up to 50-100 micrometers
            in areas of concentrated buildup or drip marks.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in surface depressions, crusts forming
            on heavily aged residue, and patches of localized residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thicker deposits at the edges
            of the original tape application and thinner films spreading outwards.
        terracotta:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color, and often brittle or powdery. Dirt and debris become embedded, further darkening the
            residue.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, sticky film. Over weeks/months, the residue thickens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. After years, the residue becomes brittle, discolored,
            and difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Light Yellow, fresh residue)'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan, slightly aged)'
          - '#A0785A (Yellow-Brown, moderately aged)'
          - '#8B4513 (Saddle Brown, heavily aged/oxidized)'
          - '#604020 (Dark Brown, dirt-embedded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks from adhesive flow, and uniform coatings
            where tape was fully adhered.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of previous tape placement, in
            corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) are the most common coverage ranges. Extreme coverage (>85%) is
            rare, usually only occurring where tape was heavily applied and left for extended periods.
          description: Adhesive residue on terracotta presents as a discolored film, ranging from translucent to opaque, with
            a dominant yellow-brown (#A0785A) hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting
            a streaky or patchy distribution pattern.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks, patches, outlines of previous tape placement, and localized spots are common. Residue
            tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and accumulation during tape application/removal.
            The center of the taped area may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions
            and along edges. Raised areas may exhibit minimal residue due to abrasion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. The presence of embedded particles can scatter light, creating a hazy
            appearance.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the residue transitions to a rough, sometimes crusty or powdery
            texture as it ages and degrades. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees
            of smoothness and embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 500 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Average
            thickness is typically between 10-100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces), pools in depressions, crusts formed
            by drying and oxidation, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform thin films (rare) to highly variable patches
            and streaks.
        thermoplastic elastomer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to amber or brown, becomes less tacky, and may develop a powdery or crusty surface due to oxidation and
            degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited. Over hours/days, the residue may redistribute
            slightly due to temperature changes or handling. Over weeks/months, oxidation and degradation lead to color changes,
            texture changes (tackiness decreases, powderiness increases), and potential for further redistribution due to
            environmental factors.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, minimal residue)'
          - '#F5DEB3 wheat (slightly aged, common)'
          - '#E9C46A dark khaki (moderate aging)'
          - '#D4A373 camel (significant aging, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and uniform coating (if tape was
            applied across the entire surface). Residue often concentrates along the edges of where the tape was applied.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in crevices or surface imperfections, and in areas where the adhesive pooled during application or removal. Flat
            surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but thinner, layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type, application pressure, and removal
            technique. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or improper removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on TPE surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a
            faint yellowish tint to a more pronounced amber color. Coverage varies from sparse, localized spots to a more
            uniform coating, often exhibiting a slightly tacky or glossy appearance initially, evolving to a matte or even
            slightly powdery texture with age.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, edge concentrations, uniform films, and streaking patterns are common. The
            distribution is heavily influenced by the tape application method and the TPE surface texture.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to stress concentration during tape removal, leading to tearing and
            leaving more residue at the perimeter. The center may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to stress concentration during tape
            removal. Concave surfaces may trap adhesive, leading to thicker deposits. Textured surfaces provide more surface
            area for adhesive to adhere to, resulting in more persistent residue.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downward, resulting in drip marks and
            thicker accumulations at the bottom edge of the tape application area. Pooling may occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or have a dull appearance. The gloss level decreases with increasing age and degradation of the adhesive.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a less tacky, sometimes powdery or crusty
            texture with age and exposure to environmental factors. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly uneven surface
            with small ridges or valleys depending on the adhesive type and application method.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the adhesive type, application pressure,
            and removal method. Thicker deposits can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas where adhesive pooled or was heavily
            applied.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in surface depressions, crusts (with
            aged residue), and patches of varying thickness and color.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare, usually with specialized adhesive
            application) to highly variable, with thick and thin patches, streaks, and localized concentrations.
        tin:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes brittle, darker in color, and
            more difficult to remove. Oxidation can lead to a matte finish and increased hardness.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin film (within hours). Over days, the residue may spread slightly
            due to temperature and humidity. Over months, oxidation and hardening occur, leading to a darker, more brittle
            film. Years of exposure can result in significant discoloration and embrittlement.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-beige (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4C18F medium yellow-brown (moderately aged)'
          - '#B39768 dark yellow-brown (aged)'
          - '#826A47 dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, streaks from tape removal, and uniform coating
            where the tape was fully adhered. Drip marks may be present if the adhesive was applied in liquid form or softened
            by heat.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at the edges of the original tape application, in corners, and
            in crevices. Lighter concentrations on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the tape type, application method, and removal process.
          description: Adhesive residue on tin presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original tape's adhesive
            type and application pressure. Over time, oxidation and environmental factors can darken and harden the residue.
          distribution_patterns: Spotty, streaked, or uniform films. Concentrated at edges of previous tape application. May
            follow the contours of the underlying tin surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and residue remaining
            after tape removal. Center coverage depends on the tape type and application pressure.
          geometry_effects: Adhesive tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and recessed areas due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Flat surfaces receive a more uniform coating.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of liquid adhesive or softened residue, leading to pooling at the bottom of vertical
            surfaces and vertical streaking. Gravity also contributes to the formation of drip marks.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue typically has a matte finish.
            Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film with potential for
            cracking or crazing upon aging. May exhibit a slightly rough texture due to particulate matter embedded within
            the adhesive.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations at edges or where adhesive
            pooled.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (at edges or low points), crusts (with age
            and oxidation), and patches (where tape was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly non-uniform accumulations
            with significant thickness variations.
        titanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellowish and sticky. Over time (months/years), it darkens
            to brown or dark brown, becomes brittle, and may exhibit signs of oxidation and degradation, leading to a powdery
            or crusty appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) is a thin, uniform film. Over weeks/months, residue thickens and
            darkens, especially at edges and in crevices. After years, residue becomes brittle, oxidized, and may flake off,
            leaving behind a stained surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFFFF translucent (fresh)'
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (slightly aged)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (extremely aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks, and thin films are common. Residue tends to accumulate in
            crevices and along edges.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage are
            rare and typically localized to areas where tape was repeatedly applied or residue was not properly removed.
          description: Adhesive residue on titanium presents as a thin, often iridescent film with localized areas of thicker,
            discolored buildup. The residue typically exhibits a non-uniform distribution, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, ranging from sparse to moderate coverage. Color varies from translucent to yellowish-brown.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with variations dependent on the application method of the tape and subsequent
            environmental factors. Common patterns include edge effects, pooling in low-lying areas, and streaking from wiping
            or cleaning attempts.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the adhesive's tendency to spread outwards from the tape's edge. Center
            areas typically have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and features (e.g., grooves, holes) significantly influence residue distribution.
            Residue tends to accumulate in valleys and around protrusions.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive. On horizontal
            surfaces, it leads to pooling and more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit iridescence due to thin-film interference. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or have a dull sheen. Lighting angle significantly affects visibility.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and smooth, transitioning to a rough, crusty, or powdery texture with age and
            oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees of crystallinity depending
            on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, with thicker accumulations reaching up to 100 micrometers
            in localized areas.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (vertical surfaces), pools (horizontal surfaces), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from near-perfect uniformity in thin films to extreme non-uniformity
            in areas with accumulated residue.
        titanium alloy (ti-6al-4v):
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and pliable. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker, and more brittle, often exhibiting cracking and flaking. Oxidation of the residue can also occur,
            leading to further discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape application. Over hours/days, the adhesive may
            spread slightly. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens and oxidizes, becoming more difficult to remove. Years
            of exposure can lead to significant discoloration and embrittlement.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#DEB887 burly wood (moderately aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (residue with embedded particulate)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to adhesive contact points, streaks from tape removal, and drip marks
            if the adhesive was applied in liquid form. Edge effects are common due to tape overlap.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges where tape overlapped, in corners
            where residue accumulated, and in crevices where cleaning was less effective. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner,
            more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) are the most common coverage ranges. Extreme coverage (>85%) is
            rare unless the entire surface was intentionally coated with adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on Ti-6Al-4V presents as a thin, often patchy film with a dominant yellow-brown hue.
            Coverage varies significantly, ranging from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the original
            tape application. Over time, the residue darkens and may become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, edge effects, and areas of pooling are common. The distribution
            is highly dependent on the type of tape used and the method of application/removal.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to tape overlap and difficulty in cleaning these areas. The center of a
            surface may have a thinner, more uniform coating if the tape was applied evenly.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners,
            crevices, and around edges. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is also common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. The presence
            of embedded particulate can reduce reflectivity further.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rougher, sometimes powdery or crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of adhesion to the titanium
            substrate.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm to 50 μm, with thicker accumulations at edges or in areas of pooling.
            Thicker residues can reach up to 100 μm.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in low-lying areas, crusts formed
            by aged and oxidized residue, and patches corresponding to the original tape contact area.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        titanium carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes hard, brittle, and may crack
            or flake off. Color darkens significantly with oxidation and UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue begins to dry
            and thicken, especially at edges. After weeks, the residue becomes brittle and may crack. After months, oxidation
            and UV exposure cause significant darkening and embrittlement.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD lemon chiffon (fresh)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (slightly aged)'
          - '#E3C16F dark khaki (moderately aged)'
          - '#B8860B darkgoldenrod (heavily aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (extremely aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and a general film
            coating. Fingerprints and other surface contaminants can influence the residue's distribution.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape footprint, in corners,
            and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless multiple
            layers of tape were applied or the residue was allowed to accumulate over extended periods.
          description: Adhesive residue on Titanium Carbide typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow
            or amber tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to moderate coatings, often concentrated along edges and corners.
            Over time, it can darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, influenced by surface energy and tape application pressure. Concentrated at
            edges, corners, and areas where the tape was initially applied with greater force.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and increased surface area for adhesion.
            The center of the tape footprint often has a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action and increased
            surface area. Surface roughness also increases residue adhesion.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive residue, leading
            to thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling can occur on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull, with reduced
            reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and cracking become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery
            texture as it ages and dries. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures forming within the residue.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, but can reach up to 20 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or buildup.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (around edges
            of dried residue), and patches (where tape was unevenly applied).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from near-perfect uniformity in thin films to significant variations
            in thickness and coverage in areas of buildup.
        titanium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent film. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            darker, more opaque, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Carbonization can occur with prolonged exposure to heat
            or UV light, resulting in a dark brown or black discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform film is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue begins to aggregate
            and thicken at edges and corners. After weeks, oxidation and polymerization cause the residue to darken and become
            more brittle. After months, carbonization may occur, resulting in a dark, tenacious deposit.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2E7D5 cream-white (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#E6C377 pale yellow-brown (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4A33D amber (moderately aged, thicker)'
          - '#B7791F dark amber (heavily aged, concentrated)'
          - '#664D03 dark brown (carbonized residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks are common, often originating from the edges of the tape. Drip marks
            may be present on vertical surfaces, indicating gravitational flow of the adhesive.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges, corners, and crevices. Lighter concentration on flat surfaces,
            often appearing as a faint haze.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (>60%) coverage can occur in localized
            areas.
          description: Adhesive residue on TiN typically appears as a hazy, iridescent film with localized, darker patches
            of concentrated adhesive. The dominant colors range from a faint yellow-brown to a more pronounced amber, often
            exhibiting interference patterns due to thin-film effects.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is typical. Residue tends to accumulate at the edges of the original
            tape application area, along scratches or surface defects, and in areas where the tape was under higher pressure.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and stress concentration during tape removal.
            The center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action and increased
            surface area. Concave surfaces trap residue more effectively than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of the adhesive, resulting in drip marks on vertical surfaces and
            pooling in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen and iridescence due to thin-film
            interference. Aged residue tends to be more matte and less reflective. Grazing incidence lighting highlights the
            surface irregularities and texture.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the residue transitions to a more brittle and crusty texture
            as it ages and oxidizes. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with areas of smooth film and areas
            of aggregated, particulate matter.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue varies from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, with thicker accumulations occurring
            at edges and in crevices.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in low-lying areas, thin films covering large areas,
            crusts forming at the edges of deposits, and patches of aggregated residue.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible thin films to localized, thick deposits.
        tool steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow and sticky. Aged residue (months/years)
            darkens to brown or amber, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. It also attracts and traps dirt and debris,
            further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even layer (0-24 hours). Over days, the adhesive may flow
            slightly, concentrating at edges and low points. After weeks, oxidation and hardening begin. After months, the
            residue becomes brittle, attracts dirt, and may crack or flake off. Years of exposure lead to significant degradation
            and potential corrosion of the underlying steel.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD (Lemon Chiffon - Fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki - Slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 (BurlyWood - Moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna - Heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 (DimGray - Contaminated with dirt/debris)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the direction of tape removal, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and uniform coatings where the tape was fully adhered. Fingerprints or other surface contaminants may be embedded
            within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating. Areas where the tape was
            under tension may have less residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - scattered streaks; Moderate (30-60%) - partial
            coating with visible steel; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coating with some steel visible; Extreme (>85%) - complete
            coating, obscuring the steel surface.
          description: Adhesive residue on tool steel typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a faint
            yellow to a brownish hue. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting streaks
            and pooling due to the adhesive's viscous nature. The residue can be sticky when fresh, becoming hardened and
            brittle with age.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks from tape removal, localized spots where adhesive remained after tape removal, pooling
            in low-lying areas or surface imperfections, and uniform films where the tape was fully adhered.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to adhesive bleed during tape application and removal. The center
            may have a more uniform, thinner coating if the tape was applied evenly.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects. Recessed
            areas and grooves trap residue, making removal more difficult. Smooth surfaces tend to have more uniform coatings.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes the adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks
            and thicker accumulations at the bottom. Pooling occurs in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull due
            to surface oxidation and contamination. The thickness of the residue influences the degree of sheen.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and pliable, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film. With age and exposure,
            it can become brittle, cracked, and exhibit a slightly rough, uneven surface. Microscopic examination may reveal
            a crystalline or amorphous structure depending on the adhesive type.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue). Extreme
            cases of buildup can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged, hardened
            residue), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (rare) to highly non-uniform with significant
            variations in thickness and coverage.
        travertine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellow, sticky, and easily smeared. Aged
            residue (months/years) darkens to amber or brown, becomes brittle, and is more difficult to remove. Oxidation
            and UV exposure contribute to discoloration and hardening.
          buildup_progression: Initially (hours/days), a thin, sticky film is present. Over weeks/months, the residue hardens
            and darkens due to oxidation and UV exposure. After months/years, the residue becomes brittle, discolored, and
            more difficult to remove, often incorporating dirt and dust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2F0E6 translucent off-white (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8A7 pale yellow (slightly aged)'
          - '#D4B46E amber (moderately aged)'
          - '#B78733 dark amber (heavily aged)'
          - '#966919 brownish-amber (oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include rectangular outlines corresponding to the original tape shape, irregular
            patches, and streaks where the adhesive was smeared during removal. Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces
            due to adhesive flow before curing.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges and corners of the original tape
            application, as well as in crevices and surface imperfections of the travertine. Flat surfaces tend to have a
            thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges can vary widely, from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type,
            application duration, and removal method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in cases of extensive tape
            use and poor removal practices.
          description: Adhesive residue on travertine presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from a faint yellowish
            tint to a more pronounced amber hue, often concentrated in areas where the adhesive tape was initially applied.
            The residue typically exhibits a patchy distribution, mirroring the original tape pattern, and can appear glossy
            or matte depending on the adhesive type and age.
          distribution_patterns: Rectangular outlines, edge concentrations, smeared trails, and localized patches are common.
            The distribution directly reflects the initial tape application and removal process.
          edge_center_behavior: The residue typically prefers edges, where the tape was initially adhered and where adhesive
            tends to accumulate during removal. The center of the taped area often has a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences the distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and in corners. Rough surfaces provide more surface area for adhesion, leading to greater residue
            retention.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of uncured adhesive, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform distribution, although pooling can still
            occur in low spots.
          lighting_effects: Under direct lighting, fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to
            be more matte, especially if it has accumulated dust or dirt. The residue's translucency can cause subtle variations
            in the travertine's underlying color.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, the residue transitions to a more rigid and sometimes brittle
            texture with age. It can range from smooth and glassy to rough and crusty, depending on the adhesive composition
            and environmental factors. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly crystalline or powdery surface.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200
            micrometers in areas of heavy accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions,
            and crusts or patches where the adhesive has accumulated and hardened.
          uniformity_assessment: The residue distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically highly variable, with
            thicker deposits at the edges of the original tape and thinner films in the center.
        tungsten:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and tacky. Aged residue darkens to brown or dark
            brown, becomes brittle, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation can further darken the residue, leading to a burnt
            appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initially a thin, even layer (hours). Over days, solvent evaporation leads to increased viscosity
            and tackiness. Over weeks/months, oxidation and polymerization cause hardening, darkening, and increased brittleness.
            Dust and debris accumulation further contribute to buildup over longer periods (years).

          - '#654321 dark brown (oxidized/burnt)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a thin, uneven film. Fingerprints
            and tape outlines are frequently visible.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges of tape lines, corners, and in surface imperfections.
            Lighter concentrations on flat, smooth surfaces. Crevices and scratches act as collection points for the residue.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless multiple
            layers of tape were applied or cleaning was inadequate.
          description: Adhesive residue on tungsten typically presents as a thin, translucent film with a slight yellow or
            brown tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. Over time, it can darken and become more brittle, leaving
            behind a sticky or crusty surface. The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at edges, corners, and areas where the adhesive was
            initially applied. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Residue often conforms to the underlying
            surface texture of the tungsten.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension effects during adhesive
            application and drying. The center of a taped area may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in valleys
            and along edges, while peaks may have minimal coverage. Sharp corners and edges act as nucleation sites for buildup.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow and streaking of the adhesive. Pooling may
            occur at the bottom of vertical surfaces or in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, transitioning to a rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery
            texture as it ages and dries. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and roughness. Some areas may exhibit a crystalline structure due to adhesive component separation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers (fresh) to 5-50 micrometers (aged, built-up). In extreme
            cases, buildup can reach several hundred micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pools (in depressions), crusts (aged residue),
            and patches (where tape was applied). Microscopic examination may reveal the formation of small crystals or agglomerates.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible thin films to thick, localized deposits.
        tungsten carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically pliable and translucent. Aged residue (months/years) darkens,
            hardens, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (minutes/hours) is a thin, uniform film. Over days/weeks, solvent evaporation
            and crosslinking occur, increasing hardness and decreasing tackiness. Over months/years, oxidation, UV degradation,
            and particulate accumulation lead to darkening, embrittlement, and increased thickness.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, more aged)'
          - '#B8860B ''DarkGoldenrod'' (moderate aging, thicker deposit)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, oxidized)'
          - '#696969 ''DimGray'' (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks from tape removal, drip marks if applied in liquid form, and uniform coatings
            where tape was fully adhered. Fingerprints and other handling marks are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations often occur at edges and corners due to capillary action and pooling.
            Crevices and surface imperfections also tend to accumulate more residue. Flat surfaces generally have thinner,
            more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; Light (10-30%) - scattered streaks and patches; Moderate (30-60%)
            - partial coating with visible tungsten carbide; Heavy (60-85%) - near-complete coating; Extreme (>85%) - thick,
            obscuring layer.
          description: Adhesive residue on tungsten carbide typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film, often
            exhibiting a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced
            by the adhesive type and application method. Aged residue tends to darken and become more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, uniform coatings, edge accumulation, and patterns mirroring the
            original tape application.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges due to capillary action and tape application methods. Center coverage
            depends on the tape type and pressure applied during adhesion.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects. Rough
            surfaces provide more anchor points for adhesive, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow and pooling are observed with liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking
            on vertical surfaces and thicker deposits at the bottom of surfaces. Gravity also influences the settling of particulate
            matter within the residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Interference
            fringes (iridescence) can be observed in very thin films due to light interference.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, glassy or slightly rough texture
            upon drying. Aged residue can become brittle, crusty, or powdery, depending on the adhesive composition and environmental
            conditions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 micrometers (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, built-up residue).
            In extreme cases, pooled or dripped residue can reach thicknesses of several hundred micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools in surface depressions, crusts formed
            by drying and oxidation, and patches where tape was partially adhered.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare) to highly non-uniform with distinct
            variations in thickness and coverage.
        urethane composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and highly tacky. Over time (months/years), it
            darkens, becomes brittle, and loses its adhesive properties, transitioning to a more solid, crusty, or powdery
            state. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate this process.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, tackiness decreases, and dust/debris
            adhere. After months, oxidation and hardening occur, leading to crust formation. Years of exposure result in a
            brittle, powdery residue that is difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 pale yellow-white (fresh)'
          - '#E6D8B0 light beige (slightly aged)'
          - '#D1BFA0 tan (moderately aged)'
          - '#B39570 light brown (aged)'
          - '#806449 dark brown (heavily aged/oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where the tape was initially adhered, streaks resulting from tape removal, and
            drip marks if the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state. Fingerprints and other handling marks
            are often visible within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and within surface crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the initial tape application
            and subsequent cleaning efforts. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common.
          description: Adhesive residue on urethane composites typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with
            a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to extensive coatings, influenced by the tape's
            original application and removal method. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized to areas where tape was applied. Can also spread due to cleaning attempts
            or environmental factors. Often concentrated along edges of the original tape footprint.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue accumulation
            during tape removal. The center often has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in recessed
            areas, along edges, and around protrusions. Complex geometries lead to more uneven distribution.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause downward flow of liquid or semi-liquid adhesives, resulting in vertical streaking
            or pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with fresh residue.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss, especially under direct lighting. As it ages
            and becomes more matte, the sheen diminishes. Heavily oxidized residue appears dull and absorbs light.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, the texture evolves to become less adhesive and more crusty
            or powdery with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the residue varies significantly, ranging from sub-micrometer films (0.1-1 μm)
            to thicker accumulations (10-50 μm) in areas where the adhesive pooled or was applied heavily. Extreme cases can
            reach up to 100 μm.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools (in depressions), thin films (spread across the surface),
            crusts (aged and hardened residue), and patches (unevenly distributed residue).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform. Depends on tape application pressure, adhesive
            type, and removal technique.
        vanadium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue appears as a translucent, slightly tacky film. Aged residue darkens, becomes more
            opaque, and may crack or flake off. Oxidation of the Vanadium underneath can contribute to a reddish-brown discoloration
            around the residue perimeter.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even layer is deposited (hours). Over days, the residue begins to crosslink
            and harden. After months, it becomes brittle, discolored, and may start to flake off, leaving behind a more tenacious,
            chemically bonded layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C pale goldenrod (fresh)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (moderately aged)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (heavily aged)'
          - '#800080 purple (iridescent sheen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks corresponding to the original tape application. Often exhibits a 'ghosting'
            effect where the tape edges were.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application
            and in any crevices or surface imperfections. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more even coating.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy coverage unless multiple
            layers of tape were applied.
          description: Adhesive residue on Vanadium presents as a mottled, iridescent film with dominant hues of amber and
            grey. Coverage is typically localized, following the original tape pattern, and can range from sparse to moderate.
            Over time, the residue darkens and becomes more brittle.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where adhesive tape was previously applied. Can follow straight lines,
            curves, or irregular shapes depending on the tape's original configuration.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application. The center of the taped
            area typically has a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and surface depressions due to capillary action
            and the tape's inability to conform perfectly to sharp angles.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, residue may exhibit downward flow patterns, resulting in vertical streaking
            and pooling at the bottom edge of the original tape application. Horizontal surfaces will show more even distribution
            within the taped area.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight gloss, while aged residue tends to be matte. Iridescence is often
            observed due to thin-film interference effects, particularly in areas with varying residue thickness.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rough, brittle, and sometimes powdery
            texture with age. Microscopic examination reveals a network of fractured polymer strands.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm to 50 μm, with thicker accumulations near tape edges or areas of pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, localized patches, and occasional drip marks if the surface was vertical during
            tape removal. Crusting may occur with prolonged exposure to air and humidity.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Thickness and color are rarely uniform, even within a small area. Variations
            are influenced by the tape's adhesive properties, pressure applied during application, and environmental factors.
        walnut:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often translucent and sticky, becoming more opaque, yellowed, and brittle over
            time. Aged residue may exhibit cracking, flaking, and increased discoloration due to oxidation and UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over hours/days, the solvent evaporates, increasing
            the adhesive concentration. Over weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure lead to discoloration and embrittlement.
            Over years, the residue can become deeply embedded in the wood grain, making removal difficult.
          color_variations:
          - '#F5F5DC beige-white (fresh, low tack)'
          - '#E0C2A3 light tan (slightly aged)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#C0995F dark tan/light brown (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (very old, deeply embedded)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots corresponding to tape contact points, linear streaks from tape removal, drip marks
            if the adhesive was fluid, and a general film-like coating in the area of application.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the tape application area,
            in corners, and in crevices of the walnut's grain. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but thinner, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) unless multiple layers of tape
            were applied or the adhesive was particularly aggressive.
          description: Adhesive residue on walnut presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte film, ranging from translucent
            to opaque. It typically appears as localized spots or streaks, with color variations depending on the adhesive
            type and age, contrasting against the walnut's natural grain. The residue's coverage varies from sparse to moderate,
            often concentrated in areas where the tape was initially applied.
          distribution_patterns: Localized to areas where tape was applied, often following the shape of the tape. Can also
            spread slightly beyond the tape's original boundaries due to adhesive flow or transfer.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and subsequent drying. The
            center area under the tape tends to have a more uniform, thinner coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in depressions,
            along edges, and in corners. Raised areas may have less residue due to wiping or abrasion.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in a liquid or semi-liquid state, gravity will cause downward flow,
            resulting in drip marks and pooling at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight gloss or sheen, while aged residue tends to be matte. Under
            oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly pliable, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes brittle
            or powdery consistency with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of
            smoothness and roughness, depending on the adhesive type and degradation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), small pools in grain depressions, crusts (aged
            residue), and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly uniform thin films to highly concentrated spots and
            streaks.
        willow:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is pliable and easily smeared. Aged residue becomes brittle, hard, and may exhibit
            cracking or flaking. Color darkens significantly over time due to oxidation and UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initial application leaves a thin, even film (hours). Over days, the adhesive begins to cure
            and harden. After weeks/months, oxidation and UV exposure cause discoloration and embrittlement. Years later,
            the residue becomes a hard, dark, and often cracked crust.
          color_variations:
          - '#F2EBD3 (Fresh, translucent yellowish-white)'
          - '#E6D8B0 (Slightly aged, pale yellow)'
          - '#D1C08E (Moderately aged, light tan)'
          - '#B3976A (Heavily aged, brownish-yellow)'
          - '#997B4F (Very old, dark brown)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks aligned with the willow grain, drip marks (if applied vertically), and
            pooling in depressions.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and within crevices of the willow's surface. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape and the duration of its application.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless multiple layers of tape were applied.
          description: Adhesive residue on willow presents as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to near-complete coating, following the grain and texture of the willow.
            The residue tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily follows the contours of the willow surface, concentrating in areas where the adhesive
            was initially applied or where it flowed due to gravity or capillary action.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges initially, then spreads towards the center. Edges often have a thicker buildup.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to surface tension effects. Concave
            surfaces may exhibit pooling, while convex surfaces may have thinner coatings.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and thicker accumulations
            at the bottom. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged residue tends to be matte
            or have a dull appearance. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a dry, rough, and sometimes crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in areas of pooling
            or heavy application.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts (with age),
            and fragmented patches where the residue has detached from the surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven
            deposits.
        yttria-stabilized zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is typically clear or slightly yellow and pliable. Over time (weeks to months), it
            darkens, hardens, and may become brittle, developing a matte finish and potentially cracking or flaking. Oxidation
            and UV exposure accelerate degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup occurs immediately upon tape removal, leaving a thin, uniform layer. Over the
            next few hours to days, the residue may redistribute slightly due to surface tension and environmental factors.
            Over weeks to months, the residue hardens, oxidizes, and may attract dust and debris, increasing its visibility
            and altering its texture.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, thicker layer)'
          - '#DEB887 BurlyWood (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots where tape was initially adhered, streaks from wiping or partial removal, and drip
            marks if solvent-based adhesives were used. Fingerprints and other handling marks are often visible within the
            residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration at edges and corners of the original tape application, in crevices,
            and around surface scratches. Lighter concentration on flat, polished surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) is most common. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the entire
            surface was intentionally coated with adhesive.
          description: Adhesive residue on YSZ appears as a translucent to opaque film, often with a yellowish or brownish
            tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, influenced by the tape's adhesive type and
            removal method. The residue tends to accumulate in surface imperfections and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with higher concentrations at the edges of the original tape footprint and in
            surface defects. Often exhibits a 'halo' effect around the perimeter of the original adhesive area.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to the 'edge effect' during tape application and removal, leading to higher
            residue concentration at the perimeter of the taped area. Center areas tend to have less residue unless the tape
            was damaged or unevenly applied.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to capillary action and increased
            surface area for adhesion. Concave surfaces may trap residue more effectively than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow and pooling are evident with liquid or semi-liquid adhesives, resulting in thicker
            deposits at the bottom of vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, especially under oblique lighting. Aged residue
            tends to be matte, scattering light diffusely. Interference fringes (iridescence) may be observed in very thin
            films.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a smooth, hardened film or a powdery, crusty
            texture with age and exposure to air. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 micrometers, but can reach up to 50 micrometers in areas of heavy
            accumulation or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive), pools in surface depressions, crusts along edges,
            and patchy coverage where tape was unevenly applied or removed.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from near-perfect uniformity in spin-coated applications (uncommon)
            to highly irregular distributions in hand-applied tape scenarios.
        yttrium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and pliable. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            more opaque, brittle, and may exhibit discoloration due to oxidation or UV degradation. Cracking and flaking are
            also common in aged samples.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited. Over time (hours/days), gravity and surface tension
            cause the adhesive to flow and pool, resulting in thicker accumulations at edges and in crevices. As the adhesive
            ages (weeks/months), it hardens and may crack or flake, further altering the distribution pattern.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, aged a few days)'
          - '#E3C16F ''Dark Khaki'' (moderate thickness, aged weeks)'
          - '#B8860B ''DarkGoldenrod'' (thick, aged months, oxidized)'
          - '#8B4513 ''SaddleBrown'' (heavily aged, degraded adhesive)'
          common_patterns: Streaks, drip marks, localized spots, and edge buildup are common. Uniform coatings are rare, typically
            only occurring with very thin, deliberately applied layers. Fingerprints or other transfer patterns may also be
            visible.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and pooling. Flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more even coatings, although streaks and variations are
            still present.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the application method and
            the amount of adhesive used. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare unless the entire surface was intentionally coated.
          description: Adhesive residue on Yttrium surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, ranging from
            a faint yellowish tint to a more pronounced amber hue. Coverage can vary from sparse, localized spots to a more
            uniform coating, often exhibiting streaks and drip marks indicative of the adhesive's initial application and
            subsequent flow.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, edge buildup, and drip marks are the most common distribution patterns
            on Yttrium surfaces.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to capillary action and surface tension effects. The center
            of flat surfaces tends to have a thinner, less concentrated layer of residue.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in concave areas
            (e.g., corners, grooves) and thin out on convex surfaces. Edges and sharp corners act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the formation of drip marks and pooling. Vertical surfaces
            exhibit downward flow, resulting in streaks and thicker accumulations at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces tend
            to exhibit more uniform pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light specularly. Aged residue tends
            to be matte or dull, with reduced reflectivity. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and thickness variations
            become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture transitions to a more rigid, sometimes crusty
            or powdery feel as the adhesive ages and degrades. Microscopic examination reveals a non-crystalline, amorphous
            structure with varying degrees of surface roughness depending on the adhesive type and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 0.5 micrometers (very thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, pooled residue).
            Average thickness is typically between 2 and 15 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), pools (localized accumulations), thin films (uniform or streaky),
            crusts (thick, hardened layers), and patches (irregularly shaped areas of coverage) are typical formations.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Perfect uniformity is extremely rare. The residue's distribution is heavily
            influenced by the application method and surface topography.
        zinc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically clear or slightly yellowish, tacky, and easily smeared.
            Aged residue (months/years) darkens, becomes brittle, less tacky, and more difficult to remove. It also tends
            to attract and trap dirt and debris, further altering its appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial application (0-24 hours): Thin, tacky film. Days 1-7: Adhesive begins to dry and harden,
            becoming less tacky. Weeks 1-4: Residue becomes more brittle and starts to attract dirt. Months 1-12: Residue
            darkens and oxidizes, becoming more difficult to remove. Years 1+: Residue becomes heavily encrusted with dirt
            and corrosion products, forming a hard, discolored layer.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F0E68C (Khaki) - Fresh residue, thin layer'
          - '#E3D5A3 (Pale Goldenrod) - Slightly aged, thicker layer'
          - '#C2B280 (Sand) - Moderately aged, oxidized'
          - '#A08A5F (Olive Drab) - Heavily aged, dirt accumulation'
          - '#806517 (Dark Khaki) - Residue with embedded corrosion products'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, ghosted outlines of the tape, drip marks (if adhesive was applied in
            liquid form), and a general film covering the affected area.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found along the edges of where the tape was applied,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - Isolated spots or streaks. Light (10-30%) - Thin film with visible zinc surface.
            Moderate (30-60%) - Partial coverage with some areas of bare zinc. Heavy (60-85%) - Almost complete coverage with
            thick residue. Extreme (>85%) - Complete coverage with very thick, built-up residue.
          description: Adhesive residue on zinc surfaces typically presents as a translucent to opaque film, often exhibiting
            a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse to heavy, depending on the tape type and removal method,
            with a tendency to concentrate along edges and corners. The residue often appears as a ghosted outline of the
            original tape.
          distribution_patterns: Ghosted outlines of tape, localized spots where adhesive was concentrated, streaks from wiping
            or cleaning attempts, and a general film covering the affected area.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive flow and pooling during application and drying. The center area
            typically has a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more residue due to the adhesive's tendency to flow and pool
            in these areas. Surface irregularities can also trap residue, leading to localized buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause liquid adhesive to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced with freshly applied adhesive.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to
            be matte due to surface oxidation and dirt accumulation. The residue's translucence allows the underlying zinc
            surface to influence its perceived color and brightness.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, the texture evolves to become less tacky and more powdery
            or crusty with age. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous surface with varying degrees of smoothness
            and roughness. Some residues may exhibit a slightly crystalline appearance under magnification.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (thin film) to 50 micrometers (thick, built-up residue). In
            extreme cases, particularly with aged or heavily applied adhesives, thicknesses can reach up to 200 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), pools of hardened adhesive, crusts of
            dried adhesive, and patches of varying thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The residue is rarely perfectly uniform, with thickness and concentration
            varying significantly across the surface.
        zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue is often clear or slightly yellow and sticky. Over time (months/years), it darkens
            to a brownish or amber color, becomes less tacky, and may crack or flake. Oxidation and UV exposure accelerate
            degradation.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, even film is deposited (hours). Over days, tackiness decreases and dust/debris
            adheres. After weeks/months, oxidation and degradation lead to discoloration, cracking, and flaking. Years of
            exposure result in a hardened, brittle residue that is difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD Lemon Chiffon (fresh, thin)'
          - '#F0E68C Khaki (slightly aged, thicker)'
          - '#B8860B DarkGoldenrod (moderately aged, oxidized)'
          - '#A0522D Sienna (heavily aged, degraded)'
          - '#696969 DimGray (contaminated with dust/debris)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, ghosted outlines of tape, drip marks (if applied vertically), and a general
            film coating. Often concentrated at the edges of where the tape was.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the original tape application,
            in corners, and in crevices. Flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the type of tape, application pressure, and removal
            method. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible with aggressive adhesives or improper removal.
          description: Adhesive residue on zirconia typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with a yellowish
            or brownish tint, often exhibiting irregular coverage patterns. The residue can range from a barely visible sheen
            to a noticeable, sticky layer, depending on the adhesive type and removal method. It often appears as a ghosted
            outline of the original tape.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, often mimicking the shape of the original adhesive tape. Can be patchy or streaky,
            with variations in thickness and concentration across the surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges due to adhesive squeeze-out during tape application and potential residue left
            behind during tape removal. The center may have a thinner, more uniform coating or be relatively clean.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Residue tends to accumulate in corners, edges,
            and recessed areas. Rough surfaces provide more anchor points for the adhesive.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity causes downward flow, resulting in drip marks and pooling at the
            bottom. Horizontal surfaces may exhibit more uniform distribution, but pooling can still occur in low spots.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged residue tends to be matte or dull. Under
            oblique lighting, the residue's texture and thickness variations become more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly tacky, transitioning to a more brittle, crusty, or powdery texture
            with age. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of roughness. Can also appear
            smooth if the adhesive has flowed and leveled out.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (on vertical surfaces), small pools in depressions, crusts around the
            edges of the original tape, and patches of residue where the tape was torn or removed unevenly.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly invisible, perfectly uniform films to highly localized
            and uneven deposits.
        zirconium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh residue (hours/days) is typically translucent and sticky. Aged residue (months/years) becomes
            opaque, darker in color, harder, and less tacky. It may also exhibit signs of oxidation or degradation, such as
            cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initially, a thin, uniform layer is deposited. Over hours/days, solvent evaporation causes
            the residue to become more viscous and concentrated. Over weeks/months, oxidation and polymerization lead to hardening,
            discoloration, and increased adhesion to the zirconium surface. After years, the residue may become brittle and
            prone to cracking or flaking.
          color_variations:
          - '#FFFACD ''Lemon Chiffon'' (fresh, thin layer)'
          - '#F0E68C ''Khaki'' (slightly thicker, newer residue)'
          - '#B8860B ''DarkGoldenrod'' (aged, oxidized residue)'
          - '#A0522D ''Sienna'' (heavily aged, potentially contaminated residue)'
          - '#696969 ''DimGray'' (residue with embedded particulate matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks corresponding to tape edges, irregular patches, and drip marks if the
            adhesive was applied in liquid form. Fingerprints or other surface contaminants may be embedded within the residue.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of the former tape location, in
            corners or crevices, and in areas where the tape was under greater pressure. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer of residue.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on the tape type and removal process. Extreme coverage
            (>85%) is rare but possible if the tape was left on for an extended period or if excessive adhesive was used.
          description: Adhesive residue on zirconium surfaces typically presents as a thin, translucent to opaque film with
            a yellowish or brownish tint. Coverage varies from sparse spots to near-complete coatings, often exhibiting irregular
            patterns due to the adhesive application method and subsequent removal of the tape. The residue can range from
            a sticky, slightly glossy appearance when fresh to a hardened, matte finish as it ages.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks along the direction of tape removal, localized spots where adhesive remained after
            tape removal, and pooling in surface imperfections. Edges of the former tape location are often clearly defined
            by a line of residue.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges of the former tape location due to adhesive squeeze-out and incomplete removal.
            The center of the taped area may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Residue tends to accumulate in recessed areas, corners, and along edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. Raised areas may have less residue due to easier removal during cleaning or tape removal.
          gravity_influence: If the adhesive was applied in liquid form, gravity will cause downward flow and pooling at the
            bottom of vertical surfaces, resulting in vertical streaking. Horizontal surfaces will exhibit more uniform distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh residue exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged residue tends to be
            matte or dull, with minimal reflectivity. The presence of embedded particles can scatter light, creating a hazy
            appearance.
          texture_details: Initially sticky and slightly glossy, transitioning to a rougher, matte, and sometimes crusty texture
            with age. Microscopic examination may reveal a network of fine cracks and fissures in the aged residue. The surface
            can feel tacky or have a slight drag when touched.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy
            buildup or pooling.
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if liquid adhesive was used), crusts (aged residue), patches of varying
            thickness, and distinct lines marking the edges of the tape.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (rare) to extremely non-uniform, depending
            on the tape type, application method, and removal process.

        alabaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days/weeks) is vibrant green and easily wiped away. Aged growth (months/years) becomes
            duller, more firmly attached, and may incorporate dirt and debris, resulting in a grayish-green or even blackish
            appearance. Lichen becomes more established and thicker over time.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (weeks) starts with faint green or gray patches. Algae spreads rapidly
            in moist conditions. Lichen establishes more slowly (months), forming visible crusts. Over years, the growth becomes
            thicker, darker, and more firmly attached, potentially causing staining and surface degradation.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CB342 olive-green (fresh algae)'
          - '#6D8B42 muted-green (aged algae)'
          - '#A3A186 grayish-green (lichen)'
          - '#808080 dark-gray (soiled lichen)'
          - '#D3CEC4 alabaster-base (unaffected)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, and a general darkening of the
            alabaster surface are common. The patterns are often dictated by the surface's micro-topography and exposure to
            moisture and sunlight.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with prolonged moisture exposure, such as near the base of
            structures, in crevices, or on north-facing surfaces. Lighter concentration on exposed, well-ventilated surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed areas to heavy (60-85%) or even extreme (>85%)
            in damp, shaded areas. Moderate (30-60%) coverage is common in moderately exposed environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on alabaster presents as a mottled, greenish-gray discoloration, often concentrated
            in areas with higher moisture retention. The growth typically starts as small, localized patches and expands over
            time, creating a visually uneven surface. Lichen appears more crust-like, while algae tends to be smoother and
            film-like.
          distribution_patterns: Patches, streaks, and overall darkening, often concentrated in shaded or damp areas. Lichen
            tends to form distinct, circular or irregular patches, while algae can spread more diffusely.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations of growth due to increased moisture
            retention and reduced sunlight exposure. Flat, central surfaces tend to have less growth.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and crevices tend to accumulate more moisture and therefore support heavier growth.
            Convex surfaces are generally less susceptible due to better drainage and sunlight exposure.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae spores and nutrients downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns.
            Pooling of water at the base of structures or in depressions promotes localized growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish when dry. Lichen
            generally has a matte appearance regardless of moisture levels. The overall effect is a reduction in the alabaster's
            natural luster.
          texture_details: Algae exhibits a smooth, sometimes slimy texture when fresh, transitioning to a slightly rough,
            matte finish as it dries. Lichen presents a crusty, granular texture, often with small, raised structures (apothecia)
            visible under magnification. Alabaster itself is smooth, but the growth introduces irregularities.
          thickness_range: Algae films typically range from 1-5 micrometers when fresh, increasing to 10-20 micrometers when
            aged. Lichen crusts can range from 50 micrometers to 1 millimeter, depending on the species and age.
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches (both), and streaks (following water runoff). Lichen
            can also form small, raised structures (apothecia) on its surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The growth is rarely uniform, with significant differences in coverage and
            thickness across the surface.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green or yellow film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Over
            months/years, it darkens to brown or gray, often accompanied by the development of lichen, which adds a crusty
            texture.
          buildup_progression: Initial algae colonization occurs within hours/days as a thin film. Over weeks/months, the
            algae layer thickens and darkens. Lichen colonization begins after several months, forming crusty patches that
            gradually expand over years.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#A0522D sienna brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#808000 olive (mixed algae/lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water flow, irregular patches, and sometimes a uniform coating
            in highly humid environments.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in areas with higher moisture levels, such
            as edges, corners, crevices, and shaded surfaces. Flat, exposed surfaces tend to have lighter growth.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on environmental conditions and surface characteristics.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on alumina presents as a mottled, multi-colored surface, ranging from vibrant
            greens and yellows to dull browns and grays. The growth often appears as localized patches or streaks, influenced
            by moisture and surface irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, irregular patches, uniform coating in humid environments.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to increased moisture retention
            and nutrient accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and porosity significantly influence growth. Algae and lichen colonize more
            readily in crevices and pores where moisture is retained.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae and lichen growth,
            especially on vertical alumina surfaces. Pooling can occur in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Lichen tends to be matte, with minimal light reflection.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (mature lichen). Algae
            often forms a thin, gelatinous film, while lichen develops a more complex, layered structure with visible thalli.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50-500 micrometers.'
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches, and drip marks following water runoff.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse and patchy to nearly uniform coverage depending on environmental
            conditions.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Over
            months, it darkens to brown and becomes more crusty. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months to years to
            establish visible thalli, which then gradually expand and thicken.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days/weeks, forming a thin film. Buildup progresses rapidly
            in favorable conditions, leading to visible patches within months. Lichen: Colonization starts with microscopic
            spores, taking months to years to establish visible thalli. Growth is slow but persistent, gradually expanding
            the colonized area over years.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'
          - '#808080 gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#A0522D sienna brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (weathered lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, uniform coating in humid environments,
            concentric rings around initial growth points.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, near joints or seams where moisture accumulates,
            and on surfaces with rougher textures that provide better adhesion. Lighter concentration on exposed, smooth,
            and frequently cleaned surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed environments. Light (10-30%) in moderately humid areas. Moderate
            (30-60%) in shaded, damp locations. Heavy (60-85%) in consistently wet environments. Extreme (>85%) in submerged
            or perpetually damp conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on aluminum presents as a mottled surface with shades of green, gray, and brown.
            Algae typically forms a slimy or powdery coating, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. Coverage ranges
            from sparse to heavy depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: Random, clustered, gradient (more growth in shaded/moist areas), edge-preferential (where
            moisture accumulates), drip patterns (following water runoff).
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often preferred due to moisture accumulation and protection from direct
            sunlight. Centers of large, flat surfaces may exhibit less growth initially, but can become colonized over time.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations of growth. Concave
            surfaces trap water and debris, promoting colonization. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to gravity-driven
            water flow.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of water creates streaks of algae and lichen. Pooling of water in depressions leads
            to localized concentrations. Vertical surfaces may show less lichen growth due to reduced water retention.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Fresh growth can have a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally
            matte, but some species may exhibit a slight gloss. Pitted aluminum underneath can scatter light.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially slimy, becoming powdery or granular when dry. Lichen: Crusty, foliose (leafy),
            or fruticose (shrub-like), ranging from smooth to rough depending on the species. Aluminum surface underneath
            can become pitted due to corrosion.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-100 micrometers (fresh film), up to 500 micrometers (dried crust). Lichen: 100 micrometers
            to 5 millimeters, depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, powdery deposits, gelatinous masses, drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, scales,
            leafy structures, shrub-like growths.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can be relatively uniform in consistently moist environments. Lichen
            is almost always non-uniform, forming distinct patches.
        ash:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh algae (hours/days): Bright green, slimy. Aged algae (weeks/months): Darker green to brownish,
            drier, potentially powdery. Lichen (months/years): Gray or brownish patches, increasing in size and complexity,
            with visible apothecia.'
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Rapid buildup (days-weeks) in favorable conditions, followed by potential die-off and
            recolonization. Lichen: Slow buildup (months-years), with gradual expansion of thallus and development of apothecia.'
          color_variations:
          - '#77DD77 light green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'

          - '#D2691E chocolate brown (lichen apothecia)'
          common_patterns: 'Algae: Uniform coating or localized spots, often concentrated in damp areas. Lichen: Localized
            patches, often radiating outwards from a central point. Streaks may occur due to water runoff.'
          concentration_variations: 'Algae: Heaviest in damp areas, edges, and crevices. Lichen: Can be heavier on flat surfaces
            or in areas sheltered from direct sunlight.'
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%), light (10-30%), moderate (30-60%), heavy (60-85%), extreme (>85%)
          description: Algae and lichen growth on ash surfaces present as a mottled, greenish-gray to brownish-orange coating.
            Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. Coverage ranges from
            sparse to heavy depending on environmental conditions and ash composition.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches, uniform coating, streaks, drip marks, concentrated in crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often prefers edges and crevices due to moisture retention. Lichen: Can colonize both
            edges and center, depending on species and microclimate.'
          geometry_effects: 'Algae: Accumulates in depressions and along edges. Lichen: Can conform to surface irregularities,
            with different species preferring different orientations (e.g., vertical vs. horizontal).'
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water can create streaks. Lichen: Less affected by gravity once established,
            but initial spore deposition may be influenced by wind and water.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Glossy when wet, matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, but apothecia may exhibit a
            slight sheen when fresh.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Smooth, slimy, sometimes powdery when dry. Lichen: Crusty, granular, leafy (foliose), or
            shrubby (fruticose), depending on the species. Apothecia (lichen fruiting bodies) can be smooth and disc-like
            or rough and granular.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 micrometers (fresh), up to 50 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 5 millimeters,
            depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, pools, patches. Lichen: Crusts, patches, leafy structures, shrubby structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: 'Algae: Can be relatively uniform in damp conditions, highly variable in drier conditions.
            Lichen: Highly variable, depending on species and substrate.'
        bamboo:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears bright green and moist, transitioning to darker green or brown as it dries
            and ages. Lichen color may fade slightly over time, and the texture can become more brittle.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days, noticeable film within weeks, significant buildup
            within months. Lichen: Colonization can take months to years, with visible patches developing over several years.'

          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged/dead algae and lichen)'
          common_patterns: 'Algae: Uniform coating or localized spots, often with streaks from water runoff. Lichen: Discrete
            patches, often circular or irregular, sometimes coalescing into larger areas.'

          description: Algae and lichen growth on bamboo presents as a mottled surface with shades of green, grey, and brown.
            Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. Coverage varies greatly
            depending on environmental conditions and bamboo surface orientation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Algae: Prefers shaded, damp areas. Lichen: Can colonize both shaded and sun-exposed areas,
            often starting in small cracks and crevices.'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often concentrates along edges and in crevices. Lichen: Can be found both at edges
            and in the center of bamboo sections, depending on species and surface conditions.'
          geometry_effects: 'Algae: Accumulates in concave surfaces and along edges. Lichen: Colonizes rough surfaces and
            avoids smooth, frequently disturbed areas.'
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Lichen: Minimal direct influence,
            but water runoff can affect colonization patterns.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Can appear glossy when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with minimal
            sheen.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rough with accumulated debris. Lichen: Varies
            from smooth and crusty (crustose) to rough and leafy (foliose), sometimes with a powdery or granular surface.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 100 micrometers - 5 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, drip marks, and pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and leafy
            structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: 'Algae: Can be relatively uniform in damp, shaded areas, but highly variable in areas with
            fluctuating moisture. Lichen: Highly variable, depending on species and microclimate.'
        basalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film, darkening and becoming more brownish-green with age.
            Lichen starts as small, indistinct spots, gradually expanding and developing more defined structures over months
            to years. Bleaching and cracking can occur in aged lichen.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Colonization within days of moisture exposure, forming a visible film within a week.
            Lichen: Initial colonization as microscopic spores, with visible growth appearing after several months. Significant
            buildup takes years to decades.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#808080 gray (crustose lichen)'
          - '#A0522D sienna brown (aged lichen)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (bleached lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, concentric rings around initial
            growth points, and a general tendency to colonize shaded and moist areas.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in crevices, shaded areas, and near water sources. Lighter concentration
            on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Edges of basalt structures often show increased growth due to moisture accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the basalt
            surface.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on basalt presents as a mottled surface, ranging from vibrant greens to muted
            grays and browns. Algae typically forms a thin, often slimy film, while lichen creates crustose or foliose structures.
            Coverage varies greatly depending on moisture and sunlight exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Random, clustered, linear (following cracks), gradient (decreasing with increasing sunlight),
            and mosaic (mixture of algae and lichen).
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations of both algae and lichen due to increased
            moisture retention and reduced sunlight exposure. Centers of large, flat surfaces may have less growth.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and depressions accumulate moisture, promoting growth. Edges and corners provide
            sheltered microclimates, also favoring colonization. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to water runoff.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae and nutrients downwards, creating vertical streaks. Pooling occurs
            in depressions, leading to localized concentrations of growth.
          lighting_effects: Algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen is generally matte, although
            some species may have a subtle gloss. Color saturation is enhanced when wet.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Smooth, slimy when wet, slightly rough when dry. Lichen: Crustose forms are tightly adhered
            and rough; foliose forms have a more leafy, textured surface with distinct lobes. Some lichen can be powdery (leprose).'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Crustose Lichen: 50-500 micrometers. Foliose Lichen: 100 micrometers
            - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, gelatinous layers, and sometimes filamentous strands. Lichen: Crusts, patches,
            scales, and leafy lobes.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can be relatively uniform in consistently moist areas, while lichen
            distribution is typically patchy and uneven.
        beech:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, becoming darker and sometimes brownish-green with
            age. Lichen starts as small, light grey or green spots, gradually expanding and thickening over months and years,
            potentially developing more complex structures.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of favorable conditions (high humidity, shade). Significant buildup
            occurs within weeks. Lichen: Colonization is slower, with visible growth appearing after several months. Substantial
            coverage can take years or even decades.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (crustose lichen)'
          - '#8FBC8F dark sea green (foliose lichen)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (aged lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and patches, streaks following water runoff, uniform coating in consistently damp
            areas, concentric rings expanding outwards from initial colonization points.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, crevices, and near the base of the tree. Lighter
            concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Edges of branches and areas with rougher bark texture tend to accumulate
            more growth.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the beech.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in very humid and shaded environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on beech presents as a mottled green and grey-green surface discoloration,
            often concentrated in shaded and damp areas. Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as
            more textured, crustose or foliose patches. The overall effect is a gradual shift from the natural beech color
            to a greenish-grey hue.
          distribution_patterns: Concentrated on the north-facing side of the beech, areas with high humidity, and locations
            sheltered from direct sunlight. Also found in bark crevices and areas where water tends to accumulate.
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Tends to colonize the entire surface if conditions are favorable. Lichen: Often starts
            at edges and crevices, gradually expanding towards the center of the surface.'
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities, such as bark ridges and knots, provide sheltered microclimates that promote
            algae and lichen growth. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more moisture and therefore support higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water can create streaks and drip marks. Lichen: Less affected by gravity
            once established, but initial spore dispersal and water runoff can influence colonization patterns.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Matte when dry, slightly glossy when wet. Lichen: Generally matte, with minimal sheen.
            The texture of lichen can create subtle shadows, enhancing its visual depth under directional lighting.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Smooth, slimy, sometimes slightly sticky. Lichen: Varies from crustose (crusty, tightly
            adhered) to foliose (leafy, loosely attached). Crustose lichen is generally rough and granular, while foliose
            lichen can be smoother with slightly raised edges.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 micrometers (fresh film), up to 50 micrometers (thick, established layer). Lichen:
            Crustose: 50-500 micrometers. Foliose: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, sometimes forming drip marks or pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches,
            small leafy structures (foliose), or powdery coatings (leprose).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in consistently damp areas, while
            lichen distribution is typically patchy and uneven.
        beryllium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days/weeks) exhibits brighter, more vibrant colors. Aged growth (months/years) becomes
            darker, more subdued, and often develops a thicker, more textured crust.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (weeks/months) starts with algae, followed by lichen. Over time (months/years),
            the lichen becomes more dominant, forming a thicker, more extensive crust. Dead organic matter accumulates, darkening
            the overall appearance.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 chartreuse (fresh algae)'
          - '#FFFF00 yellow (early lichen colonization)'
          - '#808000 olive (maturing algae/lichen)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (aged lichen, fungal component dominant)'
          - '#000000 black (dead/decomposed organic matter)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), and a general tendency
            to colonize areas with higher moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in crevices, corners, and areas sheltered from
            direct sunlight and wind. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed flat surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and exposure time. Light
            (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common in moderately humid environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on beryllium presents as a mottled, multi-colored surface discoloration, ranging
            from vibrant greens and yellows to darker browns and blacks. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to extensive,
            almost complete surface encrustation, depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy, often concentrated in areas with higher moisture or nutrient availability.
            Can follow surface imperfections or scratches.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially, then spreads towards the center as coverage increases.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture and organic matter, leading to preferential
            colonization. Concave surfaces also promote growth due to increased moisture retention.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to water runoff carrying spores and nutrients
            downwards. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae can exhibit a slight sheen when wet. Lichen generally has a matte appearance. Under
            oblique lighting, the texture of the lichen becomes more pronounced, casting small shadows.
          texture_details: Initially, algae presents a smooth, sometimes slightly slimy texture. Lichen develops a rough,
            crusty, and often granular texture. Aged growth can become brittle and powdery.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 micrometers (thin film). Lichen: 50-500 micrometers (crustose forms), up to several
            millimeters for more complex foliose or fruticose forms (rare on beryllium).'
          typical_formations: Thin films (algae), crusts (lichen), small patches, and occasional drip marks where water runoff
            occurs.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated spots to near-complete coverage. Uniformity is rare
            due to variations in surface conditions and microclimates.
        birch:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens and becomes mixed with dirt
            and debris. Lichen growth is slow; young lichen are small and pale, gradually expanding and becoming more prominent
            over months and years. Older lichen may exhibit cracking or discoloration.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible film within days of suitable conditions. Significant buildup within weeks.
            Lichen: Colonization is slow; visible spots after months, significant growth after years. Initial colonization
            by pioneer species (e.g., crustose lichen) can prepare the surface for other species.'

          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (crustose lichen)'
          - '#808000 olive (foliose lichen)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (stained bark)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, vertical streaks (due to water runoff), and a general darkening
            of the bark surface. Lichen often forms distinct circular or irregular shapes.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded, moist areas, especially near the base of the tree, in bark
            crevices, and on the north-facing side. Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) in most cases. Extreme (>85%) coverage is possible in very humid
            environments with mature trees.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on birch bark presents as a mottled pattern of green, grey, and brown, often
            concentrated in areas with higher moisture retention. Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears
            as more textured, crustose or foliose patches. The overall effect is a gradual discoloration and roughening of
            the bark surface.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, vertical streaks (due to water runoff), and a general
            darkening of the bark surface. Lichen often forms distinct circular or irregular shapes.
          edge_center_behavior: Algae tends to colonize edges and crevices first, then spreads outwards. Lichen often starts
            as small spots and expands outwards from the center.
          geometry_effects: Crevices and rough surfaces provide more surface area and moisture retention, promoting growth.
            Smooth, sloping surfaces are less conducive to initial colonization.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae spores and nutrients downwards, leading to vertical streaking. Pooling
            of water in depressions encourages localized growth.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, otherwise matte. Lichen: Generally matte, with some
            species exhibiting a slight gloss when dry. The underlying bark may appear darker and less reflective due to the
            presence of the growth.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rougher with accumulated debris. Lichen:
            Varies from crustose (tightly adhering, granular) to foliose (leaf-like, slightly raised) with a rough, sometimes
            brittle texture. Bark underneath can become softened and flaky.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 micrometers (fresh film), up to 50 micrometers (with debris). Lichen: Crustose lichen:
            50-500 micrometers. Foliose lichen: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, sometimes forming drip marks or small pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts,
            patches, and small, leaf-like structures (foliose lichen).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae growth is more uniform in consistently damp areas. Lichen growth is
            patchy and depends on substrate suitability.
        bluestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of moisture exposure. Over months, it darkens
            and becomes less distinct. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months to years to establish visible patches.
            Aged lichen may exhibit bleaching or cracking.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of moisture exposure, reaching peak coverage within weeks. Lichen:
            Colonization begins with microscopic spores, with visible patches appearing after months to years. Buildup continues
            slowly over decades.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#3CB371 medium sea green (mature algae)'
          - '#808080 grey (early lichen colonization)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark grey (established lichen)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mixed algae and lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, and a general darkening of
            the bluestone surface in affected areas.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, near joints and cracks, and on north-facing surfaces.
            Lighter concentration on sun-exposed and well-drained areas.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%), rarely exceeding 60% unless the bluestone is consistently shaded
            and damp.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on bluestone manifests as a mottled green and grey-green discoloration, often
            concentrated in shaded and moisture-rich areas. Algae presents as a slimy film, while lichen forms crusty or leafy
            patches, both contributing to a visually aged and weathered appearance. Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate,
            depending on environmental conditions and surface orientation.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, localized, often following the contours of the bluestone surface. Concentrated in
            areas with prolonged moisture retention.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners where moisture accumulates, but can also colonize the center of
            surfaces if conditions are favorable.
          geometry_effects: Algae and lichen tend to accumulate in depressions and along edges where moisture collects. Rough
            surfaces provide more attachment points for colonization.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth can exhibit downward streaking due to water runoff. Lichen growth is less directly
            influenced by gravity but may be more prevalent on horizontal surfaces where moisture accumulates.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with
            minimal light reflection. Crustose lichen can appear slightly glossy when wet.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rougher with accumulated debris. Lichen:
            Varies from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leafy, with distinct lobes), exhibiting a rough, uneven
            texture. Some lichen species may have a slightly powdery surface.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (film). Lichen: 100 micrometers to 5 millimeters (crustose to foliose).'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, sometimes forming small pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and
            occasionally small, leafy structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form a relatively uniform film in consistently wet areas, while
            lichen exhibits a more patchy and irregular distribution.
        borosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours to days of exposure to moisture and light.
            Over months to years, the algae can darken to brown or black, and lichen colonies establish, adding grey and brown
            hues. Bleaching can occur in areas exposed to intense sunlight, resulting in ivory or pale green patches.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Initial colonization by algae within hours/days, 2) Formation
            of a thin green film within days/weeks, 3) Darkening of the film and establishment of lichen colonies within months,
            4) Thickening and expansion of lichen patches over years, potentially leading to significant surface coverage.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#FFFFF0 ivory (bleached/dead areas)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks running vertically due to gravity-driven water
            flow, and a general tendency to colonize areas with higher moisture retention. Lichen often forms circular or
            irregular patches, expanding outwards from an initial point of colonization.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentrations are typically found at the edges of the glass, in crevices, and in
            areas sheltered from direct sunlight and wind. Lighter concentrations occur on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in newly exposed areas to extreme (>85%) in long-term, neglected
            environments. Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is common in moderately exposed conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on borosilicate glass manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from a
            thin, translucent green film to thicker, opaque patches of green, brown, and grey. The growth often concentrates
            along edges and in areas where moisture accumulates, creating visually distinct patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Distribution patterns include: 1) Film-like coverage of algae, 2) Patchy lichen colonies,
            3) Streaks from water runoff, 4) Concentrated growth at edges and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Growth generally prefers edges and corners due to increased moisture retention and reduced
            exposure to direct sunlight. The center of the glass tends to have less growth, especially in areas with good
            air circulation.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Edges and corners provide sheltered microclimates
            that promote growth. Scratches and imperfections in the glass surface can act as nucleation sites for colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of algae and lichen. Water runoff carries
            nutrients and spores downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns. Pooling of water at the base of the
            glass can lead to concentrated growth in these areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae often exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte appearance when dry.
            Lichen tends to have a matte finish regardless of moisture content. Under oblique lighting, the textured surface
            of lichen becomes more pronounced, revealing its three-dimensional structure.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (mature lichen). Algae
            often presents a gelatinous or powdery surface when dry, while lichen exhibits a more rigid, sometimes crystalline
            texture due to the presence of fungal hyphae and mineral deposits.
          thickness_range: Algae films typically range from 1-10 micrometers. Lichen thalli can vary from 50 micrometers to
            several millimeters in thickness, depending on the species and age.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films of algae, 2) Crust-like lichen patches, 3) Drip marks
            from water runoff carrying nutrients, 4) Small pools of algae in depressions.'
          uniformity_assessment: The growth is highly variable, rarely perfectly uniform. Algae can form a relatively uniform
            film under ideal conditions, but lichen growth is inherently patchy and uneven.
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens to brown and becomes more textured.
            Lichen starts as small, light-colored spots and gradually expands, thickening and developing a more complex morphology
            over months to years.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Microscopic algal cells or lichen spores attach to the
            surface. Early growth (weeks-months): Visible patches of algae or lichen appear. Maturation (months-years): Colonies
            expand, thicken, and develop more complex structures. Algae may undergo cycles of growth and die-off depending
            on moisture availability. Lichen growth is generally slower and more persistent.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (bleached lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, concentric rings expanding
            from initial growth points.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in crevices, corners, and areas with prolonged moisture. Lighter concentration
            on exposed, well-ventilated surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the duration of exposure.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on brass presents as a mottled surface with shades of green, brown, and grey,
            often concentrated in areas retaining moisture. The growth typically starts as small, discrete patches and expands
            over time to form larger, interconnected colonies. Lichen often appears crusty, while algae tends to be slimy.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized in areas with higher moisture retention, such as sheltered surfaces,
            crevices, and areas shaded from direct sunlight. Often found near joints or areas where water tends to pool.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often show preferential growth due to moisture accumulation and reduced
            direct sunlight exposure. Centers of large, flat surfaces may exhibit less growth initially.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to preferential growth in these
            areas. Concave surfaces provide sheltered environments conducive to growth.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to water runoff carrying algae and nutrients
            downwards. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker, more concentrated growth.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dry algae and lichen: Matte appearance. Some lichen
            species may exhibit subtle iridescence due to surface structures.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially slimy and smooth, becoming rougher with accumulated debris. Lichen: Crusty, granular,
            and sometimes foliose (leaf-like) with a rough texture. Microscopic examination reveals a complex interwoven structure
            of fungal hyphae and algal cells within the lichen.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-100 micrometers. Lichen: 100 micrometers to 2 millimeters, depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, slimy patches, drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, small foliose structures,
            sometimes forming raised, three-dimensional colonies.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from sparse, isolated patches to a dense, almost uniform coating,
            depending on environmental conditions and the age of the growth.
        breccia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae is vibrant green and slimy. Over time, it darkens to olive or brown and becomes drier.
            Lichen starts as small, light gray spots and gradually expands, thickening and potentially changing color.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: visible within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Lichen: initial colonization
            may take months or years, with significant growth occurring over decades. Algae precedes lichen in many cases,
            preparing the surface.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (crustose lichen)'
          - '#808000 olive (aged algae/lichen mix)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (bleached/dead lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, concentric rings around initial
            growth points, diffuse coating.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with consistent moisture. Lighter
            concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Edges and corners may accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the breccia
            surface.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on breccia presents as a mottled surface with shades of green, grey, and brown.
            Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches, often concentrated
            in shaded or moisture-rich areas.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, concentric rings around
            initial growth points, diffuse coating.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often show higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation. Centers of
            large, flat surfaces may have less growth due to increased sunlight exposure.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and crevices trap moisture and nutrients, promoting growth. Convex surfaces are
            more exposed to sunlight and drying, inhibiting growth.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth often exhibits downward streaking due to water runoff. Lichen growth is less affected
            by gravity but may be more prevalent on vertical surfaces that receive less direct sunlight.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: wet algae exhibits a slight sheen; dry algae is matte. Lichen: generally matte, but some
            species may have a slight gloss when wet. Breccia underneath is matte.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: smooth, slimy, sometimes powdery when dry. Lichen: rough, crusty, foliose (leafy), or fruticose
            (shrub-like). Breccia surface underneath remains rough and granular.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 0.1-5 millimeters, depending
            on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: thin films, slimy coatings, powdery residues. Lichen: crusts, patches, leafy structures,
            small shrub-like growths.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in consistently moist areas, while
            lichen growth is typically patchy and uneven.
        brick:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears vibrant green and slimy, transitioning to a duller, brownish-green or greyish-brown
            as it dries and ages. Lichen growth is slow; fresh lichen is often brighter in color, becoming more subdued and
            sometimes darker with age, often accompanied by increased surface roughness.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of moisture exposure, forming a visible film within
            weeks. Significant buildup (visible discoloration) within months. Lichen: Initial colonization can take months
            or years. Visible growth within 1-2 years. Significant buildup (patchy coverage) over 5-10 years or more.'
          color_variations:
          - '#3D85C6 blue-green (cyanobacteria)'
          - '#7CB342 olive-green (fresh algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 light grey (lichen)'
          - '#606C5D dark grey-green (aged algae/lichen mix)'
          - '#F0E68C khaki (dried algae residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially below windows or ledges), uniform coating (in consistently
            damp areas), drip marks from water runoff, and irregular patches of varying sizes.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, near water sources (downspouts, leaky gutters), and
            in crevices. Lighter concentration on exposed, sun-facing surfaces. Edges and corners often accumulate more moisture,
            leading to higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and time since last cleaning.
            Light (10-30%) is common in drier climates or on well-maintained surfaces. Moderate (30-60%) is typical in moderately
            humid environments. Heavy (60-85%) is observed in consistently damp, shaded areas.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on brick presents as a mottled, often greenish or greyish discoloration, ranging
            from sparse spots to extensive coverage. Algae tends to form a slimy film, while lichen creates crusty or leafy
            patches, both contributing to a weathered appearance. The color and texture vary significantly based on species,
            brick composition, and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Random, clustered, linear (following mortar joints), gradient (decreasing concentration with
            height), and shadow-dependent (more prevalent in shaded areas).
          edge_center_behavior: Algae tends to colonize uniformly across the brick surface if moisture is consistent. Lichen
            often prefers edges and corners initially, expanding outwards. Mortar joints are often colonized first due to
            their porous nature.
          geometry_effects: Recessed areas (mortar joints, imperfections) trap moisture and provide sheltered environments,
            promoting growth. Protruding features (edges, corners) can also accumulate moisture due to condensation and runoff.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in vertical streaking of algae and lichen growth,
            especially below windowsills and ledges. Pooling occurs in horizontal crevices and depressions.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte,
            but some species may have a slight sheen when wet. The color saturation is higher under direct sunlight.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and sometimes powdery when dry. Lichen: Varies
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leafy, lobed) and fruticose (shrubby), with textures ranging
            from smooth to granular and sometimes crystalline.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh film), up to 200 micrometers (dried crust). Lichen: 0.1-5 millimeters,
            depending on species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), pools (in depressions), films (thin, uniform layers), crusts
            (thick, hardened layers), patches (irregularly shaped areas of growth).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in consistently damp areas, while
            lichen growth is typically patchy and uneven.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Over months/years,
            it darkens to olive or brown. Lichen develops slowly, taking months to years to form visible thalli. Aged lichen
            can become brittle and cracked.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (days-weeks) by algae, forming a thin green film. Lichen colonization
            follows (months-years), slowly forming crusty or foliose structures. Buildup accelerates in consistently moist
            and shaded environments. The process can take years to reach heavy coverage.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'

          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (bronze substrate showing through)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, and a general tendency to colonize
            shaded and damp areas. Lichen often forms circular or irregular thalli (body) with distinct edges.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with prolonged moisture. Lighter
            concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Corners and edges often accumulate more moisture and thus exhibit heavier
            growth.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions, bronze composition, and
            surface orientation. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are most common in moderately humid environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on bronze manifests as a mottled, multi-hued patina, ranging from vibrant greens
            to dull browns and grays. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to extensive encrustation, often concentrated
            in areas with moisture retention. The growth introduces a textured surface, contrasting with the original smooth
            bronze.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy, often following the contours of the bronze surface and areas of water
            accumulation. Favors micro-crevices and imperfections in the metal.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation and reduced
            sunlight exposure. Centers of flat surfaces may have less growth due to better drainage and increased sunlight.

            localized patches in drier areas.
        calcite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, transitioning to brownish-green or khaki as it dries
            and ages. Lichen growth is slow; fresh lichen is typically lighter in color and becomes darker and more textured
            over months/years.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within hours/days, visible film formation within a week, significant
            buildup within months. Lichen: Initial colonization can take months/years, visible patches within years, significant
            buildup over decades.'

            rough surfaces more readily than smooth ones, utilizing crevices for anchorage and moisture retention.'
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Lichen: Less directly affected
            by gravity, but water runoff can influence nutrient distribution and growth patterns.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen; dried algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but
            some species may have a slight gloss when wet. Calcite underneath may have a chalky appearance.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and slightly crusty when dried. Lichen: Ranges
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leafy, lobed) with a rough, sometimes powdery surface. Calcite

          description: Algae and lichen growth on CMCs manifests as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration, often concentrated
            in areas with moisture retention. Algae presents as a slimy film, while lichen forms crusty patches, both contributing
            to a heterogeneous surface appearance. The dominant colors are shades of green and brown, with coverage ranging
            from sparse to moderate depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: On CMCs, algae and lichen tend to colonize porous regions, surface defects, and areas where
            moisture accumulates. They often follow the contours of the CMC's surface texture, exploiting micro-crevices and
            irregularities.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often preferred locations for initial colonization due to increased
            moisture retention and surface area. Over time, growth can spread towards the center of the CMC panel.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and areas with restricted airflow promote moisture retention, leading to increased
            algae and lichen growth. Sharp edges and corners may experience accelerated colonization due to increased surface
            area and moisture accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes water runoff, leading to vertical streaking of algae and lichen growth. Pooling
            of water in depressions promotes localized colonization. Drip marks are a common manifestation of gravity's influence.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish when dry.

            drier and more brittle.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days): Microscopic algae spores attach and begin to grow. Visible spots
            appear within a week. Expansion (weeks-months): Algae colonies expand and coalesce, forming larger patches. Lichen
            colonization begins. Maturation (months-years): Lichen becomes dominant, forming crusty or foliose structures.

            in depressions leads to localized areas of higher concentration.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish as it dries. Lichen
            tends to have a matte appearance regardless of moisture levels. No significant iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the algae presents a smooth, slightly slimy texture. As it dries and lichen colonizes,

          distribution_patterns: 'Algae: Uniform film, streaks from water runoff, localized concentrations in areas of moisture
            retention. Lichen: Isolated patches, often starting at imperfections in the glass surface.'
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often preferred locations for initial growth due to moisture retention.
            Center areas may be colonized later if conditions are favorable.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations of both algae
            and lichen. Surface imperfections provide nucleation sites for lichen growth.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks. Pooling occurs in horizontal surfaces or depressions.
            Lichen: Less affected by gravity once established, but initial spore deposition may be influenced by wind and
            rain.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Appears glossy when wet, matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with minimal sheen.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rough with sediment accumulation. Lichen:
            Crusty, granular, and sometimes foliose (leaf-like) with a rough texture.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, streaks, pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches, small foliose structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: 'Algae: Can range from perfectly uniform (thin film) to highly variable (streaks and patches).
            Lichen: Highly variable, forming distinct patches.'
        dysprosium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days/weeks) is typically vibrant green and slimy. Aged growth (months/years) becomes
            darker, browner, and more crusty. Lichen growth is slow, with noticeable changes occurring over years rather than
            months.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (weeks/months) starts with sparse, localized spots of algae. These spots
            expand and coalesce, forming larger patches. Lichen colonization is slower, with visible growth occurring over
            years. Algae growth can accelerate lichen establishment by providing a more hospitable microenvironment. Over
            years, the lichen will dominate.

          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen thallus)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (lichen apothecia)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, expanding patches, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), and a general tendency
            to colonize areas with higher moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in crevices, corners, and areas protected from
            direct sunlight and wind. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) in initial stages. Can reach heavy (60-85%) or even extreme
            (>85%) coverage in favorable conditions over extended periods.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on dysprosium surfaces presents as a mottled, greenish-brown coating. Initial
            colonization appears as localized spots that gradually coalesce into larger patches. The color varies depending
            on the species and environmental conditions, ranging from vibrant green to dark brown.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential growth in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with higher moisture
            content. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to water runoff.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to increased moisture retention and protection from
            direct sunlight. Over time, growth can spread towards the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and orientation significantly influence growth. Rough surfaces and vertical
            orientations promote water retention and streaking, respectively.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to streaking patterns on vertical surfaces. Pooling
            of water in depressions promotes localized growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Dried algae and lichen have a matte appearance.
            No significant iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: Algae exhibits a slimy, smooth texture when fresh, transitioning to a rough, slightly crusty texture
            as it dries. Lichen presents a crustose texture, tightly adhering to the dysprosium surface, with occasional raised
            apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are granular and slightly rough.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 5-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 100-500 micrometers (thallus),
            up to 1 millimeter (apothecia).'
          typical_formations: Algae forms films and patches. Lichen forms crusts and patches, with occasional raised apothecia.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The growth is rarely uniform, with significant variations in thickness and
            coverage across the surface.
        epoxy resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film within hours/days. Over months/years, it darkens to
            olive or brown. Lichen develops slowly, starting as small gray spots and expanding over years into larger, more
            textured patches.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight, forming a thin
            film. Buildup progresses rapidly in humid conditions, reaching moderate coverage within weeks. Lichen: Initial
            colonization takes months to years, starting as small spots. Buildup is slow, with significant coverage taking
            years to develop.'

          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (aged lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water runoff, uniform coating in high-humidity environments,
            drip marks from condensation.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, corners, and crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces due to desiccation.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed environments. Light (10-30%) in moderately humid areas. Moderate
            (30-60%) in shaded, consistently moist locations. Heavy (60-85%) in areas with standing water or high humidity.
            Extreme (>85%) is rare but possible in perpetually wet, shaded conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on epoxy resin composites manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from
            vibrant green to dull gray-green, often appearing in localized patches or streaks. The growth is typically more
            pronounced in shaded, moisture-rich areas, creating a mottled appearance on the composite surface.
          distribution_patterns: Concentrated in areas with prolonged moisture exposure, such as near joints, edges, and areas
            shielded from direct sunlight. Often found in micro-cracks and surface imperfections of the epoxy resin.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation and potential surface imperfections.
            Can spread to the center of the surface with prolonged exposure and favorable conditions.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and edges tend to accumulate more moisture, promoting higher concentrations of
            algae and lichen. Sharp corners can act as nucleation points for initial growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae growth. Pooling
            of water in depressions creates localized areas of high concentration.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen is generally matte,
            with minimal light reflection.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and slightly powdery when dry. Lichen: Crusty,
            granular, and sometimes foliose (leaf-like) with a rough texture.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50-500 micrometers.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, drip marks, and pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and occasionally
            foliose structures adhering tightly to the surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated patches to a nearly uniform coating depending
            on environmental conditions and surface preparation.
        europium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days) appears as a thin, easily removable film. Aged growth (months/years) becomes
            a firmly adhered, thicker crust with distinct lichen structures. Color darkens and texture becomes more pronounced
            with age.
          buildup_progression: 'Days: Initial algal film formation. Weeks: Algal film thickens, color changes. Months: Lichen
            colonization begins. Years: Mature lichen thalli develop, forming a crusty, textured surface.'

            thalli.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are observed in crevices, corners, and areas sheltered from direct
            sunlight and wind. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) in early stages. Can reach heavy (60-85%) or even extreme (>85%)
            in humid environments over extended periods.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on Europium surfaces manifest as a heterogeneous coating, initially appearing
            as a thin, greenish-yellow film that gradually thickens and darkens to a brownish-green crust. The growth is typically
            localized, favoring areas with moisture retention and surface irregularities. Lichen, in particular, forms distinct,
            often circular, thalli.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy, often concentrated in areas with higher moisture levels or surface imperfections.
            Lichen tends to form discrete colonies.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation. Center areas may become
            colonized later as the growth spreads.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture and organic matter, promoting growth. Surface
            roughness provides more attachment points for algae and lichen.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to water runoff carrying algae and nutrients
            downwards. Pooling may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish as it dries. Lichen
            has a generally matte appearance. Under oblique lighting, the textured surface of aged growth becomes more apparent.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slimy (algae), transitioning to rough and crusty (algae/lichen mix), and finally
            becoming a textured, slightly raised surface with visible lichen thalli. Lichen thalli exhibit a granular or foliose
            (leaf-like) texture.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 μm (initial film), up to 50 μm (thickened layer). Lichen: 100 μm - 1 mm (thallus thickness).'
          typical_formations: Thin films (algae), crusts (mixed algae/lichen), patches (localized growth), distinct thalli
            (lichen), drip marks (where water flows).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae may form a relatively uniform film initially, but quickly becomes
            patchy. Lichen growth is inherently non-uniform.
        fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film within days of moisture exposure. Over months, it darkens
            and may become mixed with lichen. Lichen develops slowly, taking months to years to form visible patches. Aged
            growth becomes darker, drier, and more brittle.
          buildup_progression: Initial algae growth (days-weeks) appears as a thin, green film. Lichen colonization (months-years)
            follows, starting as small spots and gradually expanding. Over time (years), the growth becomes thicker, darker,
            and more complex, potentially leading to FRPU surface degradation.

          - '#827717 yellowish-brown (aged lichen)'
          - '#4E342E dark-brown (decomposing algae/lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, sometimes a uniform coating
            of algae in consistently damp areas.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with moisture retention (e.g., crevices, seams, areas shaded
            from direct sunlight). Lighter concentration on exposed, well-drained surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on environmental conditions and FRPU surface treatment.
            Extreme (>85%) is rare but possible in consistently damp, shaded environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on FRPU presents as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration with varying degrees
            of coverage. Algae typically forms a slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. The growth is
            often concentrated in areas with moisture retention and limited direct sunlight.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, influenced by moisture, sunlight, and FRPU surface texture. Often found in shaded
            areas, crevices, and areas with poor drainage.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation and reduced
            sunlight exposure. Center areas may be less affected if they are exposed to direct sunlight and good drainage.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, leading to higher concentrations
            of growth. Concave surfaces provide sheltered environments conducive to growth.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks. Pooling of water in depressions promotes localized
            growth. Lichen: Less affected by gravity once established, but initial spore settlement may be influenced by water
            runoff.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae has a slight sheen. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but some species
            may exhibit a slight gloss when wet. No iridescence observed.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Smooth, slimy, sometimes slightly sticky. Lichen: Rough, crusty, sometimes leafy (foliose)
            or shrub-like (fruticose). FRPU surface underneath may become pitted or etched over long periods.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (film), up to 200 micrometers (thick mats). Lichen: 100 micrometers -
            5 millimeters (depending on species).'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, mats, streaks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, leafy structures (foliose), shrub-like
            structures (fruticose).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from sparse, isolated patches to a nearly complete coating, depending
            on environmental conditions and FRPU surface properties.
        fiberglass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of moisture exposure. Aged algae darkens
            to brown or black, often mixed with dirt and debris. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months to years to
            form visible patches, which may bleach or darken over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of moisture exposure, forming a thin film. Buildup
            progresses rapidly in humid conditions, thickening and darkening over weeks to months. Lichen: Initial colonization
            takes months to years, forming small patches. Buildup is slow, with patches expanding and thickening over years.'

          description: Algae and lichen growth on fiberglass presents as a mottled, often greenish or brownish discoloration.
            Algae tends to form a slimy film, while lichen creates more textured, crusty patches. Coverage ranges from sparse
            spotting to extensive surface coating, depending on environmental conditions and time.
          distribution_patterns: Random, localized, or uniform depending on moisture availability, sunlight exposure, and
            surface texture. Streaks are common on vertical surfaces due to water runoff.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation and reduced
            airflow. Flat, central areas may have lower concentrations, especially if exposed to direct sunlight.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, promoting algae and lichen growth.
            Concave surfaces retain water longer, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes water runoff, leading to vertical streaking of algae. Pooling occurs in horizontal
            depressions. Lichen growth is less directly affected by gravity but may be influenced by water flow patterns.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but some
            species may have a subtle gloss when wet.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rougher with accumulated debris. Lichen: Crusty, granular,
            or foliose (leaf-like) depending on species. Can feel slightly raised above the fiberglass surface.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-100 micrometers. Lichen: 100 micrometers to 5 millimeters, depending on species and age.'

            lichen growth is typically patchy and uneven.
        fir:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Over months/years,
            it darkens to olive or brown. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months to years to establish visible patches,
            gradually expanding and potentially bleaching with prolonged sun exposure.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible film within days of moisture exposure, thickening over weeks. Lichen: Initial
            colonization (invisible) takes months, followed by slow growth of visible patches over years. Algae often precedes
            lichen colonization, creating a suitable substrate.'

            Concentrated along the grain of the wood and in crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation, then spreads towards the
            center of surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations of algae
            and lichen. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to gravity-driven water flow.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth often shows downward streaking on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. Lichen,
            being more firmly attached, is less affected by gravity once established.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: wet algae exhibits a slight sheen; dry algae is matte. Lichen: generally matte, but some
            foliose types may have a subtle gloss.'

          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse isolated spots to dense, confluent patches. Not uniform.
        float glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens to brown or tan, becoming more
            crusty and less vibrant. Lichen slowly expands its thallus, becoming thicker and potentially exhibiting fruiting
            bodies (apothecia) which are small, disc-like structures.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Sparse, microscopic algae film. Light coverage (weeks-months):
            Visible green film, localized spots. Moderate coverage (months-years): Increased density, streaking, lichen colonization.

          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (dried algae residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially from water runoff), irregular patches, and a general film-like
            coating. Lichen often forms distinct circular or irregular thalli (body) structures.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations tend to occur in areas with higher moisture retention, such as
            near edges, corners, and crevices. Areas exposed to direct sunlight and frequent drying may exhibit lighter concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and time. Initial colonization
            is typically sparse, progressing to light or moderate coverage over months or years.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on float glass manifests as a spectrum of green and brown hues, often appearing
            as localized spots or streaks. Initial growth is typically sparse, expanding over time to form a more substantial,
            textured layer. Lichen tends to be more crust-like, while algae presents as a smoother film.
          distribution_patterns: Random distribution initially, influenced by moisture and nutrient availability. Streaks
            form along water runoff paths. Lichen tends to colonize in areas with stable moisture and minimal disturbance.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to increased moisture retention
            and reduced direct sunlight exposure. The center of large glass panes may have lower concentrations due to faster
            drying.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Depressions and rough surfaces provide
            more favorable conditions for colonization. Vertical surfaces promote streaking due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae. Pooling occurs
            in horizontal depressions. Lichen, being more firmly attached, is less affected by gravity once established.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen is generally matte,
            with minimal light reflection. Under oblique lighting, the textured surface of lichen becomes more apparent.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, transitioning to a slightly rough, matte film upon drying.
            Lichen: Crusty, granular, and often exhibiting a slightly raised, three-dimensional texture. Both can become powdery
            with age and weathering.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried/layered). Lichen: 50 micrometers

            and occasionally small, raised fruiting bodies.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in areas with consistent moisture,
            but is generally patchy. Lichen is almost always non-uniform, forming distinct colonies.
        fused silica:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Over months/years, the color darkens
            to brownish-green or black, the texture becomes rougher and more crusty, and lichen colonies become more defined.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days/weeks): Thin, green algal film. Intermediate stage (months): Darkening
            of algae, appearance of lichen. Advanced stage (years): Thick, crusty lichen growth, potential for surface etching.'

          description: Algae and lichen growth on fused silica presents as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from vibrant green
            to brownish-black, often concentrated in areas with moisture retention. The growth typically starts as small,
            localized spots and expands into larger, irregular patches or streaks, influenced by gravity and surface irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: Random nucleation sites that expand into irregular patches. Streaking on vertical surfaces
            due to water runoff. Concentration in areas with higher humidity or nutrient availability.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners initially, due to increased moisture retention. Over time,
            the growth can spread towards the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and irregularities promote growth by providing nucleation sites and trapping
            moisture. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more growth than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to gravitational flow of water and nutrients. Pooling
            of water at the base of vertical surfaces can lead to increased growth in those areas.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae often exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Aged algae and lichen tend to be matte. Under

        gallium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) becomes thicker,
            darker (brownish-green), more textured, and may exhibit signs of drying and cracking. Lichen components become
            more prominent, adding a crusty or foliose appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (days-weeks) starts with a thin, often invisible, biofilm. Algae growth
            (weeks-months) becomes visible as a green film. Lichen colonization (months-years) follows, adding a crusty or
            foliose texture. Buildup accelerates in humid environments.

            accumulates. Lighter concentrations occur on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%) depending on environmental conditions and exposure time. Light
            (10-30%) is common in early stages. Moderate (30-60%) is typical in moderately humid environments. Heavy (60-85%)
            occurs in consistently wet or shaded areas.
          description: 'Algae and lichen growth on gallium surfaces manifests as a heterogeneous mix of green and brown patches,
            often concentrated in areas with moisture accumulation. The growth typically starts as a thin film and progresses
            to thicker, more textured formations over time, exhibiting a preference for edges and crevices. Dominant colors
            are #228B22 (forest green) and #8B4513 (saddle brown).'
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, non-uniform distribution. Concentrated in areas with moisture retention, such as
            surface imperfections, scratches, and edges.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices due to increased moisture retention and protection from direct
            sunlight. Center areas are generally less susceptible unless they contain surface imperfections.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Grooves and depressions act as reservoirs
            for moisture and nutrients, promoting localized growth. Sharp edges provide anchoring points for initial colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water and nutrients, resulting in vertical streaking patterns,
            especially on vertical or inclined surfaces. Pooling occurs in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Dried algae and lichen have a matte appearance.
            Under oblique lighting, the textured surface casts shadows, enhancing the perceived roughness.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slimy (algae), transitioning to rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery (lichen)
            with age. The gallium surface underneath may exhibit localized corrosion, leading to pitting and increased roughness.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: Thin films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches, and drip marks (on vertical surfaces). Lichen
            may form small, raised structures (foliose or fruticose forms).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from sparse, isolated colonies to dense, confluent growth depending
            on environmental conditions and surface preparation.
        gallium arsenide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours/days of initial colonization. Aged algae
            darkens to brown or black, becoming brittle and potentially flaking off after months. Lichen growth is much slower,
            with visible changes occurring over months/years, leading to a thicker, more textured, and often discolored appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization occurs within hours/days, followed by rapid growth and expansion.
            Significant buildup can occur within weeks. Lichen: Colonization is much slower, with visible growth taking months/years.
            Buildup is a gradual process, with thalli slowly increasing in size and thickness.'

          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following surface imperfections, drip marks from water runoff, and irregular
            patches of varying sizes. Lichen tends to form more defined, circular or irregular thalli.
          concentration_variations: 'Algae: Higher concentrations in areas with moisture accumulation, such as crevices, edges,
            and areas sheltered from direct sunlight. Lichen: Thalli tend to be more concentrated in areas with stable microclimates
            and minimal disturbance.'

            a more uniform distribution, although edges can provide initial attachment points.'
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and imperfections provide nucleation sites for both algae and lichen. Grooves
            and pits can trap moisture and nutrients, promoting localized growth. Sharp edges may experience increased runoff,
            leading to streaking patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the distribution of water and nutrients, leading to downward flow patterns
            and pooling in low-lying areas. Vertical surfaces may exhibit streaking patterns due to water runoff carrying
            algae and lichen spores.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish as it dries. Lichen
            generally has a matte appearance, although some species may exhibit a slight gloss depending on their surface
            structure. Under oblique lighting, the texture of both algae and lichen becomes more pronounced.

            thalli formations with varying shapes and sizes.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae growth is rarely perfectly uniform, often concentrated in areas with
            higher moisture or nutrient availability. Lichen growth is even less uniform, with individual thalli scattered
            across the surface.
        glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of exposure. Over months, it darkens to
            olive or brown. Lichen develops slowly, forming visible crusts over years, often with a sienna or gray coloration.
            Dead algae and lichen become brittle and flaky.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Thin film of algae. Intermediate growth (months): Development

            moisture exposure. Lighter concentrations on exposed, sunlit surfaces with good drainage.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the GFRP
            structure. Light (10-30%) is common in moderately exposed areas. Moderate (30-60%) occurs in consistently damp

            ranging from sparse spots to extensive coverage. The growth typically follows moisture patterns and surface irregularities,
            creating visually complex textures. Lichen tends to be more crustose and persistent than algae.
          distribution_patterns: Epilithic (growing on the surface), Endolithic (penetrating into the rock pores - less common
            but possible with certain algae).
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often prefers edges and corners where moisture accumulates. Lichen: Can be uniform
            or prefer edges, depending on the species and microclimate. Center of a large flat surface may have less growth
            due to faster drying.'
          geometry_effects: Algae and lichen preferentially colonize depressions, cracks, and rough surfaces where moisture
            is retained. Smooth, steeply angled surfaces are less susceptible to colonization.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth often exhibits downward flow patterns, creating streaks and drip marks. Lichen growth
            is less directly influenced by gravity, but water runoff can affect its distribution and shape.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but some
            species may have a slight gloss when wet. No iridescence is typically observed.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and powdery when dry. Lichen: Crustose (tightly
            adhering crust), foliose (leaf-like), or fruticose (shrub-like), ranging from smooth to granular to rough and
            scaly. Some lichen species exhibit a crystalline texture under magnification.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 100 micrometers to 5 millimeters,
            depending on species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, drip marks, pools in depressions. Lichen: Crusts, patches, rosettes, scales,
            small shrub-like formations.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from perfectly uniform (e.g., a thin film of algae in a consistently
            wet area) to highly variable (e.g., patchy lichen growth with bare granite in between).
        hafnium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) darkens
            to brown or gray, thickens, and develops a crusty texture. Lichen formation becomes more prominent over longer
            periods.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Thin, green algae film. Intermediate growth (weeks-months):
            Patchy algae and early lichen formation. Mature growth (months-years): Thick, crusty lichen with mineral deposits
            and biofilm accumulation.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#3CB371 medium sea green (established algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen with fungal component)'
          - '#2F4F4F dark slate gray (biofilm/dirt accumulation)'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns include localized spots, expanding patches, streaks (especially on vertical
            surfaces), and drip marks from water runoff. Growth tends to concentrate in areas with higher moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with higher moisture retention (crevices, corners, shaded
            areas). Lighter concentration on exposed, well-ventilated surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed environments; Light (10-30%) in moderately exposed areas; Moderate
            (30-60%) in shaded, moist environments; Heavy (60-85%) in consistently wet areas; Extreme (>85%) in submerged
            or perpetually damp conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on hafnium surfaces manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from vibrant
            green to dark brown. Initial colonization appears as localized spots, evolving into interconnected patches with
            increasing exposure time. The growth exhibits a matte finish and varies in thickness depending on environmental
            conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, expanding patches, streaks, drip marks, uniform thin film (initial algae
            colonization).
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation. Over time, growth can spread
            towards the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and nutrients, leading to higher concentrations
            of growth. Recessed areas provide shelter from direct sunlight and wind, promoting colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling at the base
            of vertical surfaces. Drip marks are a common manifestation of this effect.
          lighting_effects: The surface exhibits a matte finish under most lighting conditions. Wet algae may display a slight
            sheen. Mineral deposits can create a subtle iridescence in specific lighting angles.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (aged lichen). Biofilms
            contribute a sticky or gelatinous feel. Mineral deposits from water evaporation can create a powdery surface.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 micrometers (fresh algae film) to 50-500 micrometers (mature lichen
            crust). Biofilms can add an additional 1-20 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films (initial algae), crusts (mature lichen), patches (mixed algae/lichen), drip marks
            (vertical surfaces), pools (horizontal surfaces with poor drainage).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse and patchy to near-uniform coverage depending on environmental
            conditions and surface orientation.
        hastelloy:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae (hours/days) appears as a vibrant green film. Aged algae (weeks/months) darkens to
            brown and becomes more textured. Lichen (months/years) develops a crusty, layered appearance with distinct thallus
            and apothecia.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days/weeks): Microscopic algae spores or lichen fragments attach to
            the surface. Early growth (weeks/months): Visible algae film or small lichen patches appear. Mature growth (months/years):
            Algae thickens and darkens; lichen develops a more complex structure with apothecia.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 chartreuse (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (lichen thallus)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen apothecia)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, expanding patches, streaks (especially in areas with water runoff), and uniform
            coating (in highly humid environments).
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in areas with higher moisture levels, such
            as crevices, edges, and areas sheltered from direct sunlight. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, well-drained
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the growth.
            Initial colonization is typically sparse, progressing to light or moderate coverage over time. Extreme coverage
            is possible in highly favorable environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on Hastelloy surfaces typically presents as a mottled green and brown coating.
            Initial growth often appears as localized spots, expanding into larger, interconnected patches over time. The
            color and texture vary significantly depending on the specific species and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Initially localized around imperfections or areas with moisture accumulation. Over time,
            it spreads to cover larger areas. Lichen tends to colonize more slowly and may exhibit distinct zonation patterns.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation. Over time, it can spread
            to the center of surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture and organic matter, promoting initial colonization.
            Vertical surfaces may exhibit streaking due to water runoff. Horizontal surfaces can accumulate thicker layers
            of growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae. Pooling can occur
            in depressions and horizontal surfaces, resulting in thicker accumulations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen generally has a
            matte finish. Under oblique lighting, the texture of lichen becomes more pronounced.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (mature lichen). Algae
            can be powdery when dried. Lichen often exhibits a more complex, three-dimensional texture with raised apothecia
            (fruiting bodies).
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50-500 micrometers.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, pools (in depressions), streaks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, rosettes, foliose structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in consistently wet areas, while
            lichen growth is typically patchy and uneven.
        hickory:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of moisture exposure. Aged algae fades
            to a duller, grey-green and may develop a rougher texture. Lichen growth is slower, taking months to years to
            establish, and may exhibit color changes due to sun bleaching.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of moisture exposure, forming a thin film. Buildup
            progresses rapidly in humid conditions, reaching moderate coverage within weeks. Lichen: Colonization is slower,
            taking months to years to establish visible growth. Buildup is gradual, with coverage increasing over several
            years. Sooty mold: Appears quickly (days) following algae growth, feeding on its byproducts.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CB342 fresh green algae'
          - '#A9B777 aged green algae'
          - '#808080 grey-green lichen'
          - '#C0C0C0 bleached lichen (sun-exposed)'
          - '#333333 dark grey/black (sooty mold association)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following grain, drip marks from water runoff, overall
            mottled appearance.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentration in shaded areas, corners, crevices, and areas where water pools.
            Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and duration of exposure.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in consistently damp and shaded environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on hickory presents as a mottled green and grey-green surface discoloration,
            often concentrated in shaded or moisture-prone areas. The growth typically starts as small, discrete patches and
            expands to cover larger areas, exhibiting a range of textures from smooth to crusty.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily on shaded surfaces, areas with poor ventilation, and locations where moisture accumulates.
            Concentrated along grain lines and in crevices.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation. Center
            areas may show less growth due to better ventilation and sunlight exposure.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations of growth.
            Rough surfaces provide more surface area for attachment and colonization.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Pooling of water in depressions promotes
            localized growth.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, otherwise matte. Lichen: Generally matte, with minimal
            light reflection. Sooty mold: Matte, absorbs light.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rough with age. Lichen: Varies from smooth
            and crustose to foliose (leafy) with a slightly rough, granular texture. Sooty mold (often associated): Powdery
            or velvety.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 100 micrometers - 5 millimeters (depending on species). Sooty
            mold: 1-10 micrometers.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, localized pools, streaks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, small leafy structures
            (foliose lichens). Sooty mold: Powdery or velvety coatings.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated patches to near-uniform coverage in heavily
            shaded and damp conditions.
        inconel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time (days to weeks), it dries, darkens to olive
            or brown, and becomes more brittle. Lichen, on the other hand, develops slowly (months to years), starting as
            small spots and gradually expanding into larger, more textured formations.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within hours/days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Significant
            buildup within weeks. Lichen: Initial colonization within months/years. Gradual expansion over years/decades.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 (Lawn Green) - Fresh algae bloom'
          - '#3CB371 (Medium Sea Green) - Maturing algae'
          - '#808000 (Olive) - Drying algae'
          - '#A0522D (Sienna) - Aged algae/lichen'
          - '#D2B48C (Tan) - Lichen thallus'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water flow, irregular patches, and sometimes a uniform thin
            film across the surface. Lichen often forms circular or irregular thalli.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in areas with higher moisture levels, such
            as crevices, edges, and areas sheltered from direct sunlight. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, flat surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and exposure time. Extreme
            coverage (>85%) is rare on Inconel due to its inherent resistance to corrosion.
          description: 'Algae and lichen growth on Inconel surfaces presents as a mottled, multi-hued coating, ranging from
            vibrant greens to dull browns. Coverage varies significantly depending on environmental conditions, often appearing
            as localized patches or streaks. The dominant colors are #3CB371 (Medium Sea Green) and #8B4513 (Saddle Brown).'
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, streaky, localized around moisture sources, and occasionally forming a thin, uniform
            film.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices initially due to moisture accumulation and protection from direct
            sunlight. Over time, it can spread towards the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and orientation significantly influence growth. Rough surfaces provide more
            attachment points. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more moisture and debris, promoting growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in streaking patterns, especially with algae.
            Pooling occurs in depressions and horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Dry algae and lichen have a matte appearance. Under
            oblique lighting, the textured surface of lichen casts small shadows, enhancing its roughness.
          texture_details: Algae presents a slimy, smooth texture when wet, transitioning to a powdery or slightly crusty
            texture when dry. Lichen exhibits a rough, crusty, or foliose (leaf-like) texture, depending on the species. Microscopic
            examination reveals a porous structure in both.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 100 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 5 millimeters,
            depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: Films, patches, crusts, drip marks (algae), and circular or irregular thalli (lichen).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from non-uniform (localized patches) to moderately uniform (thin
            film).
        indium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) darkens
            to brownish-black, becomes thicker and crustier, and may exhibit signs of decomposition or mineral deposition.
            Lichen develops a more established thallus structure over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progresses from initial colonization (days/weeks) as isolated spots to expansion and
            coalescence of these spots into larger patches (months). Over longer periods (years), the growth becomes thicker,
            more complex, and may involve multiple species of algae and lichen.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#000000 black (advanced lichen/algae decomposition)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), drip marks,
            and expanding circular patches. Lichen tends to form more defined, irregular shapes compared to the often amorphous
            spread of algae.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically observed in crevices, corners, and areas with prolonged
            moisture retention. Edges and areas sheltered from direct sunlight also tend to exhibit higher concentrations.
            Flat, exposed surfaces may have lighter or no growth.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in initial stages to heavy (60-85%) or even extreme (>85%) in
            advanced stages, depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on indium surfaces manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from vibrant
            green to brownish-black. Initial growth appears as localized spots, evolving into interconnected patches with
            increasing exposure time. The overall appearance is a mottled, textured surface with varying degrees of coverage.
          distribution_patterns: Distribution patterns are influenced by moisture availability, surface roughness, and light
            exposure. Algae tends to concentrate in areas with higher moisture content, while lichen can colonize drier areas.
            Both prefer shaded locations.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit preferential growth due to increased moisture retention and
            reduced light exposure. However, the center of a large, flat surface may also support growth if moisture is consistently
            available.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Grooves and indentations provide sheltered
            microclimates that promote growth. Sharp edges may experience increased moisture accumulation, leading to higher
            concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the pattern on vertical surfaces, leading to downward flow and streaking of
            algae. Pooling of water at the base of vertical surfaces can result in concentrated growth in these areas. Lichen,
            being more firmly attached, is less affected by gravity.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte appearance as it dries.
            Lichen typically has a matte finish. Under oblique lighting, the textured surface casts shadows, enhancing the
            visual contrast.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (aged algae and lichen).
            Lichen often exhibits a foliose (leaf-like) or crustose (crust-like) texture. Algae can also present a powdery
            or gelatinous texture depending on hydration levels.
          thickness_range: Algae thickness ranges from 1-50 micrometers (fresh) to 50-200 micrometers (aged). Lichen thickness
            varies from 100 micrometers to 1 millimeter, depending on the species and age.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include thin films (algae), crusts (aged algae/lichen), patches (both), and
            drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces). Lichen can also form distinct thallus structures, such as foliose
            lobes or crustose areoles.
          uniformity_assessment: The growth is highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated colonies to dense, confluent
            patches. Uniformity is generally low, with significant variations in thickness and coverage across the surface.
        iridium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens to olive and eventually brown
            as it dries and decomposes. Lichen starts as small, light-colored spots and slowly expands into larger, darker,
            and more textured patches over months to years.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within hours to days, visible film formation within a week, significant
            buildup within a month. Lichen: Initial colonization can take months, visible spots within a year, substantial
            patch formation over several years.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#808000 olive (aging algae)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (dried lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, expanding circular patches, streaks following water flow, and uniform coating
            in humid environments.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations in crevices, corners, and areas with prolonged moisture. Lighter
            concentrations on exposed, flat surfaces. Edges often show increased growth due to water accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and exposure time. Light
            (10-30%) is common in moderately exposed areas. Moderate (30-60%) to heavy (60-85%) occurs in consistently damp
            or shaded locations.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on iridium surfaces presents as a mottled, multi-hued coating, ranging from
            vibrant greens to dull browns. The growth typically starts in localized spots and expands, often following surface
            imperfections. Lichen tends to form crusty patches, while algae can create a more slimy film.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, expanding circular patches, streaks following water flow, and uniform coating
            in humid environments. Lichen tends to colonize in more sheltered areas.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to water accumulation and reduced
            sunlight exposure. Centers of flat surfaces tend to have lower concentrations unless uniformly wet.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness and imperfections (scratches, pits) provide nucleation sites for initial growth.
            Concave surfaces retain moisture and promote heavier growth. Sharp edges can accumulate water and nutrients, leading
            to increased colonization.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of water carries algae spores and nutrients, resulting in vertical streaking. Pooling
            occurs in depressions. Lichen growth is less directly affected by gravity but can be influenced by water runoff
            patterns.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae can exhibit a slight sheen when wet. Dried algae and lichen tend to be matte. Iridescence
            is not typically observed.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially slimy and smooth, becoming rough and slightly crusty upon drying. Lichen: Crusty,
            granular, and sometimes foliose (leaf-like) with a rough texture. Both can exhibit a powdery surface when dry.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 50 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, pools (in depressions), and thin crusts. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and occasionally
            small, raised structures (apothecia).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, especially with lichen. Algae can be more uniform
            in consistently wet environments.
        iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears vibrant green and moist, becoming duller and browner with age. Lichen growth
            is slow; aged lichen may exhibit more pronounced apothecia (fruiting bodies) and increased surface coverage.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Lichen: Colonization can
            take months to years, with visible growth occurring over several years. Algae precedes lichen colonization, creating

            surface roughness.
        kevlar-reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of exposure. Over months, the algae darkens
            and may become mixed with lichen, resulting in a grey-green, crusty appearance. Aged lichen can become brittle
            and crack, revealing the underlying polymer.
          buildup_progression: 'Days: Initial algae colonization as a thin green film. Weeks: Algae spreads and thickens,
            potentially mixed with early lichen growth. Months: Lichen becomes more established, forming crusty patches. Years:
            Extensive lichen coverage, potential for cracking and flaking of the growth.'

            moisture exposure.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on Kevlar-reinforced polymer presents as a mottled green and grey-green coating,
            often concentrated in areas with moisture retention. The growth initially appears as small, discrete spots that
            coalesce over time, forming larger, irregular patches. Lichen contributes a more textured, crust-like appearance
            compared to the smoother, film-like algae.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized, with a tendency to spread from initial points of colonization. Distribution
            is heavily influenced by moisture availability and surface texture.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners tend to exhibit higher concentrations due to increased moisture retention
            and potential for nutrient accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces and crevices promote growth due to increased moisture retention. Convex surfaces
            tend to have less growth due to faster drying.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to downward flow of water and nutrients. Pooling
            occurs on horizontal surfaces and in depressions.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Exhibits a slight sheen when wet, otherwise matte. Lichen: Generally matte, with minimal
            light reflection. Under oblique lighting, the textured surface of lichen becomes more apparent.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and film-like, becoming slightly slimy when wet. Lichen: Crusty, rough,
            and sometimes powdery, with a slightly raised texture compared to the underlying polymer surface.'

        lanthanum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) becomes
            thicker, darker, and more crusty, often incorporating Lanthanum corrosion products.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (days-weeks) by algae, forming a thin film. Lichen colonization (months-years)
            follows, resulting in thicker, crustier growth. Lanthanum corrosion products become incorporated over time, darkening
            the color.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 chartreuse (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'

          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks following water flow, and uniform coatings in
            humid environments. Lichen tends to form circular or irregular patches.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations in areas with higher moisture levels, such as crevices and shaded
            areas. Lighter concentrations on exposed, dry surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in dry environments to heavy (60-85%) in humid, shaded areas.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is possible in consistently wet conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on Lanthanum surfaces typically presents as a mottled, greenish-brown coating.
            Initial growth is often localized, expanding to cover larger areas over time. The color ranges from a vibrant
            green to a dull, brownish-grey depending on the age and species.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots initially, expanding to cover larger areas. Streaks along water runoff paths.
            Lichen forms distinct patches.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation. Can spread to the center
            over time.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to increased growth in these areas.
            Surface roughness provides more attachment points for algae and lichen.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in vertical streaking patterns, especially with
            algae growth. Pooling occurs in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Aged algae and lichen have a matte appearance. Lanthanum
            corrosion products mixed in can create a dull, metallic sheen.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (aged algae and lichen).
            Lichen often exhibits a more complex, layered texture with visible thallus structures.
          thickness_range: Algae thickness ranges from 1-50 micrometers. Lichen thickness ranges from 100 micrometers to 2
            millimeters.
          typical_formations: Algae forms films and slimy coatings. Lichen forms crusts, patches, and foliose (leaf-like)
            structures.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse and patchy to nearly uniform coverage depending on environmental
            conditions.
        lead:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth appears as vibrant green or yellow patches. Over time, the color dulls to gray or
            brown as organic matter decomposes and the growth becomes thicker and more complex. Lichen colonies become larger
            and more established.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): thin film of algae. Gradual thickening (weeks-months):
            algae becomes more visible, lichen starts to establish. Mature growth (months-years): thick, complex biofilm with
            established lichen colonies and decomposing organic matter.'

            from a central point, and a general preference for shaded areas.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with prolonged moisture exposure (e.g., near dripping water
            sources, in crevices). Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the lead
            surface. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in highly favorable environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on lead surfaces present as a mottled, often patchy covering, ranging from
            vibrant greens and yellows to dull grays and browns. The growth typically starts in areas with moisture accumulation
            and organic debris, eventually spreading to form a complex, textured biofilm. Lichen often appears as crustose
            or foliose structures, while algae forms a slimy or powdery layer.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, localized, following moisture gradients, concentrated in shaded areas, and often
            found near joints or seams where water accumulates.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to moisture accumulation. Over time, the growth can
            spread towards the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, leading to higher concentrations
            of growth. Concave surfaces provide sheltered environments conducive to growth.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to gravity-driven water runoff, carrying algae
            and nutrients downwards. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker, more concentrated growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae can exhibit a slight sheen when wet. Lichen typically has a matte finish. Under oblique
            lighting, the texture of the growth becomes more pronounced, revealing the granular or crusty nature.
          texture_details: 'Algae: slimy, gelatinous when wet, powdery when dry. Lichen: crusty, granular, sometimes foliose
            (leaf-like) with a rough, uneven surface. The lead surface underneath can become pitted and corroded.'

            depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches (mixed algae and lichen), and drip marks (streaks of
            algae following water runoff). Lichen can also form small, raised structures.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The growth is rarely uniform, with significant differences in thickness,
            color, and coverage across the surface.
        lead crystal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears bright green and moist, transitioning to a duller, brownish-green and drier
            state with age. Lichen slowly expands in size and may darken with accumulated dirt and pollutants over months/years.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight, rapidly expanding under favorable
            conditions. Lichen: Initial colonization may take months, with slow but steady growth over years. Initial colonization
            by algae can prepare the surface for lichen growth.'

          description: Algae and lichen growth on lead crystal manifests as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration. Algae
            typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty, irregularly shaped patches. Coverage ranges
            from sparse to moderate, depending on environmental conditions and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, non-uniform distribution, often concentrated in areas with moisture retention or
            nutrient accumulation.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and crevices due to increased moisture retention and nutrient accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture and organic matter, leading to increased algae
            and lichen growth. Recessed areas provide shelter and promote growth.

        limestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film, darkening and browning over weeks/months. Lichen starts
            as small, light gray spots, expanding and thickening over years, potentially developing more complex structures.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of sufficient moisture and sunlight. Significant buildup occurs
            within weeks/months. Lichen: Initial colonization is slow (months/years). Visible growth and expansion occur over

          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks (especially from water runoff), uniform coating in
            consistently damp areas, concentric rings around initial growth points (lichen).
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded, damp areas (north-facing walls, under overhangs, crevices).
            Light concentration on sun-exposed, dry surfaces. Edges and corners often accumulate more moisture and thus support
            higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and time. Light (10-30%)
            is common in moderately exposed areas. Moderate (30-60%) is typical in shaded, damp locations. Heavy (60-85%)
            is observed in consistently wet and shaded environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on limestone presents as a mottled surface, ranging from vibrant greens to
            dull grays and browns. Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen creates more textured, crusty patches.
            Coverage varies greatly depending on moisture and sunlight exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Random, clustered, linear (following water flow), zonal (related to sunlight exposure), edge-preferential
            (for moisture retention).
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often prefers edges and corners due to moisture accumulation. Lichen: Can start at
            edges and expand inwards, or form isolated patches in the center of surfaces.'
          geometry_effects: Concave surfaces (depressions, pits) accumulate moisture and support more growth. Convex surfaces
            (edges, protrusions) tend to dry out faster, limiting growth. Rough surfaces provide more attachment points for
            lichen.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Lichen: Vertical surfaces may
            exhibit less growth due to reduced water retention, except where water flows consistently.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae has a slight sheen; dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but some species
            may exhibit a slight gloss when wet. Limestone underneath can affect overall reflectance.'

          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, mats, pools (in depressions). Lichen: Crusts, patches, scales, rosettes, branching
            structures (foliose/fruticose).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can be relatively uniform in consistently wet areas, but lichen is
            almost always patchy and uneven.
        magnesium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) transitions
            to darker greens, browns, and grays, becoming thicker and more crusty. Lichen may exhibit bleaching or discoloration
            in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (days-weeks) involves the formation of a thin algal film. Over months, this
            film thickens and lichen spores begin to colonize. After years, the surface can be covered in a thick, multi-layered
            crust of algae and lichen.
          color_variations:

          common_patterns: Distribution patterns include localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow,
            and uniform coating in highly humid environments. Lichen often forms concentric rings or radiating patterns.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentrations are typically found in areas with high moisture and nutrient availability,
            such as crevices, edges, and areas sheltered from direct sunlight. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, well-drained
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed environments; light (10-30%) in moderately humid areas; moderate

            or perpetually damp conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on magnesium surfaces presents as a mottled, multi-layered coating. Initial
            colonization often appears as a thin, greenish film, progressing to thicker, crusty patches with varying shades
            of green, brown, and grey. Coverage ranges from sparse to heavy depending on environmental conditions and exposure
            time.
          distribution_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, uniform coating in humid
            environments, concentric rings (lichen), radiating patterns (lichen).
          edge_center_behavior: Algae tends to favor edges and corners due to increased moisture retention. Lichen distribution
            is more variable, but often colonizes edges and crevices initially before spreading to the center of the surface.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Algae and lichen tend to accumulate in
            depressions, grooves, and corners where moisture is retained. Sharp edges may exhibit less growth due to increased
            exposure and drainage.
          gravity_influence: Gravity affects the pattern of algal growth, leading to downward flow and pooling in low-lying
            areas. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks of algal growth following the path of water runoff.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh algal growth can exhibit a slight sheen due to the moisture content.
            Lichen typically has a matte appearance, though some species may exhibit a subtle gloss when wet.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and slimy (early algal film) to rough, crusty, and sometimes powdery
            (mature lichen). Algae often creates a slippery surface, while lichen can be brittle and easily fragmented.
          thickness_range: Algal films typically range from 1-50 micrometers. Lichen thalli can range from 100 micrometers
            to several millimeters in thickness.
          typical_formations: Algae forms films, pools, and drip marks. Lichen forms crusts, patches, and occasionally fruticose
            (shrub-like) structures.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algal growth tends to be more uniform in consistently moist areas, while
            lichen distribution is often patchy and dependent on substrate irregularities.
        mahogany:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, fading to a duller, grey-green or brownish-green over

          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (early lichen)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (aged lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following grain patterns, concentrated around joints
            and edges, drip marks from water runoff.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, corners, crevices, and areas with poor ventilation.
            Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the mahogany
            surface.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on mahogany presents as a mottled, greenish-grey to brownish-black discoloration,
            often concentrated in areas with prolonged moisture exposure. The growth typically starts as small, discrete patches
            and expands to cover larger areas, exhibiting a range of textures from smooth to crusty. Lichen often appears
            as raised, textured patches, while algae tends to form a smoother, film-like coating.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, non-uniform, often following the grain of the wood. Concentrated in areas with higher
            moisture retention and lower sunlight exposure.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially, spreading towards the center as growth progresses. Edges
            often show thicker buildup due to moisture accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners accumulate more moisture, leading to higher concentrations of growth. Recessed
            areas and carvings provide sheltered environments conducive to growth.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit downward streaking from water runoff, carrying algae and lichen spores.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more standing water, promoting more uniform growth.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Matte finish, may exhibit a slight sheen when wet. Lichen: Matte finish, may appear slightly
            more reflective depending on surface texture and species.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, transitioning to a slightly rough, matte film. Lichen: Varies
            from smooth (crustose) to rough and leafy (foliose), often with a crusty or granular surface. Some lichen species
            exhibit a powdery (leprose) texture.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50 micrometers - 5 millimeters, depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, stains, streaks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, rosettes, leafy structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse and scattered to dense and confluent. Not uniform.
        manganese:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae (hours/days) appears as a vibrant green film. Over months, it darkens to olive or brown.
            Lichen (years) develops a more substantial, crusty or foliose structure, often with distinct color zoning and
            the appearance of apothecia.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (days/weeks) involves the formation of a thin algal film. Over months, this
            film thickens and may be colonized by lichen. Over years, lichen develops a more substantial structure, potentially
            covering large areas of the manganese surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#808000 olive (aging algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (lichen apothecia)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water flow, irregular patches, concentric rings around initial
            growth points, and a general tendency to concentrate in shaded or damp areas.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with prolonged
            moisture exposure. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the duration of exposure.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on manganese surfaces presents as a mottled, multi-hued coating, ranging from
            vibrant greens to subdued browns and grays. The growth often appears in localized patches and streaks, influenced
            by moisture and surface irregularities, creating a complex and uneven visual texture.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, streaked, localized, and sometimes forming a continuous film. Distribution is heavily
            influenced by surface moisture, light exposure, and nutrient availability.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations of growth due to increased moisture
            retention and nutrient accumulation. Flat, central surfaces may have lower coverage, especially in well-drained
            areas.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more moisture and organic matter, leading to increased growth.
            Surface irregularities, such as scratches or pits, provide ideal nucleation sites for algae and lichen.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae spores and nutrients downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns.
            Pooling of water in depressions promotes localized growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish as it dries. Lichen
            generally has a matte appearance, although apothecia may exhibit a subtle gloss.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Fresh algae is often slimy and smooth. Mature algae can become
            rough and slightly crusty. Lichen exhibits a crusty or foliose (leaf-like) texture, with apothecia (fruiting bodies)
            appearing as small, raised discs.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (mature). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 5 millimeters,
            depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches, spots, and streaks. Lichen can also form more complex
            three-dimensional structures, such as foliose lobes or fruticose branches (though less common on flat manganese
            surfaces).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranging from sparse and scattered to dense and confluent, depending on environmental
            conditions and the age of the growth.
        maple:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, fading to darker greens and browns as it ages and
            accumulates dirt. Lichen slowly expands in size, with older sections potentially becoming bleached or discolored
            due to environmental factors.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization by algae within days/weeks of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Lichen
            colonization is slower, taking months to years to establish visible growth. Buildup progresses gradually, with
            algae providing a substrate for lichen establishment.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (crustose lichen)'
          - '#808000 olive (mixed algae/lichen)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (foliose lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following grain patterns, more pronounced growth in
            areas with moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations in shaded areas, near ground level, and in areas with poor ventilation.
            Lighter concentrations on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the maple
            surface. Extreme (>85%) is rare but possible in consistently damp, shaded environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on maple presents as a mottled surface with shades of green and grey, often
            concentrated in shaded or damp areas. Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty
            or leafy patches. The overall effect is a gradual discoloration and roughening of the maple surface.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily on north-facing surfaces or areas with consistent shade and moisture. Concentrated
            along grain lines and in depressions where water accumulates.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations of algae and lichen due to increased
            moisture retention and reduced sunlight exposure. Center areas of large, flat surfaces may have lower concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture, leading to increased algae and lichen growth.
            Recessed areas and grooves provide sheltered environments.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth can exhibit downward streaking due to water runoff. Lichen growth is less directly
            affected by gravity but may be influenced by water flow patterns.
          lighting_effects: Algae tends to have a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen generally has a matte
            appearance, with some species exhibiting a subtle gloss.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rougher with accumulated debris. Lichen:
            Varies from crustose (tightly adhering, rough) to foliose (leafy, slightly raised) and fruticose (bushy, branching).
            May exhibit a powdery or granular surface.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Crustose Lichen: 50-500 micrometers. Foliose Lichen: 100 micrometers
            - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, sometimes forming drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, rosettes, or small,
            branching structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in ideal conditions, but lichen
            growth is typically patchy and uneven.
        marble:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, darkening and becoming more brown or black over time.
            Fresh lichen is often lighter in color and becomes darker and more textured as it matures, sometimes exhibiting
            bleaching or discoloration due to UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization (days-weeks) by algae, forming a thin film. Lichen colonization follows
            (months-years), starting as small spots and gradually expanding. Over years, the growth becomes thicker, more
            textured, and can cause staining and etching of the marble surface.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged lichen)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (bleached/weathered lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water runoff, patchy coverage in shaded areas, uniform coating
            in consistently damp environments, concentric rings around initial growth points.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, corners, crevices, and areas with poor drainage.
            Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the marble
            structure. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) are common in many environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on marble manifests as a spectrum of green, grey, and brown hues, often forming
            patchy or streaked patterns. Algae tends to create a slimy film, while lichen forms more crusty, textured growths.
            The growth is often concentrated in areas with moisture and shade.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks following water flow, patches in shaded areas, colonization along mortar joints,
            overall coverage on porous or damaged marble.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations of growth due to increased moisture
            retention and nutrient accumulation. Centers of large, flat surfaces may have less growth initially.
          geometry_effects: Recessed areas and horizontal surfaces accumulate more moisture and organic matter, promoting
            growth. Overhangs and vertical surfaces may exhibit streaking due to water runoff.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae and nutrients downwards, creating vertical streaks. Pooling of water
            in depressions leads to localized algal blooms and lichen colonization.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, otherwise matte. Lichen: Typically matte, but some
            species may have a slight gloss when hydrated. The marble itself can lose its polish under heavy growth.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rough with biofilm development. Lichen: Ranges
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leaf-like, slightly raised), often with a rough, granular
            or powdery surface. Marble surface underneath can be etched.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (biofilm), up to 200 micrometers in thicker mats. Lichen: 100 micrometers
            to 5 millimeters, depending on species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, slimy patches, drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, small leaf-like structures
            (foliose lichen), granular coatings.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can be relatively uniform in consistently wet areas, while lichen
            tends to be more patchy and localized.
        mdf:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (days/weeks) appears vibrant green (algae) or light grey (lichen). Aged growth (months/years)
            darkens to brownish-grey, becomes more crusty, and may exhibit signs of MDF degradation (swelling, warping).
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days/weeks): Small, isolated spots of algae or lichen. Expansion (weeks/months):
            Patches grow and coalesce, forming larger areas of coverage. Maturation (months/years): Growth thickens, darkens,
            and may lead to MDF degradation. Substrate damage becomes increasingly visible.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'

          - '#A0522D sienna (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (MDF substrate discoloration)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, and a general tendency to colonize
            areas with prolonged moisture exposure.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded, damp areas and areas with poor ventilation. Lighter concentration
            on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and duration of exposure.
            Light (10-30%) is common in early stages. Moderate (30-60%) is typical in moderately humid environments. Heavy
            (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) occur in consistently damp or shaded locations.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on MDF presents as a mottled, greenish-grey to brownish discoloration, often
            concentrated in areas of moisture accumulation. The growth typically starts as small, discrete patches and expands
            to cover larger areas, exhibiting a rough, textured surface. Lichen tends to form crust-like structures, while
            algae appears as a slimy or powdery film.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy, often concentrated along edges, corners, and areas where water tends
            to accumulate or drip.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often preferred due to increased moisture retention and reduced airflow.
            Center areas may exhibit growth if the entire surface remains consistently damp.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges provide sheltered microclimates that promote initial colonization. Horizontal
            surfaces accumulate more moisture, leading to heavier growth compared to vertical surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae spores and nutrients downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns.
            Pooling of water in depressions leads to localized areas of heavy growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Dried algae and lichen are generally matte. Under
            oblique lighting, the textured surface of lichen casts small shadows, enhancing its granular appearance.
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially slimy and smooth, transitioning to powdery or slightly rough as it dries. Lichen:
            Crusty, granular, and often exhibiting a slightly raised, three-dimensional texture. MDF surface becomes softened
            and potentially delaminated beneath the growth.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 5-50 micrometers (thin film). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters (crustose forms).
            MDF degradation can extend several millimeters into the substrate.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, powdery deposits, and sometimes drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and
            occasionally small, leaf-like structures (foliose forms, less common on MDF).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from sparse, isolated colonies to dense, confluent mats. Uniformity
            depends heavily on environmental conditions and surface orientation.
        metal matrix composites mmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film, transitioning to a darker, duller green or brown as
            it ages and dries. Lichen develops slowly, starting as small, inconspicuous spots and gradually expanding into
            larger, more defined crusts over months or years. Aged lichen may exhibit cracking and flaking.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization occurs within days to weeks, with algae forming a thin film. Lichen colonization
            is slower, taking months to years to establish visible colonies. Over time, the growth thickens and expands, potentially
            leading to significant surface coverage and biocorrosion. Algae can appear within days of exposure to moisture
            and light, while lichen requires longer periods (months to years) to establish visible colonies.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (mature algae)'
          - '#808080 gray (lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (aged lichen)'
          - '#006400 dark green (algae in shaded areas)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water runoff, irregular patches, and a general tendency to colonize
            crevices and surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in crevices, corners, and areas with standing water. Lighter concentration
            on exposed, smooth surfaces that dry quickly. Shaded areas tend to support denser algal growth.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the MMC surface.
            Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is common in moderately humid environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on MMCs presents as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from vibrant green to
            dull gray-green, often with localized patches and streaks. The growth is typically concentrated in areas with
            moisture retention and nutrient accumulation, creating a mottled appearance. Lichen tends to be more crust-like
            and persistent than algae.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential growth in areas with moisture retention, such as crevices,
            joints, and areas sheltered from direct sunlight. Growth is often denser near the base of structures where water
            tends to accumulate.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often preferred locations for initial colonization due to increased
            moisture retention and nutrient accumulation. The center of large, flat surfaces may exhibit lower growth density
            due to faster drying.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners provide ideal locations for initial colonization and subsequent growth.
            Concave surfaces and depressions trap moisture and nutrients, promoting denser growth. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            streaking due to gravity-driven water runoff.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae and the accumulation
            of moisture and nutrients at the base of vertical surfaces. This results in denser growth at the bottom and thinner
            growth higher up.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with
            minimal light reflection. The underlying MMC surface may show altered reflectivity due to the presence of the
            biological growth.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and slightly powdery when dry. Lichen: Crusty,
            granular, and sometimes foliose (leaf-like) with a rough, uneven surface. The MMC surface underneath may exhibit
            pitting due to biocorrosion.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50-500 micrometers, potentially reaching 1-2 millimeters in mature
            colonies.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, patches, and sometimes drip marks following water flow. Lichen: Crusts, patches,
            and occasionally foliose structures. Both can form biofilms that trap dirt and debris.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated patches to near-complete coverage in favorable
            conditions. Uniformity is generally low due to variations in surface texture, moisture availability, and nutrient
            distribution.
        molybdenum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green, almost translucent film. Over time (days/weeks), it darkens
            to a duller green or brown, becoming more opaque and crusty. Lichen, developing over months/years, forms a more
            permanent, textured layer with varying colors and patterns.
          buildup_progression: Initial colonization by algae (hours/days), followed by a gradual increase in coverage and
            thickness (days/weeks). Lichen colonization is slower (months/years), with a gradual expansion of thallus size
            and density.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (dried lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water flow, and a general tendency to concentrate
            in crevices and areas with prolonged moisture.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with standing water, crevices, and shaded regions. Lighter
            concentration on exposed, well-ventilated surfaces. Edges and corners often show increased buildup due to capillary
            action and moisture retention.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), rarely extreme (>85%) unless the environment is exceptionally
            conducive to growth.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on molybdenum surfaces presents as a mottled, multi-hued coating, ranging from
            vibrant greens to dull browns. Coverage varies significantly, often concentrated in areas with moisture retention.
            The texture transitions from a slimy film to a crusty, uneven layer as the growth matures.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, non-uniform, often following the contours of the molybdenum surface. Concentrated
            in areas with higher humidity and lower direct sunlight. Can exhibit concentric ring patterns in some lichen species.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased moisture retention and reduced direct sunlight
            exposure. The center of large, flat surfaces may exhibit less growth due to faster drying.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness promotes algae and lichen growth by providing increased surface area and trapping
            moisture. Concave surfaces and crevices are particularly susceptible. Sharp edges may experience accelerated growth
            due to increased moisture condensation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae and lichen growth,
            especially on vertical surfaces. Pooling of water at the base of structures promotes localized heavy growth.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Dried algae and lichen have a matte appearance.
            The underlying molybdenum surface may show altered reflectivity due to the growth.
          texture_details: Initially, algae forms a smooth, slimy film. As it dries and ages, it becomes rough and slightly
            crusty. Lichen exhibits a more complex texture, ranging from smooth, leathery thallus to granular or powdery soredia.
            The molybdenum surface underneath may exhibit pitting or etching due to biological activity.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), 50-200 micrometers (aged). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (aged algae/lichen), patches (lichen), and occasional drip marks from
            water runoff carrying algal spores or lichen propagules.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from sparse, isolated patches to a nearly continuous coating, depending
            on environmental conditions and time.
        mortar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film, fading to a duller green or brown over time. Lichen
            starts as small, inconspicuous spots, gradually expanding and thickening over months to years. Aged lichen may
            exhibit cracking and fragmentation.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: visible within days of moisture exposure, reaching significant coverage within weeks.
            Lichen: colonization is a slow process, with visible growth taking months to years. Initial colonization by pioneer
            species prepares the surface for subsequent colonization by other species.'

            can colonize both edges and center, depending on species and surface conditions.'
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities such as pores and cracks provide ideal microhabitats for initial colonization.
            Edges and corners accumulate moisture, promoting growth.
          gravity_influence: Algae growth often exhibits downward streaking due to water runoff. Lichen growth is generally
            less affected by gravity once established.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: exhibits a slight sheen when wet, matte when dry. Lichen: generally matte, but some species
            may have a slight gloss. Color saturation increases when wet.'

          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (algae film) to highly variable (lichen patches).
        neodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant green film. Aged growth (months/years) darkens
            to brownish-black, thickens, and becomes more crusty or leathery. Lichen may develop distinct thallus structures
            with visible fruiting bodies (apothecia).
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (days/weeks) involves the formation of a thin, green algal film. Over months,
            lichen colonization begins, leading to the development of crusty patches. After years, the growth becomes thicker,
            darker, and more extensive, potentially causing significant surface degradation of the neodymium.

          - '#000000 black (advanced lichen/algae decomposition)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks running vertically due to gravity-driven water
            flow, and irregular patches that expand over time. Growth is often observed along edges, corners, and crevices
            where moisture tends to accumulate.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with prolonged moisture exposure, such as shaded areas, crevices,
            and near joints. Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces where evaporation is higher.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in dry, exposed environments to extreme (>85%) in humid, shaded
            conditions. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are common in moderately humid environments.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on neodymium surfaces manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from vibrant
            green to brownish-black. The growth is typically localized, forming irregular patches and streaks, often concentrated
            in areas with moisture accumulation. The color and texture vary significantly depending on the specific species
            and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches, streaks, edge concentration, crevice filling, and irregular expansion
            from initial nucleation points.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased moisture retention and nutrient accumulation. The
            center of large, flat surfaces may exhibit lower growth rates due to faster drying.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote moisture retention, leading to increased growth. Concave surfaces
            and depressions act as collection points for water and nutrients, fostering algal and lichen colonization. Smooth,
            vertical surfaces tend to exhibit streaking due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in vertical streaking of algae and lichen growth.
            Pooling occurs in depressions and horizontal surfaces. Spores and propagules are also dispersed downwards by gravity
            and rain.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish when dry. Lichen
            generally has a matte appearance. Under oblique lighting, the rough texture of lichen becomes more pronounced,
            casting small shadows.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (established lichen).
            Algae often presents a gelatinous or powdery surface when dry, while lichen forms a more rigid, crustose or foliose
            structure. The neodymium surface underneath may exhibit pitting or etching due to biocorrosion.
          thickness_range: Algae thickness ranges from 1-50 micrometers. Lichen thickness varies from 50 micrometers to 2
            millimeters, depending on the species and age.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), thin films (early algae growth), crusts (mature lichen), patches
            (irregularly shaped colonies), and pools (localized accumulation of algae in depressions).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse isolated colonies to dense, confluent growth. Uniformity
            is rare, except in highly controlled laboratory conditions.

          concentration_variations: 'Algae: Heavy concentration in areas with constant moisture, light concentration in drier,
            sun-exposed areas. Lichen: Higher concentration on rough surfaces and in areas sheltered from direct sunlight
            and rain.'
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the surface.
            Light (10-30%) is common in drier environments, while moderate (30-60%) to heavy (60-85%) coverage is typical
            in consistently damp or shaded areas.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on nickel surfaces presents as a heterogeneous mixture of green, brown, and

            May start at edges or in the center of a surface, depending on spore dispersal patterns and surface conditions.'
          geometry_effects: 'Algae: Accumulates in depressions and along edges where moisture collects. Lichen: Colonizes
            flat or slightly inclined surfaces, avoiding sharp edges and areas with frequent abrasion.'
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Pooling occurs in low-lying areas.
            Lichen: Less affected by gravity once established, but initial spore settlement may be influenced by wind and
            rain patterns.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, but some
            species may have a slight gloss when wet.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and sometimes powdery when dry. Lichen: Crusty,

            foliose (leaf-like) structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable; neither algae nor lichen forms a perfectly uniform coating. Distribution
            is patchy and dependent on microclimate and surface irregularities.
        phenolic resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Aged algae darkens
            to olive or brownish-green over months, often mixed with sediment. Lichen develops slowly over months/years, starting
            as small spots and expanding into larger, crusty formations.

            small, raised structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated spots to near-uniform coverage, depending on environmental
            factors.
        pine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae is vibrant green, fading to brownish-green and eventually brown as it dies. Lichen
            growth is slow; fresh lichen is typically lighter in color, becoming darker and more textured with age. Dead lichen

          description: Algae and lichen growth on pine presents as a mottled surface with shades of green, grey, and brown.
            Algae typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. The growth is often
            concentrated in areas with higher moisture and lower sunlight exposure.
          distribution_patterns: Concentrated on north-facing surfaces, shaded areas, and areas with poor ventilation. Often
            found near the base of the pine or in areas where water accumulates.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially, spreading towards the center as growth progresses.
          geometry_effects: Growth is more pronounced in recessed areas and along edges where moisture tends to accumulate.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to water runoff.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks. Lichen: Growth is generally less affected by
            gravity, but larger foliose lichens may droop slightly.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Glossy when wet, matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with slight sheen possible on

          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, sometimes forming drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches, small leafy structures,
            or hair-like strands.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Can range from sparse, isolated patches to a near-uniform coating, depending
            on environmental conditions.
        plaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens to a brownish-green or brown.
            Lichen growth is slow; young lichen appears as small, indistinct spots, gradually expanding and developing characteristic
            features over months to years. Aged lichen may become brittle and cracked.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization occurs within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Visible
            film forms within weeks. Significant buildup occurs within months. Lichen: Colonization is slow, taking months
            to years for visible growth to appear. Buildup progresses gradually over years, with lichen thalli expanding and
            developing characteristic features.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CB342 olive green (fresh algae)'
          - '#558B2F dark green (mature algae)'
          - '#A9A9A9 light gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#808080 gray (lichen apothecia)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks (especially below water runoff), and overall discoloration.
            Lichen often forms circular or radiating patterns.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with high moisture, such as shaded areas, near gutters, and
            in crevices. Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Edges and corners often accumulate more moisture
            and thus support higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the plaster.
            Light (10-30%) is common in drier climates or on well-maintained surfaces. Moderate (30-60%) to heavy (60-85%)
            is typical in humid environments or on neglected surfaces.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on plaster presents as a mottled, greenish-gray to brownish discoloration.
            Algae typically appears as a slimy film, while lichen forms crusty or leafy patches. Coverage ranges from sparse
            spots to extensive coatings, depending on environmental conditions and plaster composition.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches, streaks below water sources, overall discoloration, circular or radiating
            patterns (lichen).
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often concentrated along edges and in corners where moisture accumulates. Lichen:
            Can be found in both edges and center, depending on the species and surface characteristics. Some lichen species
            prefer exposed surfaces, while others thrive in sheltered areas.'
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities, such as cracks and pores, provide ideal locations for algae and lichen
            to establish. Overhangs and sheltered areas retain moisture, promoting growth. Rough surfaces offer better adhesion
            for lichen.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Pooling of water in depressions
            leads to localized concentrations. Lichen: Less directly affected by gravity, but water runoff can influence nutrient
            distribution and growth patterns.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally
            matte, but some species may have a slightly glossy surface, especially when wet. The presence of apothecia (fruiting
            bodies) can create small reflective points.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and slightly crusty when dry. Lichen: Varies
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crust-like) to foliose (leafy, loosely attached) with a rough, often granular
            or scaly surface. Some lichen species exhibit a powdery (sorediate) texture.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-10 micrometers (film), up to 100 micrometers (thick crust). Lichen: 0.1-5 millimeters,
            depending on species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, stains, crusts, and slimy patches. Lichen: Crusts, patches, leafy structures
            (foliose), and small, raised fruiting bodies (apothecia).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae tends to be more uniform in areas with consistent moisture, while
            lichen distribution is more patchy and dependent on surface irregularities and nutrient availability.
        platinum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours/days. Over months, it darkens to brown
            and may be replaced by lichen. Aged lichen forms thicker, more textured crusts over years, potentially exhibiting
            color variations and layered structures.
          buildup_progression: Initial algae film forms within days. Algae thickens over weeks. Lichen colonization begins
            within months. Lichen thallus thickens and expands over years, potentially forming complex, layered structures.
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (maturing algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/early lichen)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen thallus)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (dead algae/lichen residue)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, concentric rings (lichen),
            and a general tendency to concentrate in areas with higher moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with high moisture, nutrient availability, and surface roughness.
            Lighter concentration on smooth, exposed surfaces. Edges, corners, and crevices tend to accumulate more growth.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and exposure time. Extreme
            coverage (>85%) is possible in highly favorable environments over extended periods.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on platinum results in a heterogeneous surface coating, initially appearing
            as a thin, greenish-brown film that evolves into a textured, multi-colored crust. The growth is often localized
            and follows moisture patterns, with dominant colors ranging from olive green to dark brown. Lichen, in particular,
            forms distinct, often circular, patches.
          distribution_patterns: Localized, patchy, and often concentrated along edges, crevices, and areas with prolonged
            moisture exposure. Lichen tends to form distinct colonies, while algae can spread more diffusely.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas with higher moisture retention. Centers of flat surfaces are generally
            less susceptible to initial colonization.
          geometry_effects: Surface roughness promotes growth by providing more surface area and trapping moisture. Concave
            surfaces and crevices accumulate more biomass. Sharp edges can act as nucleation points for lichen colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae. Pooling occurs
            in depressions. Lichen growth is less directly influenced by gravity but can be affected by water runoff patterns.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish when dry. Lichen
            generally has a matte appearance, although some species may exhibit a subtle gloss. No significant iridescence
            is observed.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and slimy (algae), transitioning to rough, crusty, and sometimes foliose (lichen).
            Algae can be powdery when dried. Lichen thalli exhibit a range of textures from smooth to granular.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, pools in depressions, drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, patches (crustose, foliose),
            and occasionally fruticose structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Algae can form relatively uniform films in some areas, but overall, the
            growth is non-uniform. Lichen growth is inherently patchy and non-uniform.
        plywood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within days of moisture exposure. Over months, it darkens
            and becomes mixed with dirt and debris. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months to years to establish visible
            patches. Aged lichen may become brittle and cracked, with the underlying plywood showing signs of rot and decay.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of moisture exposure, forming a thin green film. Buildup
            progresses rapidly under favorable conditions, reaching moderate coverage within weeks. Lichen: Colonization is
            slower, with visible patches appearing after months or years. Buildup progresses gradually, with colonies expanding
            and merging over time.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'

          - '#A9A9A9 dark grey (aged lichen)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (underlying plywood discoloration)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and patches, streaks following grain direction, drip marks from water runoff, and
            overall irregular coverage.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded areas, near ground level, and in areas where water pools
            or drips. Lighter concentration on exposed, well-drained surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the plywood.
            Extreme coverage (>85%) is possible in highly favorable environments with prolonged moisture exposure.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on plywood presents as a mottled green and grey-green coating, often concentrated
            in areas with prolonged moisture exposure. Algae appears as a slimy film, while lichen forms crusty or leafy patches,
            both contributing to surface discoloration and degradation.
          distribution_patterns: Patchy, non-uniform distribution, often concentrated in areas with poor drainage or shading.
            Algae tends to spread more readily across the surface, while lichen forms more distinct, localized colonies.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased moisture retention and reduced sunlight exposure.
            The center of large panels may exhibit lower growth rates due to better drainage and ventilation.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, leading to higher concentrations
            of algae and lichen. Horizontal surfaces are more susceptible to pooling water and supporting growth than vertical
            surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes water to flow downward, creating streaks of algae and lichen growth. Pooling occurs
            in depressions and low-lying areas, promoting localized colonization.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with
            some species showing a slight gloss when hydrated. The underlying plywood may appear dull and faded.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming slightly rough with accumulated debris. Lichen: Ranges
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leafy, with distinct lobes), exhibiting a rough, uneven texture.
            Plywood surface underneath shows signs of weathering and fiber separation.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 10-50 micrometers (fresh film), up to 200 micrometers (with debris). Lichen: 0.1-2 millimeters,
            depending on species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, slimy patches, and drip marks. Lichen: Crusts, leafy patches, and small,
            raised bumps. Both can contribute to the formation of a biofilm on the plywood surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse isolated spots to dense, confluent patches. Uniformity
            is generally low due to variations in moisture, sunlight, and nutrient availability.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae (hours/days) is bright green and hydrated. Aged algae (weeks/months) darkens to olive
            or brown and becomes brittle. Fresh lichen (months) is small and light-colored. Aged lichen (years) expands, darkens,
            and may develop complex structures.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Visible film
            within 1-2 weeks. Significant buildup within 1-3 months. Lichen: Initial colonization can take months to years.
            Visible patches within 6-12 months. Significant growth over several years.'

            Lichen: Isolated patches, expanding circular colonies, often concentrated along edges and seams.'
          concentration_variations: 'Algae: Heaviest in areas with standing water, shade, and nutrient accumulation (e.g.,
            near edges, corners, and crevices). Lighter on exposed, sunlit surfaces. Lichen: Concentrated in areas with stable
            moisture and minimal disturbance.'
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and time. Light (10-30%)
            is common in early stages. Moderate (30-60%) is typical in moderately humid environments. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme
            (>85%) occur in consistently wet and shaded conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on polycarbonate presents as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration. Algae
            typically forms a thin, slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty or leafy patches. Coverage ranges from sparse
            to heavy depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: Random, localized, edge-concentrated, streak-like (algae), circular (lichen), and influenced
            by surface imperfections.
          edge_center_behavior: 'Algae: Often prefers edges and corners due to moisture accumulation. Lichen: Can colonize
            both edges and center, depending on species and microclimate.'
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges accumulate more moisture and debris, promoting algae and lichen growth. Recessed
            areas provide shelter and retain moisture, favoring colonization.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks. Pooling occurs in low-lying areas. Lichen: Less
            directly affected by gravity, but water runoff can influence nutrient distribution.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dry algae is matte. Lichen: Generally matte, with some
            species exhibiting a slight gloss on apothecia. No iridescence observed.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rough and slightly crusty upon drying. Lichen: Varies
            from crustose (tightly adhering, crust-like) to foliose (leafy, loosely attached) with a rough, sometimes granular

        polyester resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears bright green and slimy within days. Over months, it darkens to a dull green-brown
            and becomes drier. Lichen develops slowly over years, starting as small spots and expanding into larger, crusty
            formations.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Visible within days of exposure to moisture and sunlight. Lichen: Takes months to years
            to establish visible colonies. Buildup progresses from small spots to larger, interconnected patches over time.'

          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks following water runoff, and a general green or brown
            discoloration across the surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with prolonged moisture exposure.
            Lighter concentrations on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%) depending on environmental conditions and maintenance practices.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on polyester resin composites manifests as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration.
            Algae typically forms a slimy film, while lichen appears as crusty patches. Coverage ranges from sparse to heavy
            depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: Random distribution, often concentrated in areas with moisture retention or nutrient accumulation.
            Can also follow the grain of the composite material.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to moisture accumulation and reduced
            UV exposure.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, leading to increased algae and
            lichen growth. Recessed areas provide sheltered environments.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water creates streaks and drip marks. Lichen: Growth is generally less
            affected by gravity but may be slightly more pronounced on vertical surfaces.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Wet algae exhibits a slight sheen. Dried algae and lichen are generally matte. No iridescence
            is typically observed.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, transitioning to rough and slightly sticky as it dries. Lichen:
            Crusty, granular, and sometimes slightly powdery.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh), up to 200 micrometers (dried). Lichen: 100 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, streaks, and pools. Lichen: Crusts, patches, and occasionally small, raised structures
            (apothecia).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated patches to near-uniform coverage in heavily affected
            areas.
        polyethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film. Over time, it darkens to brown or black. Lichen starts
            as small, inconspicuous spots and gradually expands, often bleaching to a lighter gray or white with age due to
            UV exposure.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Small, isolated spots of algae or lichen. Expansion (weeks-months):
            Spots grow and coalesce, forming larger patches. Maturation (months-years): Patches thicken, and lichen species
            become more prominent, potentially leading to significant surface coverage.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#3CB371 medium sea green (established algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen thallus)'
          - '#D3D3D3 light gray (bleached lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, expanding patches, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), drip marks, and
            a general tendency to follow surface imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations in shaded areas, areas with moisture retention, and near sources
            of nutrients (e.g., dust accumulation). Lighter concentrations on exposed, dry surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the polyethylene
            surface.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on polyethylene presents as a mottled, often greenish or brownish discoloration.
            Initial growth appears as localized spots, evolving into larger, interconnected patches with varied textures.
            The color and texture depend heavily on the specific species and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Localized patches, streaks on vertical surfaces, accumulation in depressions, and colonization
            along edges and seams.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners initially, then spreads towards the center. Crevices and imperfections
            are primary colonization sites.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more growth due to increased moisture retention and dust
            accumulation. Depressions and scratches provide ideal starting points for colonization.
          gravity_influence: Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking patterns due to water runoff carrying algae and lichen spores
            downwards. Pooling can occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte,
            but some species may have a slight gloss. No iridescence is typically observed.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rougher and more textured as it dries. Lichen: Crusty,
            granular, or foliose (leaf-like) depending on the species. Can be powdery or have a slightly rubbery feel.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh film), up to 200 micrometers (thick, established growth). Lichen:
            100 micrometers - 5 millimeters, depending on species and age.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, slimy patches, and sometimes thicker, crust-like formations. Lichen: Crusts,
            patches, and occasionally small, leaf-like structures (foliose lichen).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, typically patchy and uneven.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh growth (hours/days) is typically a vibrant green and easily wiped away. Aged growth (months/years)
            darkens to brown or gray, becomes more firmly attached, and may develop a crusty or flaky texture.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days/weeks): Sparse, localized spots of green algae. Expansion (weeks/months):
            Spots coalesce, forming larger patches. Maturation (months/years): Algae darkens, lichen colonizes, forming crusty
            or flaky layers.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#228B22 forest green (established algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#D2B48C tan (lichen thallus)'
          - '#A9A9A9 dark gray (lichen fruiting bodies)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots that expand and coalesce, streaks caused by water runoff, and irregular patches.
            Lichen often forms circular or irregular thalli.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in shaded areas, crevices, and areas with prolonged
            moisture exposure. Lighter concentrations on exposed, sunlit surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the growth.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on polypropylene presents as a mottled, often greenish or brownish discoloration.
            Initially appearing as sparse spots, it can evolve into a confluent coating, particularly in humid environments.
            The color and texture vary significantly based on the specific species and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Initially localized around imperfections or areas of higher moisture. Progresses to cover
            larger areas, often following the contours of the polypropylene surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are often the first areas colonized due to increased moisture retention
            and debris accumulation. The center of large, flat surfaces may be colonized later.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more moisture and debris, promoting initial growth. Textured
            surfaces provide more surface area for attachment.
          gravity_influence: Water runoff carries algae spores and nutrients downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns.
            Pooling occurs in depressions and horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae often exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Aged algae and lichen tend to be matte. The
            presence of fruiting bodies in lichen can create subtle variations in light reflection.
          texture_details: Ranges from smooth and slimy (fresh algae) to rough and crusty (aged algae/lichen). Lichen often
            exhibits a more complex texture with small, raised structures (fruiting bodies) or a granular surface.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50 micrometers - 2 millimeters.'
          typical_formations: Algae forms films, pools in depressions, and drip marks along vertical surfaces. Lichen forms
            crusts, patches, and occasionally small, raised structures (fruiting bodies).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, especially in the early stages of colonization.
            Can become more uniform over time with extensive coverage.
        polystyrene:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh algae (hours/days): Bright green, slimy. Aged algae (months/years): Darker green to olive
            or brown, drier, and more crust-like. Fresh lichen (months): Light brown or greenish-gray, small, and tightly
            adhered. Aged lichen (years): Darker brown, larger, more distinct lobes, and potentially brittle.'
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days/weeks): Small, isolated spots of algae or lichen. Expansion (months):
            Spots merge and grow, forming larger patches. Maturation (years): Patches thicken, lichen develops more complex
            structures, and the overall appearance becomes more established and potentially damaging to the polystyrene.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 chartreuse (fresh algae)'
          - '#3CB371 medium sea green (mature algae)'
          - '#808000 olive (aged algae)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen)'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown (aged lichen)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), and a general tendency
            to follow surface contours and imperfections.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in areas with moisture accumulation (e.g., depressions, shaded areas).
            Lighter concentration on exposed, dry surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common, but heavy (>60%) coverage can occur in highly
            favorable conditions.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on polystyrene presents as a mottled, greenish-brown discoloration, often starting
            as small, localized spots and expanding into larger, irregular patches. The growth exhibits a range of textures
            from smooth films to crusty formations, depending on the species and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized, patchy, and non-uniform. Favors areas with moisture retention and nutrient
            availability.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially, then spreads towards the center of the surface as growth
            progresses.
          geometry_effects: Corners and edges tend to accumulate more growth due to increased moisture retention and debris
            accumulation. Grooves and indentations provide sheltered environments for colonization.
          gravity_influence: 'Algae: Downward flow of water can create streaks and drip marks, especially on vertical surfaces.
            Lichen: Less affected by gravity once established, but initial spore dispersal can be influenced by wind and water
            flow.'
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Fresh growth exhibits a slight sheen when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally
            matte, with some species exhibiting a slight gloss when hydrated.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, transitioning to a slightly rough, biofilm-like texture. Lichen:
            Ranges from crustose (tightly adhering, crusty) to foliose (leafy, with distinct lobes), exhibiting a rough, uneven
            surface. Some species may appear powdery.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 10-50 micrometers (biofilm), up to 200 micrometers in thicker patches. Lichen: 100 micrometers
            - 2 millimeters, depending on the species and growth form.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Films, patches, and sometimes drip marks on vertical surfaces. Lichen: Crusts, patches,
            and occasionally small, leafy structures.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from nearly absent to dense coverage in localized areas. Overall,
            non-uniform.
        polytetrafluoroethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a bright green film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Aged algae (months/years)
            darkens to brown, becomes brittle, and may flake off. Lichen develops slowly over years, forming a more permanent,
            crusty layer.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial colonization (days-weeks): Sparse, isolated spots of algae. Intermediate growth (weeks-months):
            Expansion of algae colonies, formation of streaks and patches. Advanced growth (months-years): Confluent algae
            mats, lichen colonization, potential for PTFE discoloration and degradation.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 chartreuse (fresh algae)'
          - '#3CB371 medium sea green (established algae)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (aged algae/lichen)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (lichen)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (PTFE discoloration under growth)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks (especially on inclined surfaces), irregular patches, and confluent growth
            forming a continuous layer in humid conditions.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found in crevices, corners, and areas sheltered from
            direct sunlight and wind. Lighter concentrations occur on exposed, smooth surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and exposure time.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on PTFE presents as a heterogeneous mix of green and brown patches. Initial
            colonization appears as scattered spots, evolving into a more confluent, textured layer over time, often concentrated
            in areas with moisture accumulation. The color ranges from vibrant green to dull brown depending on the species
            and age.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, patchy, and often concentrated in areas with higher moisture retention or surface
            imperfections.
          edge_center_behavior: Edges and corners are generally preferred due to increased moisture retention and reduced
            exposure to direct sunlight.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences growth. Grooves, edges, and corners provide sheltered
            microclimates that promote colonization. Flat, exposed surfaces are less susceptible.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of algae. Pooling occurs
            in depressions and horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh algae exhibits a slight sheen when wet. Aged algae and lichen are generally matte. PTFE
            underneath the growth may show a slight discoloration, appearing duller than the surrounding clean surface.
          texture_details: Initially, algae presents a smooth, almost slimy texture. As it ages and dries, it becomes rougher
            and more powdery. Lichen exhibits a crusty, sometimes foliose (leaf-like) texture, adhering tightly to the PTFE
            surface.
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers. Lichen: 50-500 micrometers.'
          typical_formations: Films (algae), crusts (lichen), patches, and streaks (due to water runoff). Algae can form gelatinous
            pools in depressions.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated colonies to dense, confluent mats.
        polyvinyl chloride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh algae appears as a vibrant green film within hours/days of moisture exposure. Aged algae
            darkens to olive green or brown over months/years. Lichen colonization is slower, taking months/years to establish
            visible thalli, which then thicken and spread over decades.
          buildup_progression: 'Algae: Initial colonization within hours/days, visible film within a week, significant buildup
            within months. Lichen: Initial colonization can take months/years, visible thallus formation within 1-2 years,
            significant growth over decades.'
          color_variations:
          - '#7CFC00 lime green (fresh algae)'
          - '#32CD32 lime green (mature algae)'
          - '#808000 olive green (aged algae)'
          - '#A0522D sienna brown (lichen thallus)'
          - '#696969 dim gray (lichen apothecia)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water runoff, uniform coating in humid environments, concentric
            rings expanding from initial colonization points.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration in shaded, damp areas, corners, and crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Lighter concentration on exposed, sunlit surfaces due to desiccation.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on environmental conditions and the age of the PVC surface.
            New PVC is less susceptible than weathered PVC.
          description: Algae and lichen growth on PVC manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from a thin, greenish
            film to thicker, crusty patches. The dominant colors are typically shades of green and brown, with coverage varying
            from sparse spots to extensive surface colonization. Lichen often presents as more textured and structurally complex
            than algae.
          distribution_patterns: Random, clustered, linear (following scratches or imperfections), edge-preferential, crevice-filling.
          edge_center_behavior: Algae often prefers edges and corners due to increased moisture retention. Lichen can colonize
            both edges and center, depending on species and microclimate.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners provide sheltered microclimates, promoting initial colonization. Grooves and
            scratches act as channels for water flow, leading to linear growth patterns.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of water carries algae spores and nutrients, resulting in vertical streaking. Pooling
            occurs in horizontal depressions, leading to localized concentrations.
          lighting_effects: 'Algae: Initially glossy when wet, becoming matte when dry. Lichen: Generally matte, with slight
            sheen on apothecia in certain lighting conditions.'
          texture_details: 'Algae: Initially smooth and slimy, becoming rougher and sometimes powdery as it dries. Lichen:
            Crusty, granular, or foliose (leaf-like), depending on the species. Apothecia (fruiting bodies) are often raised
            and have a smooth, disc-like texture.'
          thickness_range: 'Algae: 1-50 micrometers (fresh film), up to 200 micrometers (dried crust). Lichen: 100 micrometers
            - 5 millimeters (thallus), apothecia can be up to 1 millimeter thick.'
          typical_formations: 'Algae: Thin films, drip marks, pools in depressions, powdery crusts. Lichen: Crusts, patches,
            foliose structures, raised apothecia.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform thin films of algae in consistently moist
            areas to highly localized and patchy lichen growth.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_materials:
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh oxidation (hours/days) is often a thin, almost invisible film that slightly dulls the aluminum's
            shine. Aged oxidation (months/years) becomes thicker, more opaque, and often develops a chalky or powdery texture.
            Color can shift from white to gray or tan due to the incorporation of environmental pollutants. The surface may
            exhibit pitting or localized corrosion.
          buildup_progression: Oxidation starts as a thin, transparent film that forms almost immediately upon exposure to
            air. Over hours/days, this film thickens slightly, causing a dulling of the aluminum's shine. Over weeks/months,
            the oxidation layer becomes more visible, developing a white or gray color and a chalky texture. The buildup often
            starts at edges and scratches, then spreads inward. In polluted environments, the oxidation layer may incorporate
            contaminants, leading to discoloration and accelerated corrosion. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations
            in humidity and temperature.
          color_variations: '1. Freshly formed: Translucent or very light gray, almost imperceptible. 2. Light oxidation:
            Matte white or slightly off-white (eggshell). 3. Moderate oxidation: Dull gray with hints of yellow or brown discoloration
            in polluted environments. 4. Heavy oxidation: Chalky white to light tan, sometimes with darker gray or black spots
            due to localized corrosion or embedded contaminants. 5. Anodized (controlled oxidation): Can range from clear/silver
            to bronze, black, or other colors depending on the dye used during the anodization process.'
          common_patterns: Oxidation often starts at edges, scratches, or areas of surface imperfection. It can form a uniform
            coating, localized spots (especially around chloride deposits), streaks from water runoff, or accumulate in crevices
            and corners. The distribution is heavily influenced by environmental exposure and surface preparation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier oxidation due
            to increased exposure. Top surfaces exposed to rain or condensation may exhibit more oxidation than sheltered
            undersides. Crevices and areas around fasteners often accumulate oxidation products. Vertical walls may show streaks
            from water runoff, while horizontal surfaces may accumulate dust and debris that accelerate corrosion.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. The aluminum
            retains most of its original metallic shine. Thickness: nanometers. 2. Light (10-30%): Patchy coverage with a
            dull, slightly whitish appearance. The underlying aluminum is still visible. Thickness: <1 micrometer. 3. Moderate
            (30-60%): Significant dulling of the surface with a noticeable white or gray coating. The aluminum''s original
            shine is largely obscured. Thickness: 1-5 micrometers. 4. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick,
            chalky white or gray layer. The aluminum''s original appearance is barely visible. Thickness: 5-20 micrometers.
            5. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement in a thick, crusty layer of oxidation products. The underlying aluminum
            is completely obscured. Thickness: >20 micrometers.'
          description: Aluminum oxidation on aluminum surfaces manifests as a dull, often whitish or grayish layer that obscures
            the underlying metallic shine. The texture can range from smooth to rough depending on the oxidation process and
            environmental factors, and the coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating (thin, passivating layer). 2. Edge
            accumulation (due to increased exposure and stress). 3. Point source spreading (from localized corrosion sites).
            4. Gradient from source (decreasing oxidation intensity with distance from a corrosive agent). 5. Patchy/spotty
            (uneven exposure or surface contamination). 6. Streaky/linear (water runoff or directional exposure). 7. Localized
            concentrations (around fasteners or welds).'
          edge_center_behavior: Aluminum oxidation preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased exposure to environmental
            factors and higher stress concentrations. Edges are more susceptible to mechanical damage, which can disrupt the
            protective oxide layer and accelerate corrosion. The center areas tend to oxidize more slowly unless there are
            localized contaminants or surface imperfections.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oxidation accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture retention and reduced airflow. Flat areas may exhibit more uniform oxidation, while vertical surfaces
            show drip marks. Edges are prone to increased oxidation due to higher stress and exposure. Depressions and pits
            act as collection points for corrosive agents.
          gravity_influence: Gravity affects the distribution by causing downward flow of water and corrosive solutions, leading
            to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust and debris,
            accelerating corrosion. Runs down slopes create streaky patterns. Oxidation products can hang from overhead surfaces
            in the form of loose flakes or crusts.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oxidation may exhibit a slight sheen, while aged oxidation typically
            has a matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the dullness and color variations of the oxidized
            surface. Anodized surfaces can exhibit a metallic luster or a slight iridescence depending on the coating thickness
            and viewing angle.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and almost imperceptible for very thin layers to rough, powdery,
            or even slightly crystalline for thicker deposits. Fresh oxidation can feel slightly chalky. Aged oxidation can
            be crusty and easily flakes off. Anodized surfaces are typically smooth and hard.
          thickness_range: The thickness of aluminum oxidation can range from a few nanometers (native oxide layer) to several
            micrometers (naturally occurring oxidation) to millimeters (severe corrosion). Anodized layers are typically 5-25
            micrometers thick. Heavy corrosion buildup can reach thicknesses of 1-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (initial oxidation layer). 2. Thick crusts (advanced
            corrosion). 3. Discrete patches (localized corrosion sites). 4. Spots/dots (chloride-induced pitting). 5. Stains
            (discoloration from environmental contaminants). 6. Uniform coatings (anodized layers). 7. Buildups (around fasteners
            or welds). 8. Drip marks (vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The uniformity of oxidation varies greatly. A freshly formed native oxide layer is mostly
            uniform. Natural oxidation tends to be moderately patchy, influenced by surface imperfections and environmental
            factors. Anodized layers are designed to be perfectly uniform. Severe corrosion is highly variable/irregular,
            concentrated in specific areas.

          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often a thin, easily wiped-off film with a light color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more difficult to remove. The texture becomes rougher,
            and the stain may penetrate deeper into the ABS. Cracking and crazing of the ABS surface may also occur.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) that gradually thickens over time (days/weeks).
            It often begins at contact points (e.g., drips) and then spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and
            then move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations (e.g., humidity) can affect
            the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh stains often appear as a pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#D2B48C). As they age and react
            with the ABS, they can turn to a rust-orange (#A0522D) or dark brown (#8B4513). In severe cases of acid etching,
            a chalky white residue (#F5F5F5) may be present due to polymer degradation.
          common_patterns: The distribution pattern depends on the source of the contamination. Spills or drips create streaks
            and runs. Immersion or spraying can result in a more uniform coating. Accumulation often occurs in crevices and
            around edges. Point sources can create radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have lighter concentrations due to runoff, while bottom surfaces may have heavier
            concentrations due to pooling. Exposed areas are often more heavily contaminated than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, barely visible film, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): distinct staining, visible film or light
            crust, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): significant discoloration, thick crust or buildup, thickness 25-100
            μm. Extreme (>85%): complete coverage, very thick crust or severe etching, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on ABS typically manifest as discoloration and surface texture changes.
            The color ranges from light yellow to dark brown, depending on the contaminant and exposure time. The texture
            can vary from a slight dulling of the surface to significant pitting and roughening.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (from spraying or immersion), edge
            accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading (from a single drop), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven contamination), streaky/linear (from drips or runs), localized
            concentrations (in crevices). Edge accumulation and streaky/linear patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges and in crevices due to
            surface tension and capillary action. The contaminant is drawn to these areas, leading to higher concentrations.
            Uniform distribution is less common unless the entire surface is exposed equally.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. They pool on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Contaminants
            collect at edges due to surface tension. They may follow contours and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is common, resulting
            in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is typical. Contaminants settle
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is less common but possible with
            viscous contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained areas may appear more pronounced due to increased contrast. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can make the stains appear more muted. Acid-etched areas may exhibit a matte finish due to
            surface roughening. Some stains may exhibit a slight sheen if they contain oily residues.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and slightly tacky to rough and pitted. Light staining may only
            result in a slight dulling of the ABS surface. Heavier contamination can create a powdery or crusty texture. Acid
            etching can produce visible pitting and a rough, uneven surface. The surface can also become sticky due to plasticizer
            leaching.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain layer can range from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light film to
            several millimeters (0.1-2 mm) for heavy buildup. Acid etching can remove material to a depth of 10-500 μm, depending
            on the acid concentration and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled streaks), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (from dried residues), discrete patches
            (localized spills), spots/dots (splatters), stains (penetrated discoloration), uniform coatings (immersion), buildups
            (at edges/crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare unless the ABS part was fully immersed in the contaminant. Variations are
            caused by uneven application, gravity, and surface geometry.
        acrylic (pmma):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination may appear as a thin, almost invisible film. Over time, the stain can darken,
            thicken, and become more pronounced. Etching becomes more aggressive, leading to increased surface roughness and
            clouding. Aged stains are often more difficult to remove and may cause permanent damage to the acrylic surface.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours. It then thickens over days as more contaminant
            accumulates. Begins at contact points and spreads outward. Starts at edges and moves inward due to capillary action.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect
            the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh stains can exhibit a slight yellow tint (#FFFACD) or a faint iridescent sheen. As the stain
            ages or etching progresses, colors can shift to a light amber (#F0D58D), a milky white (due to surface roughening),
            or, in the presence of metal ions, a rust-orange (#B7410E) or greenish-blue (copper compounds). In severe cases,
            a dark brown (#8B4513) discoloration can occur due to polymer degradation.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping, and overall surface clouding. Acid
            etching tends to create a more uniform matte finish, while chemical stains often accumulate at edges, in crevices,
            or around points of contact. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Top surfaces may have more accumulation due to settling of airborne contaminants. Vertical walls exhibit
            drip marks with higher concentration at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces can have pooling. Exposed areas may experience
            more etching due to increased contact with the contaminant.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible, <1 μm thick. Light
            (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration, thin film, 1-5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, patchy
            coverage, 5-20 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration, thick film or crust, 20-100 μm thick. Extreme
            (>85%): Almost complete coverage, heavy buildup, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on acrylic (PMMA) typically appear as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color varies depending on the contaminant, ranging from subtle yellowing to distinct colorations and surface
            clouding. Etching creates a matte or frosted appearance, often with visible patterns related to the contaminant's
            flow or contact.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually from immersion).
            2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (from a single drop). 4) Streaky/linear
            (from dripping or wiping). 5) Patchy/spotty (from uneven contact). 6) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The liquid contaminant tends to wick along the edges, creating a higher concentration. Center
            areas may be less affected, especially with localized contamination. Uniform distribution is rare unless the entire
            surface is immersed.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act as collection
            points. Contours guide flow patterns. Depressions fill with liquid contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop
            down slopes. Hanging droplets form from overhead surfaces. The angle of the surface dictates the flow rate and
            accumulation patterns.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained or etched acrylic can exhibit a hazy or cloudy appearance. The
            surface may appear matte or slightly reflective, depending on the degree of etching. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight subtle color variations and surface imperfections. Heavily etched surfaces scatter light, creating
            a diffuse, non-glossy appearance.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with slight discoloration to noticeably rough and etched. Light
            staining may feel smooth to the touch, while heavier etching creates a matte, slightly abrasive surface. Acid
            etching can produce a fine, granular texture, while some chemical stains may leave a powdery or slightly sticky
            residue.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain or etched layer varies significantly. Thin films can be less than 1
            μm thick, while heavy buildup can reach 50-200 μm. Acid etching typically removes a layer of acrylic ranging from
            5-50 μm, depending on the acid concentration and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks). 2) Runs/streaks (from liquid
            flow). 3) Pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces). 4) Thin films (initial contamination). 5) Thick crusts (from
            repeated exposure and drying). 6) Discrete patches (from localized contact). 7) Stains (discoloration without
            significant buildup).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor
            variations is possible with immersion. Moderately patchy is common with spills or splashes. Highly variable/irregular
            is typical with localized contamination. The uniformity depends on the method of contamination and the surface
            properties of the acrylic.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin film or subtle discoloration. Aged contamination
            (months/years) tends to be thicker, darker, and more firmly adhered. Oxidation products darken over time. Salt
            deposits can become more crystalline and harder to remove. Acid-etched surfaces may become more porous and prone
            to further contamination.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens with continued
            exposure (days). Begins at contact points (e.g., droplet impact) then spreads outward (days). Starts at edges
            then moves inward due to capillary action (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with constant exposure
            (weeks/months). Point sources expand outward creating radial patterns (weeks/months). Layering effects occur with
            repeated contamination events (months/years). Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate
            of buildup (annual cycles).'
          color_variations: 'The color range is broad. Fresh stains from metal ions can appear as iridescent films (thin-film
            interference effects). Oxidation products often result in shades of brown: #A0522D (sienna), #8B4513 (saddle brown),
            #D2691E (chocolate). Salt deposits can appear as a dull white (#F5F5DC - beige) or light gray (#D3D3D3). Acid
            etching can leave a matte, whitened surface (#FAFAFA - snow).'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the source of contamination. Acid etching tends to be more uniform
            if the alumina is immersed, or localized if sprayed. Salt deposits often accumulate at edges and crevices due
            to evaporation. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Point source contamination leads to radial
            spreading.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and evaporation.
            Top surfaces exposed to airborne contaminants often have higher concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
            Crevices and pores act as collection points. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks with higher concentration at the
            bottom. Flat horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust and debris. Exposed areas receive more direct contamination
            than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, barely visible film, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            patchy discoloration, thin film visible at certain angles, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable discoloration,
            visible film or deposit, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): significant discoloration, thick film or deposit,
            thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): nearly complete coverage, thick crust or buildup, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on alumina surfaces manifest as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color varies depending on the contaminant, ranging from subtle off-white to dark brown or even iridescent
            hues. The texture can range from smooth to powdery or crusty, depending on the nature and concentration of the
            contaminant.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, typically from immersion),
            edge accumulation (common for evaporating liquids), point source spreading (from a single droplet), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application), streaky/linear (from dripping
            or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), radial patterns (from splatters). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and evaporation. Liquids tend to wick towards edges. Evaporation concentrates contaminants at the perimeter. Surface
            tension effects are stronger at edges. Center areas are often less contaminated unless the entire surface is flooded.
            This edge preference is a common observation.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners due to
            surface tension. Buildup occurs in crevices, providing sheltered areas. Liquids pool on flat areas due to gravity.
            Drips form on vertical surfaces. Contaminants collect at edges due to evaporation. Liquids follow contours due
            to surface tension. Liquids can bridge gaps between surfaces. Depressions fill with contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges of vertical surfaces. Drip marks extend from top to bottom. Vertical streaking
            is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Liquids run down slopes. Contaminants can hang from overhead
            surfaces as stalactite-like formations (rare on alumina, more common on porous materials).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, iridescent films are more pronounced. Matte surfaces created by acid etching
            appear dull and diffuse. Crystalline salt deposits can sparkle. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to wash out
            subtle color variations. Glossy films from metal ions reflect light, while powdery deposits scatter it.
          texture_details: The texture varies greatly. Light acid etching can leave a smooth, matte finish. Heavier etching
            creates a rough, porous surface. Salt deposits often form a crystalline or powdery texture, easily removed by
            wiping. Metal ion complexes can create a smooth, almost oily film. Organic residues can be sticky or gummy.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (thin-film interference) to several millimeters (heavy buildup
            of salt deposits or corrosion products). Acid-etched layers can range from 1 μm (slight etching) to 100 μm (significant
            material removal). Salt deposits can build up to 0.1-5 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (salt deposits), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatters), stains (penetrated contaminants), uniform coatings (immersion),
            buildups (repeated exposure), crystalline structures (salt deposits). Drip marks, thin films, and discrete patches
            are common.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations can occur with immersion in a contaminant. Moderately patchy distribution is common with
            spraying or uneven application. Highly variable/irregular distribution is typical for accidental spills or atmospheric
            deposition. Concentration is often concentrated in specific areas like crevices or edges. The uniformity level
            depends on the application method and surface properties of the alumina.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) typically appears as a subtle discoloration or a thin, easily
            removable film. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more deeply ingrained, with thicker, harder-to-remove
            deposits. Color darkens over time, and the surface becomes increasingly rough and pitted. The formation of aluminum
            oxide layers can further alter the visual appearance, creating a matte, whitish surface.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) that gradually thickens (days). Corrosion often
            begins at contact points (e.g., fasteners) and spreads outward. Edges are often the first areas affected, with
            corrosion then moving inward. Uniform gradual accumulation can occur in controlled environments. Point sources
            expand outward over time. Layering effects can be observed with repeated exposure to contaminants. Seasonal variations
            in humidity and temperature can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh etching may exhibit a slight iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference. Initial staining
            often presents as a light grey (#D3D3D3) or a dull, matte white. As corrosion progresses, colors shift to yellow-brown
            (#A0785A) and eventually dark brown or black (#301E1E) in heavily affected areas. Some stains may exhibit a greenish
            tint due to copper contamination (e.g., from brass fittings) resulting in a color close to #8FBC8F.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from fluid runoff, and overall dulling of the
            surface. Etching often initiates at scratches, edges, and areas with pre-existing surface defects. In immersion
            scenarios, a more uniform, albeit uneven, etching pattern is observed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to capillary action and increased
            exposure. Crevices and joints also accumulate higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit downward gradients
            due to gravity. Horizontal surfaces may accumulate more contaminants due to settling. Exposed areas generally
            experience higher etching rates than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible to the naked eye,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration with scattered spots and streaks, thickness 1-10 μm.
            Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration with interconnected patches and streaks, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy
            (60-85%): Extensive surface alteration with deep pitting and thick deposits, thickness 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Nearly complete surface coverage with severe corrosion and thick, crusty deposits, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on aluminum manifest as discoloration and surface roughening. The
            color ranges from subtle iridescent sheens to pronounced pitting with dark, matte residues. Coverage varies from
            localized spots to extensive surface alterations, often following pre-existing surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (immersion etching), edge accumulation
            (due to capillary action and higher exposure), point source spreading (from localized contamination), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven surface reactivity), streaky/linear
            (fluid runoff), localized concentrations (crevices and joints). Patchy and streaky patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action,
            higher exposure to the environment, and potential galvanic corrosion effects. The perimeter of a component often
            shows a higher concentration of corrosion products compared to the center. Uniform distribution is rare unless
            the entire surface is immersed in the etchant.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling of liquids. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges provide
            preferential sites for corrosion initiation. Depressions and scratches trap contaminants, accelerating etching
            in those areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling
            of particulate contaminants occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Contaminants may hang from
            overhead surfaces as stalactite-like formations in severe cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched aluminum may exhibit a dull, matte finish. Heavily corroded areas
            absorb light, appearing darker. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the surface may appear more uniform, but subtle
            color variations become more apparent. Iridescence may be visible under specific lighting angles in lightly etched
            areas.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with slight discoloration to rough and pitted. Light etching may
            feel slightly chalky. Heavier etching results in a noticeably rough surface with sharp edges around pits. Depending
            on the etchant, a powdery residue may be present. In some cases, a sticky or gummy residue may form, particularly
            with organic contaminants.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the altered layer varies significantly. Thin-film interference effects occur at
            thicknesses of 50-500 nanometers. Light etching may remove only a few micrometers (1-5 μm) of material. Heavy
            etching can remove tens to hundreds of micrometers (50-200 μm), creating visible pits and surface irregularities.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial stages), thick crusts (heavy contamination), discrete
            patches (localized corrosion), spots/dots (pinpoint corrosion), stains (discoloration without significant material
            removal), uniform coatings (immersion), buildups (edges and corners), crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform etching is rare outside of controlled laboratory
            conditions. Mostly uniform etching with minor variations can occur in immersion processes. Moderately patchy etching
            is common in industrial settings. Highly variable/irregular etching is typical with localized contamination. The
            uniformity level is primarily determined by the homogeneity of the etchant and the surface condition of the aluminum.
        aluminum nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a subtle discoloration or a thin, powdery film. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes more pronounced, with thicker deposits, darker colors, and potentially the
            formation of crusty or crystalline structures. The surface roughness also increases over time due to continued
            reaction with the environment.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film thickens
            and discoloration becomes more pronounced. After weeks, localized spots and patches begin to form. Over months,
            crusty deposits may develop, especially at edges and corners. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature
            can accelerate the buildup process.
          color_variations: Fresh etching often results in a matte, off-white appearance (#F8F8FF) due to surface roughening.
            As oxidation occurs, colors shift to pale yellow (#FFFFE0), then to light tan (#F5F5DC), and eventually to a rust-orange
            (#A0522D) with prolonged exposure and iron contamination. In severe cases, dark brown (#8B4513) or even black
            deposits can form.
          common_patterns: Etching patterns are often non-uniform. They can appear as localized spots or patches, streaks
            following the direction of etchant flow, or a general discoloration across the entire surface. Accumulation is
            common at edges, corners, and areas with pre-existing surface defects or scratches.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to capillary action and accumulation
            of contaminants. Crevices and surface defects also act as collection points. Vertical surfaces may exhibit a gradient
            from top to bottom due to gravity-driven flow of the etchant. Exposed areas generally have higher contamination
            levels than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Patchy
            discoloration with a thin film, typically <5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): More widespread discoloration with a
            thicker film, 5-25 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration with crusty deposits, 25-50 μm thick. Extreme
            (>85%): Almost complete coverage with thick, hardened deposits, >50 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) typically manifest as discoloration and
            surface roughening. The color ranges from subtle off-white to yellow-brown, depending on the etchant and contaminants.
            Coverage can be localized or widespread, often following grain boundaries or surface defects.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Patchy/spotty: Localized areas of discoloration.
            2) Edge accumulation: Higher concentration of contaminants at the edges of the AlN substrate. 3) Point source
            spreading: Contamination originating from a specific point and spreading outwards. 4) Gradient from source: Concentration
            decreasing with distance from the contamination source. 5) Streaky/linear: Following the direction of etchant
            flow or surface scratches.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to increased surface
            energy and exposure to the etchant. Capillary action also draws contaminants towards the edges. The center areas
            may exhibit a lower concentration, especially if the etchant is applied from the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas may exhibit pooling of the etchant. Vertical surfaces show drip marks. Edges
            tend to have higher concentrations due to increased exposure and surface energy.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is common,
            leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is also observed. Settling
            on horizontal surfaces results in a more uniform distribution compared to vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched AlN surfaces tend to appear matte due to the increased surface roughness,
            scattering light in all directions. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the color variations and surface
            irregularities. Depending on the composition of the contaminants, some areas may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence,
            especially if thin films of metal oxides are present.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth (before etching) to rough and porous after etching. Acid etching
            creates a micro-roughened surface, often with visible grain boundaries and etch pits. Depending on the etchant
            and concentration, the surface can feel powdery or slightly sticky due to residual reaction products. Crystalline
            structures may be visible under magnification if salt deposits are present.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the contamination layer varies significantly. Initially, it can be a thin film,
            on the order of 0.1-1 μm. With prolonged exposure and buildup, it can reach 10-100 μm, or even thicker in extreme
            cases where crusty deposits form.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: A uniform layer of discoloration. 2) Thick crusts:
            Hardened deposits of reaction products. 3) Discrete patches: Localized areas of contamination. 4) Spots/dots:
            Small, isolated points of discoloration. 5) Stains: Discoloration that penetrates the surface. 6) Drip marks:
            Vertical streaks caused by the flow of etchant.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. This is due to variations
            in surface reactivity, etchant concentration, and the presence of pre-existing defects. Perfectly uniform distribution
            is rare unless the etching process is carefully controlled and the AlN surface is pristine.
        boron carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often a thin, barely visible film with light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more textured. Color deepens, and the surface becomes
            noticeably rougher. Cracking and flaking of the buildup may occur.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (droplets) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with repeated
            contamination events. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh stains can appear as a pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#D2B48C). As the contamination
            ages and oxidation occurs, colors shift to rust-orange (#B7410E), dark brown (#8B4513), and even black (#000000)
            in severe cases. Some metal ion complexes can impart greenish or bluish hues.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from liquid runoff, and uniform coatings in areas
            exposed to consistent contamination. Accumulation often occurs at edges and in crevices due to capillary action
            and gravity. Acid etching can create a frosted or matte appearance across the entire surface.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier concentrations
            due to capillary action and pooling. Top surfaces may have lighter concentrations due to runoff. Crevices accumulate
            contaminants. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled particles. Exposed areas
            experience more direct contamination than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible discoloration, <1 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): slight
            discoloration, thin film, 1-5 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable discoloration, patchy coverage, 5-20
            μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): significant discoloration, near-complete coverage, 20-50 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%):
            complete coverage, thick buildup, >50 μm thickness.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on Boron Carbide typically manifest as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color varies depending on the contaminant, ranging from light yellow to dark brown, often with a matte finish.
            Coverage can be localized or widespread, depending on the exposure conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (immersion), edge accumulation (capillary
            action), point source spreading (droplet), gradient from source (spray), patchy/spotty (uneven exposure), streaky/linear
            (runoff), localized concentrations (crevices). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and higher surface energy. The center areas may experience etching but less buildup of visible contaminants. Uniform
            distribution is rare unless the entire surface is immersed.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners due to
            surface tension. Buildup occurs in crevices due to trapping. Liquids pool on flat areas. Drips form on vertical
            surfaces. Contaminants collect at edges due to capillary action. Contours guide flow patterns. Depressions fill
            with contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible with viscous contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may exhibit a slight sheen. Aged contamination typically has
            a matte finish due to surface roughening. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with certain thin-film
            interferences from specific contaminants.
          texture_details: The texture varies. Fresh contamination may feel smooth or slightly sticky. As the reaction progresses,
            the surface becomes rougher due to etching and formation of reaction products. Aged contamination can be powdery,
            crusty, or even crystalline depending on the specific contaminants and reaction products. Grain size is typically
            sub-micrometer to micrometer scale.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of <1 μm for initial contamination to a heavy buildup of 10-100
            μm or more for aged contamination. Etching depth can range from nanometers to several micrometers depending on
            acid concentration and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (droplets), stains (diffusion into surface), uniform coatings (immersion),
            buildups (repeated exposure), crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution occurs
            with immersion or vapor deposition. Moderately patchy distribution is common with spray or droplet contamination.
            Highly variable/irregular distribution occurs with localized spills or uneven exposure. Uniformity is affected
            by surface roughness, wettability, and contaminant delivery method.
        boron nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) typically presents as a thin, light-colored film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more textured. Oxidation products may become more crystalline, and
            organic residues can harden and darken.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible under controlled
            conditions. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations in
            humidity and temperature can influence the rate of buildup (months).
          color_variations:
          - 'Initial Stage: Pale Yellow (#F0E68C) to Light Tan (#D2B48C) - indicative of early oxidation or salt deposition.'
          - 'Moderate Contamination: Rust-Orange (#B7410E) with Brown (#A52A2A) edges - suggests iron oxide formation.'
          - 'Heavy Contamination: Dark Brown (#654321) to Black (#000000) - indicates significant buildup of organic residues
            or advanced oxidation.'
          - 'Acid Etching: Whitish-Gray (#D3D3D3) with a frosted appearance - caused by surface roughening.'
          - 'Salt Deposits: Crystalline White (#FFFFFF) - visible as distinct particles or a thin film.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns vary. Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks.
            Over time, it can spread to form a more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces. Edges and crevices
            tend to accumulate more contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and evaporation.
            Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and airborne contaminants. Crevices and surface defects act as collection
            points. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces accumulate more uniform layers.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Almost complete coverage, very thick buildup, may obscure surface features.
              thickness: '>100 μm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Significant discoloration, thick buildup, difficult to clean.
              thickness: 20-100 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Scattered patches, slight discoloration, easily wiped off.
              thickness: 1-5 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Noticeable discoloration, patchy coverage, requires cleaning.
              thickness: 5-20 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on Boron Nitride surfaces manifest as discoloration and surface texture
            changes. The color varies depending on the contaminant, ranging from pale yellow to dark brown, often with a matte
            finish. Coverage can be localized or widespread, depending on the exposure conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to capillary action and evaporation), Point
            source spreading (from a droplet or spill), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), Patchy/spotty
            (uneven deposition), Streaky/linear (from fluid flow), Localized concentrations (in crevices or surface defects).
            Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action,
            evaporation, and surface tension effects. The center areas may exhibit less contamination, especially on flat
            surfaces. Uniform distribution is rare. The perimeter often shows a higher concentration of contaminants.
          geometry_effects: Contamination accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow.
            Flat areas allow for pooling and uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points. Surface defects and scratches trap contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust and debris. Runs down
            slopes are observed. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations (rare).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stains may exhibit a slight sheen if oily residues are present. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations. Acid-etched surfaces appear matte and diffuse light.
            Salt deposits can sparkle under bright light.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth to rough depending on the severity of the contamination. Light stains
            may feel slightly gritty. Heavy buildup can create a crusty or powdery surface. Acid etching results in a matte,
            roughened surface, often with microscopic pitting.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a thin film (0.1-1 μm) for initial stains to a heavy buildup (10-500 μm)
            for aged contamination. Acid etching removes material, creating surface roughness on the order of 1-10 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            Pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged contamination),
            Discrete patches (localized spills), Spots/dots (individual particles), Stains (discoloration of the surface),
            Uniform coatings (rare, usually from controlled deposition), Buildups (at edges and corners), Crystalline structures
            (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity ranges from moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the method of contamination, surface preparation, and
            environmental conditions. Uneven airflow or temperature gradients can cause patchy deposition.
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) typically presents as a subtle discoloration or a thin film. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes more pronounced, with deeper color changes, thicker buildup, and potentially
            the formation of corrosion products like verdigris. The surface roughness increases over time as etching progresses.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours. Over days, discoloration becomes more
            apparent and localized spots begin to form. After weeks, the stain thickens and spreads, potentially forming corrosion
            products. Months of exposure can lead to significant material loss and the formation of thick crusts or deep pits.
            Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can accelerate the process.
          color_variations: 'Fresh stains may appear as a light golden-brown (#B8860B) or a slight reddish hue (#A7754B).
            As the stain ages or etching progresses, colors shift towards darker browns (#8B4513), rust-orange (#B7410E),
            and even greenish-blue due to copper oxidation (verdigris, approximately #40826D). In severe cases, black copper
            oxide (#000000) can form.'
          common_patterns: Stains and etching often appear as localized spots, irregular patches, or streaks. Acid etching
            tends to follow grain boundaries in the brass, creating a network of fine lines. Drip marks and runs are common
            on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is often observed at edges, crevices, and areas where liquids can pool.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where liquids can accumulate.
            Top surfaces exposed to airborne contaminants may have a more uniform but lighter coating than sheltered areas.
            Vertical walls often exhibit drip marks and streaks, with higher concentrations at the bottom. Corners and sharp
            edges are prone to increased buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Scattered
            patches of discoloration, with a thickness of 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration with some surface
            roughness, thickness of 10-30 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration and surface damage, thickness of 30-100
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Extensive corrosion and material loss, thickness exceeding 100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on brass manifest as a range of discoloration and surface texture
            changes. Colors vary from subtle tarnishes to pronounced corrosion products, often appearing as localized spots
            or irregular patterns. The surface can range from smooth with a slight haze to rough and pitted, depending on
            the severity and type of chemical exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized spots (from droplets), edge accumulation
            (due to capillary action), point source spreading (from a single point of contamination), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven coverage), streaky/linear (from liquid flow),
            and localized concentrations (in crevices or pits).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and increased exposure to environmental factors. The center areas may exhibit a more uniform but lighter coating,
            especially if the contamination source is airborne. Crevices and corners also show high accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges
            act as collection points. Depressions fill with liquid. Sharp edges are more susceptible to corrosion due to increased
            surface energy.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquids, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces experience
            settling of airborne particles and pooling of liquids.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As the surface becomes
            rougher due to etching, the finish becomes more matte. Verdigris can exhibit a dull, slightly iridescent appearance.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the color variations and surface irregularities.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with a thin, barely perceptible film to rough and pitted. Light
            etching may feel slightly rough to the touch, while severe etching can create deep pits and a coarse, uneven surface.
            Crystalline deposits of salts may form a powdery or crusty texture. Organic residues can leave a sticky or oily
            feel.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain or etched layer varies significantly. Thin films can be as thin as 1-5
            μm. Moderate buildup can range from 10-50 μm. Heavy corrosion or etching can result in material loss of 100 μm
            or more, potentially reaching millimeters in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (from liquid runoff), runs/streaks (from liquid flow),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (from salt deposits), discrete
            patches (localized corrosion), spots/dots (droplet residues), stains (discoloration), and buildups (at edges or
            crevices). Crystalline structures may form from salt precipitation.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Non-uniformity arises from variations in surface finish, localized contamination sources, uneven liquid
            distribution, and differences in exposure to corrosive agents.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin film with subtle color changes. Aged contamination
            (months/years) can develop into thicker, more pronounced layers with darker colors and rougher textures. The formation
            of stable patinas can slow down further corrosion.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation can occur with consistent exposure.
            Point sources expand outward. Layering effects can be observed with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in humidity and temperature can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh stains may exhibit a light green-blue hue (#ADD8E6) due to copper oxidation. As the stain
            ages, it can transition to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) or a dark brown (#8B4513) due to the formation of copper
            oxides and sulfides. In severe cases, a blackish-green (#344830) patina can develop. Salt deposits can appear
            as white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#D3D3D3) crystalline formations.
          common_patterns: Stains often accumulate in localized spots, streaks, or drip marks. They tend to concentrate in
            crevices, edges, and areas where liquids can pool. Uniform coatings are less common, typically only occurring
            after immersion in a corrosive solution.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces where
            liquids can pool. Vertical walls may exhibit drip marks with higher concentrations at the bottom. Exposed areas
            are often more heavily stained than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): noticeable discoloration,
            thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): significant discoloration, patchy coverage, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            extensive discoloration, thick deposits, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): nearly complete coverage, very thick
            deposits, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on bronze manifest as a range of discoloration and surface texture
            changes. Colors vary from subtle patinas to more aggressive corrosion products, often appearing as localized spots
            or streaks. The texture can range from smooth to rough, depending on the severity and type of chemical exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: point source spreading (from a single drop), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (random distribution), streaky/linear (due
            to runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices), and edge accumulation. Patchy/spotty and edge accumulation
            are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges and in crevices. This
            is due to surface tension effects, capillary action, and the tendency for liquids to collect at boundaries. The
            center areas are often less affected unless the entire surface is submerged.
          geometry_effects: Stains accumulate in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced evaporation. Liquids
            pool on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Stains collect at edges due to surface tension effects. The
            geometry dictates the flow and accumulation of corrosive agents.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. The effect is more pronounced with
            liquid contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may exhibit a slight sheen. Aged stains tend to have a matte
            finish. Depending on the composition of the stain, iridescence or rainbow effects may be observed, particularly
            with thin films of oxidation products.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth to rough. Light etching may result in a slightly roughened surface,
            barely perceptible to the touch. More aggressive etching can create a pitted or granular texture. Salt deposits
            can form crystalline structures that feel rough and gritty. Organic residues may leave a sticky or oily feel.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for thin films to several millimeters (0.1-2 mm)
            for heavy buildup. Salt deposits can form crusts up to 5 mm thick in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled streaks), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (early stage), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches (localized
            spots), stains (discoloration), and buildups (accumulated deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface exposure, liquid flow patterns, and the
            presence of surface defects.
        cast iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) typically presents as a thin, light-colored film or localized
            spots. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more extensive. The color deepens from yellow-orange
            to red-brown or dark brown/black. The texture becomes rougher, and the buildup of oxidation products can create
            a crusty or flaky appearance. Pitting becomes more pronounced.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin film of oxidation products within hours
            of exposure. 2) Begins at contact points with the etchant and spreads outward. 3) Accumulation is often faster
            at edges and corners. 4) Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; localized corrosion is more common. 5) Point sources
            of corrosion expand outward over days and weeks. 6) Layering effects can occur with repeated exposure to the etchant.
            7) Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can influence the rate of corrosion, with higher rates during
            humid periods. The process can take months or years to reach severe levels.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh etching often reveals a matte gray (#808080) surface where the original mill scale has
            been removed. As oxidation progresses, colors shift towards: 1) Yellow-orange (Munsell 7.5YR 7/6, approx. #E9C2A6)
            for initial rust formation. 2) Red-brown (Munsell 2.5YR 4/8, approx. #B7410E) for more advanced oxidation. 3)
            Dark brown/black (Munsell 5YR 2/1, approx. #332D29) in areas with heavy oxidation or the presence of iron oxides
            like magnetite. 4) Greenish-blue (due to copper salts if copper is present in the etchant or alloy, approx. #ADD8E6)
            in localized areas.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns vary widely. Acid etching often starts at grain boundaries and imperfections
            in the cast iron, leading to localized pitting. Stains can form drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools on horizontal
            surfaces, and accumulate in crevices. Uniform etching is rare; localized corrosion is more common.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to capillary action and evaporation.
            Crevices and low-lying areas also accumulate higher concentrations of etchant and corrosion products. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit a concentration gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to runoff. Flat surfaces
            may have more uniform concentration, but pooling can lead to localized areas of higher concentration.
          coverage_ranges: '1) Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of rust or discoloration, typically a few micrometers
            thick. 2) Light (10-30%): Scattered patches of rust, thin film visible, 5-25 μm thick. 3) Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            rust coverage, surface texture noticeably altered, 25-100 μm thick. 4) Heavy (60-85%): Extensive rust coverage,
            thick crusts forming, 100-500 μm thick. 5) Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete rust coverage, significant material
            loss due to etching, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on cast iron manifest as a discoloration and surface alteration, ranging
            from subtle color changes to significant material removal. The appearance is highly variable depending on the
            etchant, exposure time, and the alloy composition of the cast iron, but generally involves rust-colored oxidation
            products and potentially a roughened surface texture. Coverage can range from localized spots to complete surface
            transformation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Localized pitting around grain boundaries. 2) Streaky
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to acid runoff. 3) Pooling in low-lying areas and crevices. 4) Gradient from
            the point of acid contact, with higher concentration near the source. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution due to variations
            in surface reactivity. 6) Edge accumulation due to capillary action and evaporation.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and increased exposure to the environment. The perimeter often exhibits a higher concentration of corrosion products
            compared to the center areas. This effect is particularly pronounced on flat surfaces and in areas with sharp
            corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Acid accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow for pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges
            provide nucleation sites for corrosion. Depressions fill with etchant and corrosion products. Contours influence
            the flow of acid and the distribution of corrosion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop
            down slopes. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets of etchant or corrosion products. The angle of the
            surface directly impacts the rate and direction of flow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched surfaces tend to appear matte due to the increased surface roughness.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the color variations and surface texture. Depending on the specific
            oxidation products, a slight sheen or iridescence may be observed in certain areas, particularly with thin films
            of iron oxides. The presence of moisture can enhance the sheen.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from slightly roughened to significantly pitted, depending on the severity of
            the etching. Light etching may feel only slightly abrasive, while heavy etching can create a noticeably rough,
            uneven surface. The surface can exhibit a powdery or granular feel due to loose oxidation products. In some cases,
            a crystalline structure may be visible under magnification, particularly with salt deposits.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for initial oxidation to several
            millimeters (1-5 mm) for heavy buildup of corrosion products. Etch depth can range from a few micrometers (5-20
            μm) for light etching to hundreds of micrometers (100-500 μm) or even millimeters for severe etching.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 2) Runs/streaks of discolored
            material. 3) Pools/puddles in low-lying areas. 4) Thin films of oxidation products. 5) Thick crusts of corrosion.
            6) Discrete patches of rust. 7) Spots/dots of localized corrosion. 8) Stains that penetrate the surface. 9) Buildups
            at edges and corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in the cast iron's microstructure, surface preparation, and the distribution of the
            etchant. The presence of inclusions, porosity, and variations in grain size contribute to non-uniform etching.
        chromium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often characterized by thin, iridescent films or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) typically exhibits thicker, more pronounced discoloration, often with visible
            rust or corrosion products. The texture becomes rougher, and the affected area expands. The color darkens and
            becomes more opaque.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points (e.g., a droplet) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature
            can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often presents as iridescent sheens with colors like light blue (#ADD8E6)
            or pale yellow (#FFFFE0) due to thin-film interference. As oxidation progresses, colors shift to yellow-brown
            (#A0785A), rust-orange (#B7410E), and eventually dark brown or black (#000000) in heavily corroded areas. The
            specific color depends on the contaminant and the oxidation state of the chromium.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping liquids, and accumulation in crevices
            and along edges. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform discoloration, while vertical surfaces often show drip
            marks. The initial point of contact for the contaminant often becomes the most heavily affected area.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            evaporation. Top surfaces may have higher concentrations of airborne contaminants. Corners and low points tend
            to accumulate liquids. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping. Exposed areas may
            experience more rapid oxidation than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, typically a few micrometers thick.
            Light (10-30%): Scattered patches of discoloration, thin film with some visible texture, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate
            (30-60%): Significant discoloration with visible corrosion products, uneven texture, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%):
            Extensive corrosion with thick buildup, rough texture, 100-500 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete coverage
            with heavy corrosion, significant alteration of the original surface, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on chromium surfaces typically manifest as discoloration and surface
            roughening. The color ranges from subtle iridescent sheens to distinct rust-colored patches, often concentrated
            in areas where contaminants have pooled or reacted most aggressively. The texture can range from slightly altered
            smoothness to a visibly pitted or crystalline surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to capillary action and evaporation),
            point source spreading (from a single droplet), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven distribution of contaminants), streaky/linear (from dripping or flowing liquids), and localized
            concentrations (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and evaporation. The concentration of contaminants is often higher at the perimeter than in the center. This is
            particularly true for liquids that spread across the surface and then evaporate from the edges inward. The mechanism
            is driven by surface tension and evaporation rates.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Liquids pool on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Contaminants collect at
            edges due to evaporation. The effect is driven by surface tension and gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Liquids pool at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Contaminants settle on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur
            down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is less common but possible with viscous liquids.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit iridescence or a slight sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting may reveal subtle color variations that are not apparent in sunlight. Heavily corroded areas tend to
            have a matte finish, while areas with salt deposits may exhibit a slight crystalline sparkle.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Light etching may feel only slightly rougher than the original
            polished chromium. More severe etching creates a visibly pitted surface, potentially with a crystalline or powdery
            feel depending on the reaction products. Acid etching can leave a matte finish. Salt deposits can create a crusty
            texture.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the contamination layer ranges from a few nanometers (thin-film iridescence) to
            several millimeters (heavy corrosion buildup). Etched areas can have depths ranging from 1 μm to 100 μm or more,
            depending on the acid concentration and exposure time. Salt deposits can range from a few micrometers to several
            millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks from flowing liquids), runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks but less defined), pools/puddles (accumulation in low points), thin films (initial layer
            of contamination), thick crusts (buildup of corrosion products or salt deposits), discrete patches (localized
            areas of contamination), spots/dots (small, isolated areas of corrosion), stains (discoloration without significant
            buildup), and uniform coatings (rare, but possible under controlled conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations can occur on flat surfaces exposed to a consistent environment. Moderately patchy distribution
            is common due to uneven contaminant deposition. Highly variable/irregular distribution is typical in areas with
            complex geometry or varying exposure conditions. The uniformity level is primarily determined by the method of
            contamination and the surface geometry.
        cobalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more pronounced. Corrosion products build up, creating
            a rougher texture and potentially flaking or peeling. Color shifts from lighter shades to darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It can
            begin at contact points (e.g., welds, fasteners) then spreads outward. It may start at edges then move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources can expand outward, creating
            radial patterns. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination often presents as a thin iridescent film with colors like #778899 (LightSlateGray)
            or a slight bluish tint. As oxidation progresses, colors shift towards #A0522D (Sienna) or #B7410E (Rust). Aged
            stains can exhibit darker shades like #654321 (DarkKhaki) or even near-black (#000000) in heavily corroded areas.
            Acid etching can also produce a matte gray appearance (#808080) due to surface roughening.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns vary greatly. Acid etching tends to be more uniform, creating a matte or
            frosted appearance. Stains often appear as localized spots, streaks, or drip marks. Salt deposits tend to accumulate
            at edges and in crevices. Organic residues often leave a thin, uneven film across the surface.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            accumulation of contaminants. Top surfaces may have more dust and particulate matter. Vertical walls may exhibit
            drip marks. Horizontal surfaces may have more pooling. Exposed areas may experience more corrosion due to increased
            oxygen and moisture availability. Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust and debris.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, almost imperceptible film. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered spots, light discoloration, or a thin, uneven film. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, patchy
            coverage, or a thicker film. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, near-complete coverage, or a thick layer
            of corrosion products. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick crusts, and significant surface alteration.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on cobalt surfaces typically manifest as a discoloration ranging from
            subtle iridescent films to more pronounced, localized corrosion spots. The texture varies from smooth, almost
            imperceptible changes to rough, pitted surfaces depending on the severity and type of etchant. Coverage can range
            from sparse isolated spots to near-complete surface alteration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (acid etching), edge accumulation
            (salt deposits), point source spreading (localized corrosion), gradient from source (chemical spills), patchy/spotty
            (uneven contamination), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (crevices), and radial patterns
            (around a corrosion initiation point).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary
            action and increased exposure to environmental factors. Salt deposits are particularly prone to edge accumulation.
            Corrosion can also initiate at edges due to stress concentrations. Uniform distribution is more common with acid
            etching.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Buildup occurs in crevices due to reduced airflow and increased moisture retention. Pooling
            occurs on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Collection occurs at edges due to surface tension. Contours
            are followed by liquid contaminants. Gaps are bridged by corrosion products. Depressions are filled with debris.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs occur down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces (though less common on cobalt due to its typical
            applications).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, thin films can exhibit iridescence or a rainbow effect. Acid-etched surfaces
            tend to have a matte finish with little to no gloss. Corrosion products can appear dull and opaque. Under indoor
            fluorescent lighting, the colors may appear less vibrant and the texture less pronounced.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth (almost imperceptible to the touch) for thin film contamination
            to rough and pitted for heavily etched areas. Acid etching often creates a matte finish with microscopic irregularities.
            Salt deposits can feel crystalline or powdery. Organic residues may leave a slightly sticky or oily feel. Heavy
            corrosion can result in a crusty or flaky surface.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (iridescent films) to several millimeters (heavy corrosion
            buildup). Acid-etched layers are typically in the range of 1-10 μm. Salt deposits can range from 10 μm to 1 mm.
            Corrosion crusts can reach thicknesses of 0.1-5 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform contamination), thick crusts (heavy corrosion), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (initial corrosion sites), stains (discoloration), uniform coatings
            (acid etching), buildups (edge accumulation), and crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Acid etching tends to be mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Stains and corrosion are often moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Salt deposits are often concentrated
            in specific areas. The uniformity level depends on the type of contaminant, the exposure conditions, and the surface
            preparation.
        concrete:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a bright, distinct discoloration. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more diffuse, and may be partially obscured by dirt and weathering. The texture
            of aged stains can become more pronounced as the concrete surface erodes around them. Thickness can increase as
            more contaminant accumulates over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points, then spreads outwards. It may begin
            at edges and move inward, or start from point sources and expand outwards. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible
            but less common. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in rainfall
            and temperature can influence the rate of buildup. The timeframe can range from hours for initial discoloration
            to months/years for significant buildup and texture changes.
          color_variations: 'Fresh acid etching often presents a lighter, chalky appearance, close to #F5F5DC (Beige) or a
            pale yellow (#FFFFE0). Metal ion contamination can result in rust-orange (#B7410E) or reddish-brown (#A52A2A)
            stains. Organic dyes can introduce a wider range of colors, including greens, blues, and purples, but these are
            less common in industrial settings. Aged stains tend to darken and become more muted, shifting towards darker
            browns (#8B4513) or even black (#000000) due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots or patches where the contaminant was spilled or dripped,
            streaks running down vertical surfaces due to gravity, and overall discoloration of the concrete surface. Acid
            etching tends to be more uniform if the acid was applied evenly, but can also create irregular patterns if the
            application was uneven. Stains often accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to runoff and accumulation.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered areas. Crevices and low-lying areas
            tend to accumulate more contaminant. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely noticeable discoloration. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches and streaks, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, patches merging
            together. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration, most of the surface covered. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete
            coverage, thick crusts or coatings. Thickness increases with coverage, ranging from micrometers in sparse areas
            to millimeters in extreme cases.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on concrete manifest as discoloration and surface degradation. Colors
            range from subtle off-whites and yellows to vibrant oranges and browns, depending on the contaminant. The texture
            varies from slightly roughened to deeply pitted, with coverage ranging from localized spots to extensive coatings.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually from intentional application),
            edge accumulation (due to runoff and evaporation), point source spreading (from spills), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (from uneven application or localized contamination),
            streaky/linear (from drips or runs), localized concentrations (in cracks and crevices), and radial patterns (from
            splashes). Patchy/spotty and streaky/linear are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to runoff and
            evaporation. The perimeter of a spill will often have a higher concentration than the center. This is due to the
            liquid spreading outwards and then evaporating at the edges, leaving behind a higher concentration of the contaminant.
          geometry_effects: Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced evaporation.
            They pool on flat areas due to gravity. They drip on vertical surfaces due to gravity. They collect at edges due
            to runoff and evaporation. They follow contours due to surface tension. They bridge gaps and fill depressions
            due to capillary action and gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is common, leading
            to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common result of gravity.
            Settling on horizontal surfaces occurs due to gravity. Runs down slopes are also common. Hanging from overhead
            surfaces is less common but possible with viscous contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may appear brighter and more vibrant, while aged stains may
            appear duller and more muted. Acid-etched surfaces tend to have a matte finish, while some metal stains may exhibit
            a slight sheen due to the presence of metal oxides. Iridescence is rare but possible with certain metal contaminants
            under specific lighting conditions.
          texture_details: The texture can range from slightly roughened (like fine sandpaper) to deeply pitted and etched,
            depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. Acid etching creates a porous, friable surface. Metal
            stains often feel powdery or slightly crusty due to the formation of metal oxides and hydroxides. Salt deposits
            can form crystalline structures visible under magnification. Touch can reveal a gritty or sandy feel.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the contamination layer varies widely. Thin films can be as thin as 1-10 μm. Moderate
            buildup can range from 25-100 μm. Heavy crusts can reach thicknesses of 1-5 mm or more. Acid etching removes material,
            so there is no added thickness, but the depth of etching can range from a few micrometers to several millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation),
            discrete patches (from localized spills), spots/dots (from splashes or airborne contaminants), stains (general
            discoloration), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in crevices), and crystalline structures (from salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the contaminant was intentionally applied as a coating. The non-uniformity is caused
            by variations in surface porosity, uneven application, and the effects of gravity and weathering.
        copper:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, uniform film with a bright copper-orange color.
            Over time (months/years), the color darkens to brown or green due to oxidation and the formation of copper salts.
            The texture becomes rougher as the etching progresses, and the thickness of the stain increases.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: (1) Starts as a thin film of copper oxide (hours). (2) Localized
            etching begins at contact points (days). (3) Etching spreads outward from these points (weeks). (4) Edge accumulation
            becomes more pronounced (months). (5) Thickening of the stain occurs due to continued oxidation and deposition
            of copper salts (years). Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can accelerate the process.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Freshly etched: Salmon Pink (#FA8072) with iridescent sheen due to thin oxide layer (thickness < 100nm)'
          - 'Lightly stained: Copper-Orange (#DA8A67) with subtle darkening at grain boundaries.'
          - 'Moderately stained: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with localized dark brown (#8B4513) spots.'
          - 'Heavily stained: Dark Brown (#654321) with greenish-blue (#ADD8E6) deposits of copper salts in etched areas.'
          - 'Aged stain: Patina Green (#9BBB59) with dark brown (#4A3020) undertones, especially in sheltered areas.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the application method and etchant. Uniform coatings occur with
            immersion etching. Localized spots and streaks are common with spray etching or accidental spills. Drip marks
            are visible on vertical surfaces. Accumulation occurs at edges and crevices due to surface tension and capillary
            action.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies depending on the exposure conditions. Edges and crevices tend to
            have higher concentrations due to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to airborne contaminants
            may have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due
            to gravity.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Complete coverage with thick, layered deposits, significant surface alteration, thickness > 100
                μm.
              visual_appearance: Dark green (#006400) or black (#000000) with a heavily textured surface.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Extensive coverage with thick crusts or crystalline deposits, thickness 10-100 μm.
              visual_appearance: Dark brown (#654321) with greenish-blue (#ADD8E6) deposits and a rough texture.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Scattered patches and streaks, noticeable discoloration, thickness 0.1-1 μm.
              visual_appearance: Copper with a light orange-brown (#CD853F) haze and some darker spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Significant coverage with visible etching patterns, thickness 1-10 μm.
              visual_appearance: Predominantly orange-brown (#D2691E) with darker brown (#8B4513) etched areas.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration, thickness < 0.1 μm.
              visual_appearance: Mostly bare copper with a few scattered spots of light orange (#FFA07A).
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on copper result in a range of visual effects, from subtle discoloration
            to significant surface alteration. The color varies from light orange to dark brown or even greenish hues, depending
            on the etchant and reaction products. The texture can range from smooth to rough, with visible etching patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (immersion etching), edge accumulation
            (surface tension), point source spreading (droplets), gradient from source (spills), patchy/spotty (uneven application),
            streaky/linear (drip marks). Uniform coating is rare in uncontrolled environments. Edge accumulation and point
            source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The etchant tends to flow towards and concentrate at the edges. In some cases, the center
            may be etched more uniformly if the entire surface is immersed in the etchant. However, in most real-world scenarios,
            edge accumulation is dominant.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Accumulation occurs in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Pooling occurs on flat areas. Drips occur on vertical surfaces. Collection occurs at
            edges due to surface tension. Contours are followed by the etchant. Depressions fill with etchant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, freshly etched copper exhibits a metallic sheen. As the stain ages, the
            surface becomes more matte. Iridescence can be observed in thin films due to interference effects. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface texture.
          texture_details: The texture varies depending on the etchant and exposure time. Light etching results in a smooth,
            slightly matte surface. Moderate etching creates a rough, uneven texture with visible grain boundaries. Heavy
            etching can produce a pitted, crystalline surface. Touch can range from smooth to gritty, depending on the scale
            of the etching.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (nm) for initial oxidation to several micrometers (μm) for
            heavy etching. Light stains are typically < 1 μm thick. Moderate stains range from 1-10 μm. Heavy stains can exceed
            100 μm, forming a visible crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial oxidation), thick crusts (heavy etching), discrete patches
            (localized contamination), spots/dots (droplets), stains (absorption into the copper), uniform coatings (controlled
            etching), buildups (repeated exposure), crystalline structures (copper salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity ranges from perfectly uniform (rare, controlled etching) to highly variable/irregular
            (common, uncontrolled exposure). Uniformity is influenced by the application method, etchant concentration, and
            surface cleanliness. Uneven surfaces and contaminants promote patchy distributions.
        lead:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a subtle discoloration or a thin film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) typically exhibits a thicker buildup of corrosion products, more pronounced color changes (darker
            and more saturated), and a rougher, more textured surface. Pitting and localized corrosion become more evident
            over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film thickens
            and discoloration becomes more apparent. Contamination often begins at contact points with other materials or
            at areas of pre-existing surface defects, then spreads outward. Edges are often the first areas to show visible
            corrosion. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible under controlled exposure conditions. Layering effects can
            occur with intermittent exposure to different contaminants. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can
            influence the rate of corrosion.
          color_variations: Freshly etched lead may exhibit a dull gray (#808080) or slightly whitish appearance due to the
            formation of lead salts. Over time, oxidation leads to colors ranging from a light yellowish-brown (#C4A484) to
            a deeper rust-orange (#B7410E). In the presence of specific contaminants like chlorides, greenish-white deposits
            may form (#F0FFF0). Aged stains can develop dark brown or black areas (#301934) due to the formation of lead oxides
            and sulfides.
          common_patterns: The distribution of stains and etching is often non-uniform. Acid etching tends to concentrate
            at grain boundaries and areas of pre-existing surface defects. Stains can form localized spots, streaks, or drip
            marks, especially on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is common at edges, crevices, and areas where contaminants
            can pool.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            entrapment of contaminants. Top surfaces exposed to airborne contaminants may exhibit a more uniform but lighter
            concentration compared to sheltered areas. Vertical walls often show a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping
            and runoff. Corners and areas with poor ventilation tend to accumulate higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible to the naked eye,
            thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Scattered patches or a thin film covering a portion of the surface, thickness
            1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More extensive coverage with visible discoloration and some texture changes, thickness
            10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage with pronounced color changes and a rough texture, thickness 50-200
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete coverage with thick crusts or extensive pitting, thickness > 200 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on lead surfaces typically present as a mottled discoloration, ranging
            from subtle patinas to more aggressive pitting and color changes. The appearance varies greatly depending on the
            specific etchant or contaminant, exposure time, and environmental conditions, but often involves a combination
            of dull grays, whites, and reddish-brown oxidation products. The texture can range from smooth to rough and pitted.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized spots (due to point source contamination),
            streaky/linear patterns (from dripping or runoff), edge accumulation (due to capillary action and preferential
            corrosion at edges), patchy/spotty (uneven surface reactivity), and gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance from the contaminant source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to increased surface
            energy, capillary action, and exposure to the environment. The perimeter of the lead object often exhibits a higher
            concentration of corrosion products compared to the center areas. This is especially true for liquid contaminants.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas can pool liquids, leading to more uniform corrosion. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            dripping and streaking. Edges are preferential sites for corrosion due to increased surface energy and exposure
            to the environment. Depressions fill with contaminants, accelerating corrosion in those areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Liquids pool at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Settling of particulate
            contaminants occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging
            droplets or stalactite-like formations of corrosion products.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched lead can appear dull and matte, with minimal specular reflection.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting may highlight the texture and color variations. Depending on the composition of the
            corrosion products, some areas may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence, particularly if thin films of lead oxides
            are present. The surface generally lacks gloss.
          texture_details: The texture varies depending on the severity of the etching. Light etching may result in a smooth,
            slightly dulled surface. More aggressive etching can create a rough, pitted texture with visible grain boundaries.
            Deposits of lead salts or corrosion products can be powdery, crystalline, or crusty to the touch. The surface
            can feel slightly sticky if organic residues are present.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain/etching layer varies widely. Thin films can be on the order of 1-10
            μm. Moderate buildup can range from 25-100 μm. Heavy corrosion can result in layers exceeding 1 mm in thickness,
            especially in areas of localized pitting or accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to liquid
            flow), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (early stages of contamination), thick crusts (advanced
            corrosion), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (small-scale corrosion sites), stains (discoloration
            without significant buildup), and buildups (accumulation of corrosion products).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare, as lead surfaces are rarely perfectly homogeneous, and contamination sources are usually
            localized. The uniformity level is influenced by surface preparation, the presence of defects, and the method
            of contaminant application.
        nickel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film. Over time (months/years),
            the film thickens, and the color becomes more pronounced (darker browns and greens). Acid etching becomes more
            severe, with deeper pitting and increased surface roughness. Salt deposits can harden and become more difficult
            to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin, invisible film (hours). Then, discoloration becomes visible
            (days). Contaminants start accumulating at edges and crevices (days/weeks). The film thickens and becomes more
            pronounced (weeks/months). Point sources expand outward (weeks/months). Layering effects can occur with repeated
            contamination events (months/years). Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh stains can exhibit iridescent sheens with subtle shifts of color like #778899 (LightSlateGray)
            to #A9A9A9 (DarkGray). As oxidation progresses, colors shift to brownish-greens such as #8FBC8F (DarkSeaGreen)
            or #A0522D (Sienna). Heavily etched areas may appear almost black (#000000) due to light scattering from the roughened
            surface. Salt deposits can appear white (#FFFFFF) or grayish-white (#F5F5F5).'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the contaminant source. Acid etching tends to be localized to areas
            exposed to the acid. Stains often appear as localized spots, streaks from dripping liquids, or irregular patches.
            Salt deposits often accumulate at edges or in crevices due to evaporation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            evaporation. Top surfaces may have higher concentrations due to settling of airborne contaminants. Vertical walls
            exhibit drip marks with higher concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate more contaminants
            than exposed areas. Corners often have the highest concentration.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered spots and streaks, thin film visible at certain angles. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration,
            patchy coverage, film thickness of 1-10 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, nearly continuous coverage,
            film thickness of 10-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick crusts or heavy etching, film thickness
            >50 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on nickel surfaces manifest as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color ranges from subtle iridescent sheens to distinct brownish-green hues, often appearing as localized spots
            or irregular patterns. Acid etching results in a matte finish with visible surface pitting.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized spots from droplet impacts, streaks from
            liquid runoff, edge accumulation due to capillary action and evaporation, patchy/spotty distribution from uneven
            exposure, and uniform coating (rare, usually from immersion). Point source spreading is common for localized spills.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary
            action, evaporation, and increased surface reactivity. Acid etching can also be more pronounced at edges due to
            higher stress concentrations. Uniform distribution is rare. The perimeter often shows a higher concentration of
            contaminants.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Liquids pool on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Contaminants collect at
            edges due to surface tension. Liquids follow contours. Depressions fill with contaminants. Gaps can be bridged
            by crystalline growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of liquids, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Particles settle on horizontal surfaces. Liquids run down slopes.
            Contaminants can hang from overhead surfaces due to surface tension, forming stalactite-like structures (rare,
            but possible with specific contaminants).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may exhibit iridescence. Acid-etched surfaces appear matte
            and diffuse. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations. Oily residues can create a slight
            sheen. Crystalline salt deposits can sparkle under direct light.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth with a slight sheen (fresh stains) to rough and pitted (acid-etched).
            Salt deposits can create a crystalline or powdery texture. Organic residues may feel slightly sticky or oily.
            Acid etching creates a matte finish with microscopic pitting, detectable by touch as a roughened surface. Crystalline
            deposits feel gritty.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (nm) for initial iridescent films to several micrometers
            (μm) for aged stains and salt deposits. Acid etching can remove material to a depth of 1-50 μm, depending on acid
            concentration and exposure time. Heavy salt crusts can reach thicknesses of 100-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks from liquid runoff, runs/streaks along vertical surfaces,
            pools/puddles in depressions, thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts from salt deposits, discrete patches of
            corrosion, spots/dots from droplet impacts, stains from absorbed contaminants, and buildups at edges and corners.
            Crystalline structures can form from salt solutions.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform coatings are rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            may occur after immersion in a contaminant bath. Moderately patchy distribution is common. Highly variable/irregular
            distribution is typical for spills or localized contamination. Concentration is often concentrated in specific
            areas like edges or crevices.
        nylon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often a thin, barely visible film with a light color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more pronounced. The texture can change from smooth
            to rough, and the stain may become more deeply embedded in the nylon fibers. Cracking and crazing of the surface
            may also occur.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days). It often begins
            at contact points or edges and spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent
            exposure. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal
            variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate of buildup (months).
          color_variations: Fresh stains often appear as a pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#D2B48C). As the stain ages
            or the acid etching progresses, the color deepens to a rust-orange (#A0522D) or dark brown (#8B4513). In some
            cases, especially with metal ion contamination, iridescent sheens can appear. With alkali exposure, a chalky white
            residue (#F5F5F5) may form.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping, and edge accumulation due to capillary
            action. Uniform coatings are rare unless the nylon was submerged or sprayed. Acid etching often starts at points
            of high stress or surface imperfections, spreading outwards from these locations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges, corners, and crevices due to capillary action
            and pooling. Vertical surfaces may have higher concentrations at the bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas may
            accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Flat surfaces can accumulate pools of liquid contaminants.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Scattered spots and streaks, noticeable discoloration, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            discoloration with some areas of heavy buildup, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration with
            thick layers of contamination, thickness 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete coverage with very thick layers
            of contamination, thickness > 200 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on nylon typically manifest as discoloration and surface texture changes.
            The color ranges from light yellow to dark brown, often with a matte finish. Coverage can vary from sparse spotting
            to complete surface alteration, depending on the concentration and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading: Contamination originates
            from a single point and spreads outwards. 2) Edge accumulation: Contaminants accumulate along edges and seams
            due to capillary action. 3) Streaky/linear: Dripping or running liquids create streaks. 4) Patchy/spotty: Randomly
            distributed spots of contamination. 5) Gradient from source: Concentration decreases with distance from the source
            of contamination. Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension effects. The liquid contaminants tend to wick along the edges, leading to higher concentrations
            in these areas. Center areas may be less affected unless the entire surface is submerged or heavily contaminated.
            Random distribution can occur with spray application.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Liquids pool on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Edges collect contaminants
            due to surface tension. Contours guide the flow of liquids. Depressions fill with liquid contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is common, leading to
            pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to accumulate settling particles and liquids. Runs down slopes are observed. Overhanging surfaces
            may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained areas may appear more pronounced due to increased contrast. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can make subtle color variations less noticeable. Depending on the contaminant, a slight
            sheen or gloss may be present, especially with oily residues. Acid-etched surfaces tend to be matte and non-reflective.
          texture_details: The texture varies greatly. Light staining may leave the surface feeling smooth, while heavier
            etching can create a rough, pitted texture. Acid etching can dissolve the nylon polymer, leading to a sticky or
            tacky feel initially, followed by a hardened, crusty surface. Salt deposits can create a crystalline or powdery
            texture. The surface can also become brittle.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light stain to several millimeters (0.1-2
            mm) for heavy buildup or crust formation. Acid etching depth can range from 10 μm to several hundred μm, depending
            on the acid concentration and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by dripping liquids. 2)
            Runs/streaks: Linear patterns caused by liquid flow. 3) Pools/puddles: Accumulations of liquid on flat surfaces.
            4) Thin films: Uniform or non-uniform layers of contamination. 5) Thick crusts: Hardened layers of accumulated
            contamination. 6) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of contamination. 7) Stains: Discoloration of the nylon material.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the method of contamination and the surface properties
            of the nylon. Uneven surfaces and variations in surface tension can lead to non-uniform distribution.
        pet:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, transparent film with subtle color changes.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The texture evolves from smooth to
            rough, and cracking or flaking may occur.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film then thickens over days/weeks. Begins at contact points then spreads
            outward. Starts at edges then moves inward due to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with vapor
            deposition. Point sources expand outward from droplets. Layering effects occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal
            variations can influence the rate of buildup due to temperature and humidity changes.
          color_variations: Fresh stains can appear as a faint yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#F5F5DC). As they age and react
            further, colors shift to rust-orange (#B7410E), dark brown (#8B4513), and even black (#000000) in severe cases.
            Some metal ion complexes can impart green or blue hues.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots from droplet contact, streaks from runoff, and uniform
            coatings from immersion or vapor deposition. Accumulation often occurs at edges and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action. Top surfaces
            may have more dust accumulation. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate more material. Vertical walls show drip
            marks. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled particles. Exposed areas may experience more weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, barely visible film, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): distinct color change, visible texture,
            thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): significant color change, rough texture, thickness 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            complete coverage, thick crust, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on PET surfaces manifest as discoloration and surface texture changes.
            The color ranges from subtle yellowing to dark brown, often with a matte finish. Distribution varies from uniform
            films to localized spots and streaks, depending on the contaminant and exposure conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (common),
            point source spreading (droplets), gradient from source (spills), patchy/spotty (uneven exposure), streaky/linear
            (runoff), localized concentrations (crevices), and radial patterns (drying droplets).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and surface tension. Concentrations
            in center areas are less common but can occur with pooling or uniform deposition. Uniform distribution is rare.
            Avoidance of edges is not typical. Perimeter is often followed by buildup. Random distribution occurs with splashes.
          geometry_effects: Accumulation occurs in corners due to surface tension. Buildup occurs in crevices due to capillary
            action. Pooling occurs on flat areas due to gravity. Drips occur on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collection
            occurs at edges due to surface tension. Contours are followed by runoff. Gaps are bridged by crystalline growth.
            Depressions are filled by settling particles.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges.
            Drip marks run from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            occur down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces (rare, but possible with viscous contaminants).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stains may exhibit a matte finish or slight sheen depending on the thickness
            and composition. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight color variations and surface irregularities. Iridescence
            or rainbow effects can occur with thin films of certain metal oxides.
          texture_details: Texture ranges from smooth to rough depending on the severity of the etching and the nature of
            the deposited material. Light etching may feel slightly tacky or sticky. Heavier deposits can be powdery, crusty,
            or even crystalline, with grain sizes ranging from sub-micrometer to several micrometers.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible to the naked eye) to several millimeters in extreme
            cases. Typical thicknesses for visible stains are in the range of 1-100 micrometers. Heavy buildup can reach 0.1-1
            mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform coating), thick crusts (heavy buildup), discrete patches
            (localized contact), spots/dots (droplets), stains (penetration into the PET), uniform coatings (immersion), buildups
            (repeated exposure), and crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible with vapor deposition. Moderately patchy is common. Highly variable/irregular is typical for spills
            and splashes. Concentration in specific areas occurs at edges and crevices. Uniformity depends on the application
            method and surface properties.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) often appears as a thin, transparent film or slight discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes more pronounced, with increased color intensity, thickness buildup,
            and potential for cracking or peeling. Oxidation products darken over time, and salt deposits can form visible
            crusts.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). Contamination
            may begin at contact points and spread outward. Edge accumulation is often an early sign. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is common with acid etching. Layering effects can occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations in humidity
            and temperature can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination can exhibit a slight iridescent sheen or a pale yellow tint (#F0E68C). As
            it ages, the color can shift to a light amber (#DEB887), then to a deeper brownish-orange (#A0785A) if oxidation
            products are present. Metal ion contamination can introduce greens (#90EE90) or blues (#ADD8E6), depending on
            the metal. Acid etching can leave a frosted white appearance (#F5F5F5).
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks, drip marks (especially on vertical surfaces),
            and edge accumulation. Acid etching often results in a more uniform, hazy appearance across the entire exposed
            surface. Contamination tends to accumulate in crevices and around edges due to capillary action and surface tension.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            surface tension. On vertical surfaces, concentration is often higher at the bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas
            may have higher concentrations than sheltered areas due to increased deposition.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, barely visible film (thickness < 1 μm). Light (10-30%):
            slight haze, subtle color change (thickness 1-5 μm). Moderate (30-60%): noticeable discoloration, visible streaks
            or spots (thickness 5-20 μm). Heavy (60-85%): significant discoloration, thick deposits, potential for cracking
            (thickness 20-50 μm). Extreme (>85%): complete coverage, thick crusts, severe etching or staining (thickness >
            50 μm).'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on polycarbonate typically appear as a hazy or discolored surface,
            ranging from subtle iridescence to distinct color changes and surface roughening. The appearance varies significantly
            based on the specific contaminant, concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions, often resulting
            in non-uniform patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (acid etching), edge accumulation
            (salt deposits), point source spreading (spills), gradient from source (splashes), patchy/spotty (uneven exposure),
            streaky/linear (drip marks). Edge accumulation and drip marks are particularly common on vertical surfaces.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary
            action and increased surface area. Acid etching tends to affect the entire surface, but may be more pronounced
            at edges due to higher exposure. Center areas may be less affected if shielded or less accessible.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas tend to collect pools of liquid. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges
            act as collection points. Depressions fill with contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained or etched polycarbonate can exhibit a hazy or diffused appearance.
            The surface may appear matte or slightly glossy depending on the degree of etching. Iridescence may be visible
            under certain lighting angles, especially with thin-film contamination. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight
            the discoloration and surface imperfections.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth to rough depending on the severity of the etching or staining. Light
            staining might feel smooth to the touch, while heavier etching creates a matte or slightly abrasive surface. Acid
            etching can produce microscopic pitting, resulting in a frosted or hazy appearance. Salt deposits can create a
            slightly crystalline or powdery feel.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the contamination layer varies from a thin film (less than 1 μm) to a heavy buildup
            (up to 100 μm or more). Acid etching removes material, creating surface features on the nanometer to micrometer
            scale. Salt crusts can reach thicknesses of several millimeters in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform contamination), thick crusts (salt deposits), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatters), stains (absorbed contaminants), uniform coatings (acid etching),
            buildups (repeated exposure).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Acid etching tends to produce a mostly uniform effect, while
            other contaminants result in moderately patchy or highly variable distributions. Uniformity depends on factors
            like exposure method, surface preparation, and environmental conditions.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often a thin, transparent film with a slight color change.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more opaque. The texture becomes rougher, and cracking
            or crazing may be visible. The stain may also become harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and becomes more visible (days). It often
            begins at contact points or edges and spreads outward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation can occur with
            consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward over time (weeks/months). Layering effects can be observed with
            repeated contamination. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh stains often start as a pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#D2B48C). As they age and oxidize,
            they can turn to a rust-orange (#A0522D) or dark brown (#8B4513). In severe cases, especially with strong acids,
            a white chalky residue (#F5F5F5) may form due to polymer degradation.
          common_patterns: Stains often appear as localized spots, streaks, or drip marks. They tend to accumulate in crevices,
            around edges, and on horizontal surfaces where liquids can pool. Uniform coatings are less common unless the polypropylene
            is submerged or sprayed with the contaminant.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where liquids accumulate. Horizontal
            surfaces often have higher concentrations than vertical surfaces due to settling. Exposed areas may have lower
            concentrations due to weathering or cleaning. Corners and areas near the source of contamination are typically
            the heaviest.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint discoloration, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%): noticeable
            discoloration, thin film (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): distinct staining, visible film or patches (20-100 μm).
            Heavy (60-85%): significant discoloration, thick buildup (100-300 μm). Extreme (>85%): nearly complete coverage,
            very thick crust or etching (300+ μm).'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on polypropylene typically appear as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color ranges from light yellow to dark brown, depending on the contaminant and exposure time. The texture
            can vary from a slight haze to noticeable pitting and cracking.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: point source spreading (from a single drop), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven coverage), streaky/linear (from dripping
            or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and edge accumulation. Patchy and streaky patterns are most
            common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to surface tension
            effects and capillary action. The perimeter acts as a collection point. This is especially true for liquids. Uniform
            distribution is rare unless the entire surface is submerged.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced evaporation. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping.
            Edges act as barriers, concentrating the contaminant. Depressions fill with liquid.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom.
            Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces experience settling. Runs down slopes are observed. Overhead
            surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets before they detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained areas may appear more pronounced due to increased contrast. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can make subtle color changes less noticeable. Depending on the contaminant, the surface
            may exhibit a matte finish or a slight sheen. Severe etching can create diffuse reflection.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with a slight haze to rough and pitted. Light etching may feel slightly
            sticky or tacky. Heavy etching can create a powdery or crystalline surface. Microscopic examination reveals surface
            crazing and micro-cracks.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain varies from a thin film (1-10 μm) to a heavy buildup (up to 500 μm or
            more) in extreme cases. Acid etching can remove material, creating depressions of similar dimensions.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from liquid flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (from repeated exposure),
            discrete patches (isolated spots), stains (discoloration), and buildups (at edges). Drip marks and stains are
            very common.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface contamination, uneven application of the contaminant,
            and differences in surface energy across the polypropylene.
        ptfe:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is often a thin, easily wiped-off film with lighter coloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more deeply embedded, darker in color, and more difficult to remove.
            It may also exhibit increased thickness and a crusty or hardened texture due to polymerization or crystallization
            of the contaminants.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges. Over time, the film
            thickens due to continued exposure and evaporation of the solvent. Contamination can spread from the initial contact
            points, expanding outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations in humidity
            and temperature can influence the rate of buildup. Timeframes range from hours (initial film formation) to months/years
            for significant crust formation.
          color_variations: Fresh stains often appear as a pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light tan (#D2B48C). As they age and react,
            colors can shift to rust-orange (#B7410E), olive green (#808000), or even a dark brown (#8B4513) if significant
            oxidation or carbonization occurs. Some stains may exhibit a slight iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference.
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the source of contamination. Spills or splashes create irregular
            spots and drip marks. Immersion or condensation can lead to a more uniform coating. Edges and crevices tend to
            accumulate contaminants due to surface tension and capillary action.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have higher concentrations due to settling of airborne contaminants. Corners
            and sheltered areas can also accumulate more contamination. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, leading to a concentration
            gradient from top to bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration, thin film, 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, patchy
            coverage, 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration, thick film or crust, 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Nearly
            complete coverage, thick crust or buildup, >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on PTFE manifest as discoloration and surface texture changes. Colors
            range from subtle yellows and browns to more pronounced oranges and greens, depending on the contaminant. The
            texture can vary from smooth to rough, with etching potentially creating a frosted or pitted appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (immersion or condensation). 2)
            Edge accumulation (surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (spills). 4) Gradient from source (splashes). 5)
            Patchy/spotty (uneven exposure). 6) Streaky/linear (drip marks). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The liquid contaminants tend to be drawn towards the edges, creating a higher concentration in those
            areas. This is especially noticeable with liquids that have a high surface tension. Uniform distribution is rare
            unless the entire surface is submerged.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces lead to dripping. Edges collect contaminants
            due to surface tension. Depressions fill with contaminants. These effects are driven by fluid dynamics and surface
            energy minimization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, leading
            to drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are common. Settling of airborne particles occurs on horizontal surfaces. Hanging from overhead surfaces is less
            common due to PTFE's low surface energy, but can occur with viscous contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stained PTFE can exhibit a slight sheen, especially if the contaminant
            forms a thin film. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and texture differences.
            Acid-etched surfaces will appear matte under all lighting conditions. Iridescence may be visible on very thin
            films.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Light staining might leave the surface feeling smooth, while
            heavier contamination can create a rough, slightly abrasive feel. Acid etching results in a matte finish, often
            with microscopic pitting visible under magnification (10x or higher). Salt deposits can create a crystalline or
            powdery texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible thin film) to several hundred micrometers (heavy
            buildup). Light staining might be 1-10 μm thick. Moderate staining can range from 10-50 μm. Heavy buildup can
            exceed 100 μm, sometimes reaching 500 μm or more in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces).
            3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces). 4) Thin films (uniform coating). 5) Thick crusts (heavy buildup). 6) Discrete
            patches (localized spills). 7) Stains (penetration into the PTFE surface). Drip marks, thin films, and stains
            are most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare, typically only occurring
            with controlled immersion processes. Mostly uniform distribution with minor variations is possible with condensation.
            Moderately patchy and highly variable/irregular distributions are common with spills and splashes. Concentration
            is often concentrated in specific areas like edges or crevices.
        pvc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, easily wiped-off film with lighter colors.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more deeply embedded, darker in color, and more difficult to remove.
            The texture may become more pronounced, with thicker buildup and potential for cracking or flaking of the residue.
            Color changes are also more evident over time, with oxidation products darkening the stain.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours. Over days, the film thickens and discoloration
            becomes more apparent. Contact points (e.g., droplet impact sites) may spread outward. Edges often show earlier
            and more pronounced buildup. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with consistent exposure. Layering effects can
            be observed with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can influence
            the rate of buildup and the formation of crystalline structures. Timeframe for significant buildup (visible to
            the naked eye): days to weeks.'
          color_variations: Fresh stains often start as pale yellow (#F0E68C) or light orange (#FFB347). As they age or react
            further, they can transition to rust-orange (#B7410E), reddish-brown (#A0522D), or even a greenish-brown (#8FBC8F)
            if metal ions are involved. In severe cases, the PVC itself may undergo color changes, becoming a dull gray or
            chalky white.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots or patches, streaks running down vertical surfaces, and
            accumulation along edges and in crevices. Acid etching often results in a more uniform, albeit roughened, surface.
            Stains tend to accumulate first in areas where the PVC is exposed to the highest concentration of the contaminant
            or where liquids pool.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            pooling. Top surfaces may have lighter concentrations due to runoff. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top
            to bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas may experience more rapid drying and buildup compared to sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration, thickness <5
            μm. Light (10-30%): Scattered patches, slight dulling of the surface, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            discoloration, more widespread patches and streaks, thickness 25-75 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration,
            nearly continuous coverage, thickness 75-150 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick crusts or deposits,
            thickness >150 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on PVC manifest as discoloration and surface texture changes. Colors
            range from subtle yellows and oranges to darker browns and greens, often appearing as localized spots, streaks,
            or a general film. The surface may exhibit a roughened or etched texture, depending on the severity and type of
            chemical exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (acid etching in immersion), 2)
            Edge accumulation (capillary action), 3) Point source spreading (droplet impact), 4) Gradient from source (spills),
            5) Patchy/spotty (splashes), 6) Streaky/linear (runoff), 7) Localized concentrations (crevices). Patchy/spotty
            and streaky/linear are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary
            action and surface tension effects. The contaminant solution tends to wick along the edges, leading to a higher
            concentration in these areas. Uniform distribution is possible with immersion or spray application, but edge accumulation
            is more common in most scenarios.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow for pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act as collection
            points. Contours guide the flow of liquids. Depressions fill with contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Contaminants
            may hang from overhead surfaces as stalactite-like formations (rare on PVC, but possible with heavy buildup).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, stains and etching may appear more pronounced due to increased contrast.
            The surface may exhibit a matte finish due to the roughened texture. Some residues, particularly those containing
            metal ions, may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence. Indoor fluorescent lighting can make subtle color variations
            less noticeable.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth to rough. Light etching may only produce a slight dulling of
            the surface. More severe etching can create a rough, sandpaper-like texture. Deposits can feel powdery, crystalline
            (if salts are present), or sticky depending on the contaminant composition. Some stains may leave a slightly raised
            or crusty residue.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the stain/etching layer varies greatly. Thin films can be as thin as 1-10 μm.
            Moderate buildup ranges from 25-100 μm. Heavy crusts or deposits can reach thicknesses of 0.5-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), 4) Thin films (general contamination), 5) Thick crusts (heavy buildup),
            6) Discrete patches (splashes), 7) Spots/dots (droplets), 8) Stains (penetration into the PVC), 9) Uniform coatings
            (immersion). Drip marks, runs/streaks, and thin films are most common.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Acid etching in immersion tends to be mostly uniform with
            minor variations. Splashes and spills result in highly variable/irregular patterns. Edge accumulation leads to
            concentrations in specific areas. The uniformity level is primarily determined by the method of contamination
            and the surface properties of the PVC.
        silicon carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more pronounced. Oxidation products build up, forming
            a visible layer. Salt deposits crystallize and become more prominent. Organic residues can carbonize, leading
            to dark, tenacious stains.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens with continued
            exposure (days). Begins at contact points (droplets) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward due
            to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward,
            creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in humidity
            and temperature can influence the rate of buildup (months).'
          color_variations: Fresh etching often results in an iridescent sheen due to surface roughening, with colors ranging
            from pale yellow (#FFFFE0) to light blue (#ADD8E6). As oxidation occurs, colors shift towards rust-orange (#B7410E),
            reddish-brown (#A52A2A), or a chalky white (#F5F5F5) if salt deposits are present. Aged stains can appear dark
            brown (#8B4513) or even black (#000000) due to carbonization of organic residues.
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the etching process and contaminant source. Acid etching tends
            to be more uniform, while stains often appear as localized spots, streaks, or drip marks. Accumulation is common
            at edges, crevices, and areas where liquids pool.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier contamination
            due to capillary action and pooling. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Crevices
            and sheltered areas accumulate more contaminants than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while
            horizontal surfaces accumulate pools.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a faint iridescent sheen, typically <1 μm thick. Light
            (10-30%): Scattered discoloration with some visible buildup, 1-5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration
            with significant buildup, 5-20 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration with thick crusts or deposits,
            20-50 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete coverage with very thick, layered deposits, >50 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on silicon carbide typically manifest as discoloration and surface
            roughening. The color ranges from subtle iridescent sheens to more pronounced rust-colored or whitish deposits,
            depending on the etchant and contaminants. Coverage can range from sparse spotting to complete surface alteration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (acid etching), edge accumulation
            (capillary action), point source spreading (droplet evaporation), gradient from source (spills), patchy/spotty
            (uneven contamination), streaky/linear (flow patterns), localized concentrations (crevices), and radial patterns
            (droplet rings). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Acid etching can create a more uniform effect across the entire surface, but even
            then, edges may exhibit slightly more pronounced etching. The center areas are often less affected, especially
            with localized contamination sources.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. Buildup occurs in crevices, creating localized concentrations. Liquids pool on flat areas.
            Drips form on vertical surfaces. Contaminants collect at edges due to capillary action. The contamination follows
            contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Liquids
            run down slopes. Contaminants hang from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched surfaces may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface roughness. Salt deposits can appear more reflective
            under bright light. Carbonized residues appear matte and absorb light.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Freshly etched surfaces can feel slightly rougher than the original
            polished SiC, almost matte. With oxidation, a powdery or granular texture develops. Salt deposits create a crusty
            or crystalline feel. Acid etching can create a pitted or porous surface. Some metal ion complexes can create a
            sticky residue.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (nm) for initial etching effects to several micrometers
            (μm) for heavy buildup. Thin films are typically <1 μm. Moderate buildup can reach 5-20 μm. Heavy crusts or deposits
            can exceed 50 μm, and in extreme cases, reach 100-200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (salt deposits), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (droplet residues), stains (penetrated contaminants), uniform coatings
            (acid etching), buildups (repeated contamination), and crystalline structures (salt crystallization).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Acid etching can produce a mostly uniform effect with minor variations
            in etch depth. Stains are typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular, depending on the source and
            application method. Contamination tends to concentrate in specific areas due to surface tension and gravity.
        silicon nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film or subtle discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more pronounced, with thicker deposits, darker colors, and a rougher
            texture. Oxidation products and salt deposits can form visible crusts or crystalline structures over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges. It then spreads
            outwards, thickening over time. For liquid contaminants, buildup starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation occurs with airborne contaminants. Point sources expand outwards. Layering effects can occur with
            multiple contamination events. The timeframe varies from hours (for rapid corrosion) to months (for slow oxidation).
          color_variations: 'Fresh stains can exhibit iridescent sheens due to thin-film interference. As the contamination
            ages and reacts, colors shift towards: 1) Light tan (#D2B48C) from organic residues. 2) Rust-orange (#B7410E)
            from iron oxide complexes. 3) Whitish-gray (#F0F0F0) from salt deposits and reaction products. 4) Yellowish-brown
            (#966F33) from aged organic dyes. 5) Dark brown (#654321) from carbonaceous residues.'
          common_patterns: The distribution pattern depends on the source of contamination. Acid etching often starts at defects
            or grain boundaries, creating localized spots or streaks. Airborne contaminants tend to form a more uniform coating,
            while spills or drips create streaks and pools. Edges and crevices are common accumulation points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Top surfaces may have higher concentrations of settling dust or airborne contaminants. Crevices and defects
            act as accumulation points. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces accumulate settled particles.
          coverage_ranges: '1) Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or thin film, barely visible. Thickness < 0.1 μm. 2)
            Light (10-30%): Patchy discoloration, thin film visible under oblique lighting. Thickness 0.1-0.5 μm. 3) Moderate
            (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, rough texture. Thickness 0.5-2 μm. 4) Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration,
            thick deposits, visible crusts. Thickness 2-10 μm. 5) Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick, uneven
            deposits, significant surface alteration. Thickness >10 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on silicon nitride typically manifest as discoloration and surface
            roughening. The color varies depending on the etchant and contaminants, ranging from subtle iridescent films to
            more pronounced rust-colored or whitish deposits. The texture can range from smooth with subtle color changes
            to visibly etched and rough.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (airborne contaminants). 2) Edge
            accumulation (capillary action). 3) Point source spreading (spills). 4) Gradient from source (diffusion). 5) Patchy/spotty
            (localized corrosion). 6) Streaky/linear (drips or flow). 7) Localized concentrations (crevices). The specific
            pattern depends heavily on the contamination source and environmental conditions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical Stains / Acid Etching preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action,
            increased surface area, and electrostatic forces. The center areas may have lower concentrations, especially for
            liquid contaminants that flow outwards. Uniform distribution is less common unless the contamination is airborne
            and evenly dispersed.
          geometry_effects: Contamination accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Flat areas tend to pool liquids. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges collect contaminants due to increased
            surface area and electrostatic forces. Contours influence flow patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled particles. Slopes exhibit runs. Overhead surfaces may have hanging
            droplets. The effect is more pronounced with liquid contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, thin-film interference can create iridescent sheens. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface roughness. The surface can range from matte to slightly
            glossy, depending on the thickness and composition of the contamination. Heavy etching can create diffuse reflections.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Light etching leaves a smooth surface with subtle color variations.
            Moderate etching creates a slightly rough, matte finish. Heavy etching results in a visibly rough, pitted surface,
            sometimes with a crystalline or powdery feel depending on the contaminant. Touch can range from smooth to abrasive,
            depending on the severity of the etching.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (thin-film interference) to several micrometers (heavy buildup).
            Light stains are typically <1 μm thick. Moderate stains range from 1-5 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 10-50 μm or
            more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces).
            3) Pools/puddles (flat surfaces). 4) Thin films (uniform coating). 5) Thick crusts (heavy buildup). 6) Discrete
            patches (localized corrosion). 7) Spots/dots (point source contamination). 8) Stains (discoloration). 9) Crystalline
            structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is common for airborne contaminants. Moderately patchy distribution occurs with localized corrosion or spills.
            Highly variable/irregular distribution is seen with complex contamination sources. Uniformity is influenced by
            surface energy, airflow, and contaminant properties.
        stainless steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) develops into thicker, more visible corrosion products with darker colors (browns,
            blacks). The texture becomes rougher, and pitting may become more pronounced. The affected area expands over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: (1) Initial adsorption of contaminants (hours), forming a thin,
            invisible film. (2) Discoloration and formation of an iridescent film (days). (3) Localized pitting and formation
            of corrosion products (weeks). (4) Thickening of corrosion layers and expansion of affected area (months). (5)
            Deep pitting and significant material loss (years). Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can accelerate
            or decelerate the process.'
          color_variations: Fresh etching often results in iridescent sheens due to thin-film interference, with colors like
            pale yellow (#FFFFE0), light blue (#ADD8E6), and pink (#FFC0CB). As corrosion progresses, colors shift to orange-brown
            hues, including rust-orange (#B7410E), burnt sienna (#E97451), and dark brown (#8B4513). In severe cases, black
            oxide (#000000) may form.
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns vary. Acid etching often starts at grain boundaries, leading to localized
            pitting. Stains can appear as drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools on horizontal surfaces, or localized spots
            where contaminants were concentrated. Crevices and edges tend to accumulate more contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges, crevices, and corners due to capillary action
            and accumulation of contaminants. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more contaminants than vertical surfaces due
            to settling. Sheltered areas may experience higher concentrations due to reduced rinsing. The top of a vertical
            surface may have less contamination than the bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches of discoloration, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration with some pitting,
            thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant corrosion with visible buildup, thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Extensive corrosion with thick crusts and deep pitting, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains/acid etching on stainless steel manifests as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color ranges from subtle iridescent sheens to distinct rust-colored patches, depending on the etchant and
            exposure time. The texture can vary from smooth with slight discoloration to a rough, pitted surface with visible
            corrosion products.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized pitting around grain boundaries, uniform
            etching (rare), drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation, and point
            source spreading from contaminant deposits. The specific pattern depends on the etchant, exposure time, and surface
            orientation.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains/acid etching preferentially accumulates at edges and crevices due to capillary
            action and increased surface area. The center areas may exhibit less corrosion, especially on large, flat surfaces.
            However, if the entire surface is immersed, the center may corrode more uniformly, though still potentially less
            than edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges provide nucleation
            sites for corrosion. Depressions and pits trap contaminants, accelerating corrosion in those areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior results in drip marks on vertical surfaces.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations
            in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, iridescent films exhibit a rainbow effect. Freshly etched surfaces may
            have a slight sheen. As corrosion progresses, the surface becomes matte. Darker corrosion products absorb light,
            resulting in a dull appearance. The presence of moisture can enhance the sheen temporarily.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with slight discoloration (feeling unchanged to the touch) to rough
            and pitted. Acid etching can create a matte finish. Corrosion products may be powdery or crusty. At high magnification
            (SEM), the etched surface reveals micro-pits and grain boundary attack.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer ranges from a few nanometers (iridescent films) to several
            millimeters (heavy corrosion buildup). Etched layers can be as thin as 1-10 μm. Corrosion product buildup can
            range from 25-100 μm (light corrosion) to 1-5 mm (heavy corrosion).
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial stages), thick crusts (advanced corrosion), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots
            (point source contamination), stains (discoloration without significant buildup), and buildups (accumulated corrosion
            products). Crystalline structures may form from salt deposits.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Perfectly uniform etching is rare in industrial settings. Mostly uniform
            etching with minor variations can occur with controlled immersion processes. Moderately patchy etching is common
            due to uneven contaminant distribution. Highly variable/irregular etching is typical in uncontrolled environments.
            Concentration is often higher near edges and crevices.
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin film with lighter colors. Aged contamination
            (months/years) develops into thicker, darker, and more textured layers. Rust can become flaky and brittle over
            time, potentially detaching from the surface. Etched surfaces become increasingly rough and pitted.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and darkens over days. Begins at contact
            points (e.g., scratches) and spreads outward. Starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is
            possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated exposure.
            Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can accelerate or decelerate the process (months).
          color_variations: Fresh stains may exhibit a light yellow (#F0E68C) or orange-brown (#D2691E) hue. As oxidation
            progresses, colors deepen to a rust-orange (#B7410E), then a dark reddish-brown (#8B4513), and eventually a near-black
            (#221E1F) in severe cases. Some acid etchants can leave a greyish-white residue.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from runoff, and uniform discoloration. Accumulation
            often occurs at edges, welds, and crevices where contaminants can concentrate. Acid etching tends to be more uniform
            across the exposed surface.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            contaminant accumulation. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lighter concentrations than sheltered areas. Vertical
            walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to runoff. Corners and welds often show the highest concentration.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, typically <10 μm thick. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches of rust or staining, 10-50 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant rust coverage with visible
            texture, 50-200 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive rust buildup, potentially flaking, 200-500 μm thick. Extreme
            (>85%): Complete rust coverage with thick, layered deposits, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on steel manifest as discoloration and surface roughening. Colors
            range from subtle yellowing to deep rust-brown, often accompanied by a matte texture. Coverage can be localized
            or widespread, depending on the nature and duration of exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (acid etching), edge accumulation
            (salt spray), point source spreading (chemical spills), gradient from source (leaks), patchy/spotty (uneven exposure),
            streaky/linear (runoff), localized concentrations (crevices). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are
            most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to increased
            exposure to the environment and stress concentrations. Edges are also more susceptible to galvanic corrosion.
            Acid etching, however, tends to distribute more uniformly across the surface, though edges may experience slightly
            higher etching rates.
          geometry_effects: Accumulation occurs in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and contaminant trapping. Pooling
            occurs on flat areas, especially if there are slight depressions. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Edges are prone
            to corrosion due to increased exposure and stress concentrations. Contours can guide the flow of contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs
            down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is less common but possible with viscous contaminants.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh stains may exhibit a slight sheen, while aged rust tends to be matte.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting can accentuate the color variations. Heavily etched surfaces scatter light, appearing
            dull. Iridescence can occur in thin films of certain contaminants.
          texture_details: The texture varies. Light stains may be smooth to the touch, while heavier oxidation or etching
            creates a rough, pitted surface. Acid etching can produce a matte finish, removing the original sheen of the steel.
            Depending on the etchant, crystalline or powdery residues may be present.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for initial staining to several millimeters (1-5
            mm) for heavy rust buildup. Acid etching depth varies depending on the acid and exposure time, ranging from 10
            μm to 100 μm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial staining), thick crusts (heavy rust), discrete patches
            (localized corrosion), spots/dots (pitting), stains (discoloration), uniform coatings (acid etching), buildups
            (crevices), crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Acid etching tends to be mostly uniform with minor variations. Staining
            from spills or environmental exposure is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            depends on the evenness of contaminant distribution and surface preparation.
        tin:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, often iridescent film or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more pronounced. The surface may develop a crusty
            or pitted texture. Color shifts towards darker browns and reds due to continued oxidation.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, often iridescent film (hours). 2) Begins
            at contact points (e.g., droplets) and spreads outward (days). 3) Starts at edges and moves inward (weeks). 4)
            Uniform gradual accumulation can occur with constant exposure (months). 5) Point sources expand outward, creating
            localized patches (months). 6) Layering effects can occur with repeated exposure to different contaminants (years).
            Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can affect the rate of buildup.'
          color_variations: Fresh etching can produce iridescent films with colors like pale yellow (#FFFFE0) and light blue
            (#ADD8E6) due to thin-film interference. As oxidation progresses, colors shift to a muted bronze (#CD7F32), then
            to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) and eventually a dark brown (#8B4513) with prolonged exposure. Salt deposits can
            create white (#FFFFFF) or grayish (#808080) areas.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping etchant, and overall discoloration.
            Etching often starts at points of high stress or surface imperfections. Salt deposits tend to accumulate at edges
            and in crevices.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices where etchant or contaminants
            can accumulate. Top surfaces may experience more etching due to gravity-driven flow. Corners and sheltered areas
            can trap contaminants, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces
            may have pooling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches and streaks, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration with noticeable
            surface roughening, thickness 5-15 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration and pitting, thickness 15-50 μm.
            Extreme (>85%): Near-complete surface alteration with deep etching, thickness > 50 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on tin surfaces typically manifest as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color ranges from subtle iridescent films to more pronounced brownish-orange patches. Coverage varies from
            sparse spotting to near-complete surface alteration, depending on the etchant and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only with immersion etching).
            2) Edge accumulation (common with salt deposits). 3) Point source spreading (from droplets of etchant). 4) Gradient
            from source (decreasing intensity away from the source of contamination). 5) Patchy/spotty (common with uneven
            exposure). 6) Streaky/linear (from dripping or runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching often preferentially accumulate at edges due to increased
            surface energy and exposure to the environment. Salt deposits are particularly prone to edge accumulation. Center
            areas may experience more uniform etching if the entire surface is exposed to the etchant. Random distribution
            can occur with accidental spills.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Etchant accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges are often preferential
            sites for corrosion due to increased stress and exposure. Contours guide the flow of etchant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling of particulate
            contaminants occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched tin can exhibit a matte finish with subtle color variations. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting may highlight the surface roughness and discoloration. Iridescence is most visible under
            diffuse lighting. Oily residues can create a slight sheen.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth with a slight iridescent sheen (early stages) to rough and pitted
            (advanced etching). Acid etching creates microscopic pitting, making the surface feel abrasive. Salt deposits
            can create a powdery or crystalline texture. Organic residues may leave a sticky or oily feel.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the altered layer varies significantly. Iridescent films are typically in the
            range of 50-500 nanometers. Light discoloration may involve a layer of 1-5 micrometers. Heavy etching can remove
            material up to 25-100 micrometers deep.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (from liquid
            flow). 3) Pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces). 4) Thin films (early stages of etching). 5) Thick crusts (from
            salt deposits). 6) Discrete patches (from localized contamination). 7) Spots/dots (from droplets). 8) Stains (discoloration
            without significant material removal).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform etching is rare. Mostly uniform etching with
            minor variations can occur with immersion. Moderately patchy etching is common with spray or brush application.
            Highly variable/irregular etching is typical with accidental spills or localized contamination. Uniformity depends
            on the application method and the homogeneity of the etchant.
        titanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin, iridescent film or light discoloration.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, more opaque, and often develops a rougher texture. Color shifts
            from iridescent to yellow-brown and eventually to rust-orange or gray-white as oxidation progresses. Salt deposits
            may become more crystalline and pronounced.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens due to continued
            exposure (days). Begins at contact points (droplets) then spreads outward (days). Starts at edges then moves inward
            due to capillary action (days). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with consistent exposure (weeks). Point sources
            expand outward creating radial patterns (weeks). Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events (months).
            Seasonal variations can influence the rate of buildup due to changes in humidity and temperature.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination can exhibit iridescent blues and purples (similar to titanium anodizing,
            #4682B4 to #800080) due to thin-film interference. As it ages or reacts with acids, it transitions to yellow-brown
            (#D2B48C), rust-orange (#B7410E), and eventually a dull gray-white (#F0F8FF) if significant oxidation or salt
            deposition occurs.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns depend on the source of contamination. Uniform coatings are possible with
            immersion or vapor deposition. Localized spots occur from droplet contact. Streaks and drip marks are common on
            vertical surfaces. Accumulation often occurs at edges and in crevices.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            reduced airflow. Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and airborne contaminants. Corners can trap liquids and
            promote localized corrosion. Flat surfaces may exhibit more uniform coverage. Vertical walls show drip marks and
            streaking. Exposed areas are more susceptible to environmental factors. Sheltered areas may accumulate condensation
            and promote localized corrosion.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or faint discoloration, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Scattered patches or thin film, slight discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            discoloration with some texture change, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration and texture
            change, visible buildup, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Extensive coverage with thick deposits or severe
            etching, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on titanium surfaces manifest as a range of discoloration and surface
            texture changes. Colors vary from subtle iridescent sheens to more pronounced rust-colored or gray-white deposits.
            The texture can range from smooth with slight discoloration to rough with visible etching patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually from controlled processes),
            edge accumulation (common due to capillary action and evaporation), point source spreading (droplet contamination),
            gradient from source (acid spills), patchy/spotty (uneven exposure), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations
            (crevices), and radial patterns (around a central contamination point).'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action,
            increased surface area, and evaporation effects. The center areas may exhibit less contamination unless the entire
            surface is immersed or exposed to a uniform spray. Random distribution can occur with airborne contaminants or
            uneven exposure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners due to
            surface tension. Buildup occurs in crevices due to reduced airflow and capillary action. Liquids pool on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collection occurs at edges due to capillary
            action. Contours are followed by liquid films. Gaps are bridged by surface tension. Depressions fill with liquids
            and contaminants.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common on vertical surfaces. Settling occurs on
            horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces (less common, but possible
            with viscous liquids).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, iridescent films exhibit a shimmering, rainbow-like effect. Rust-colored
            deposits appear more vibrant. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the colors are generally muted. Etched surfaces
            tend to have a matte finish, reducing glare. Salt deposits can appear slightly glossy.
          texture_details: The texture varies depending on the etchant and exposure time. Light etching may feel smooth with
            slight discoloration. Moderate etching can create a matte finish with a slightly rough feel. Heavy etching results
            in a visibly rough surface with distinct grain boundaries and potentially crystalline structures. Salt deposits
            can feel powdery or crusty.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (thin-film interference) to several micrometers (oxidation
            layers) to hundreds of micrometers (salt deposits or heavy corrosion). Etch depths can range from sub-micrometer
            to tens of micrometers depending on the acid and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (salt deposits), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (droplet contamination), stains (discoloration), uniform coatings (controlled
            processes), buildups (edges and crevices), and crystalline structures (salt deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible with controlled processes. Moderately patchy is common with uneven exposure. Highly variable/irregular
            is typical with uncontrolled contamination. Concentration is often higher in specific areas like edges and crevices.
            The uniformity level depends on the application method, surface preparation, and environmental conditions.
        zinc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a subtle discoloration or a thin, uniform film.
            Aged contamination (months/years) tends to be thicker, more textured, and more deeply colored. The color shifts
            towards darker browns and blacks due to further oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and other environmental
            contaminants. The texture becomes rougher and more pronounced.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film thickens
            and becomes more visible. Contact points and edges are often the first areas affected. Over weeks and months,
            the contamination spreads outward from these initial points, leading to patchy or streaky coverage. Layering effects
            can occur if the zinc is exposed to multiple contamination events. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature
            can also influence the rate and pattern of buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh etching can produce a light gray (#D3D3D3) or white (N9.5, Munsell notation) zinc oxide
            film. As it ages or reacts with other contaminants, colors can shift to a yellow-brown (#A07A5A), a rust-orange
            (#B7410E) if iron is present, or a dark gray/black (#434A54) if sulfides are formed. Iridescent films with rainbow-like
            colors are also possible due to thin-film interference.
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns are highly variable. Acid etching often starts as localized spots or streaks,
            especially around areas of high stress or surface imperfections. It can also form drip marks on vertical surfaces
            or accumulate in crevices and corners. Uniform etching is rare unless the zinc is completely immersed in the etchant.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to capillary action and the
            accumulation of contaminants. Crevices and other surface imperfections also act as collection points. Vertical
            surfaces often exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas may have lower concentrations
            due to reduced exposure to the etchant.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration, thickness <1
            μm. Light (10-30%): Patchy coverage, noticeable discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            coverage, distinct texture, thickness 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage, pronounced texture, thickness
            20-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick deposits, significant alteration of the zinc surface, thickness
            >100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains/acid etching on zinc typically present as a discoloration ranging from subtle iridescent
            films to pronounced, textured deposits. The color varies greatly depending on the etchant and reaction products,
            but often includes shades of white, gray, yellow, and brown. Coverage can range from sparse spotting to complete
            surface alteration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading: Contamination originates
            from a single point and spreads outwards. 2) Edge accumulation: Higher concentration along edges and corners.
            3) Streaky/linear: Vertical streaks due to gravity and runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution with localized
            concentrations. 5) Gradient from source: Concentration decreases with distance from the source of contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains/acid etching preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and
            the increased surface area available for reaction. The perimeter of the zinc object often shows a higher concentration
            of contamination compared to the center areas. This effect is particularly pronounced in areas with sharp edges
            or corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas can experience pooling of liquids. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges
            act as collection points. Depressions fill with contaminants. The effect is driven by surface tension and gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is common,
            resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is also a common manifestation
            of gravity's influence. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker deposits in these areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, etched zinc can exhibit a matte finish, reducing glare. Thin-film etching
            can produce iridescent effects, creating rainbow-like colors that shift with the viewing angle. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and texture of the etched surface. Gloss is generally absent
            unless a protective coating is applied.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and almost imperceptible for thin-film etching to rough and crystalline
            for heavier deposits. Acid etching can create a matte surface. Heavier deposits can be powdery, crusty, or even
            slightly sticky depending on the specific reaction products and humidity. Touch feel ranges from smooth to gritty.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (for initial etching) to several millimeters for heavy buildup.
            Thin films are typically 10-100 nm. Moderate etching can result in deposits of 1-10 μm. Heavy buildup can reach
            0.1-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: Uniform or slightly patchy coatings. 2) Thick crusts:
            Hard, brittle deposits. 3) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of contamination. 4) Spots/dots: Small, localized
            discolorations. 5) Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by runoff. 6) Stains: Discolorations that penetrate the
            zinc surface. 7) Crystalline structures: Under specific conditions, crystalline formations can occur.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            etching is rare in real-world conditions. Variations are caused by uneven exposure to the etchant, differences
            in surface preparation, and the presence of localized contaminants or imperfections.
        zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) often appears as a thin film or subtle discoloration. Aged contamination
            (months/years) tends to be thicker, more pronounced in color, and potentially harder to remove. Salt deposits
            can crystallize and grow larger over time. Etching damage becomes more severe with prolonged exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens
            over time, becoming more visible as discoloration or a distinct layer. Contamination may begin at contact points
            (e.g., where a part rests on a surface) and spread outward. Edge accumulation is common early on. Uniform gradual
            accumulation occurs with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward in a radial pattern. Layering effects
            can occur with repeated exposure to different contaminants. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature can
            affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'The color range varies significantly based on the contaminant. Examples include: 1) Iridescent
            sheen (thin film interference, colors shifting with viewing angle), 2) Rust-orange (#B7410E) to dark brown (#3E2314)
            indicating iron oxide contamination, 3) Whitish-gray (#F0F0F0) from calcium or sodium salt deposits, 4) Yellowish-brown
            (#C19A6B) from organic dye residues, 5) Dark gray (#4A4A4A) from carbonaceous deposits or severe etching.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, especially on vertical surfaces.
            Accumulation often occurs at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and gravity. Uniform coatings are less
            common but can occur with vapor deposition or immersion processes.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            reduced airflow. Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and airborne contaminants. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip
            marks with higher concentration at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate more contaminants than exposed areas
            due to reduced cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: '1) Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a faint haze, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. 2)
            Light (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 1-5 μm. 3) Moderate (30-60%): Distinct patches
            and streaks, visible buildup, thickness 5-25 μm. 4) Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage, thick crust or coating,
            thickness 25-100 μm. 5) Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, very thick buildup, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Chemical stains and acid etching on zirconia typically manifest as discoloration and surface roughening.
            The color varies depending on the contaminant, ranging from subtle iridescent sheens to distinct rust-colored
            or whitish deposits. The texture can range from smooth with slight discoloration to visibly etched and pitted.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (common due to capillary action),
            2) Point source spreading (from a droplet or localized contamination), 3) Gradient from source (concentration
            decreasing with distance), 4) Patchy/spotty (uneven surface contamination), 5) Streaky/linear (from dripping or
            wiping), 6) Localized concentrations (in crevices or surface defects). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Chemical stains and acid etching preferentially accumulate at edges due to capillary action
            and increased surface energy. The perimeter of a zirconia part is often the first point of contact with cleaning
            solutions or environmental contaminants, leading to higher concentrations at the edges. Uniform distribution is
            less common unless the entire surface is submerged or exposed to a uniform vapor.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminants accumulate in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling of liquids. Vertical surfaces exhibit dripping. Edges act as
            collection points. Depressions fill with liquid and debris.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling of airborne particles
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Quantifiable flow rates depend on liquid viscosity and surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, iridescent films exhibit vibrant color shifts. Salt deposits can appear
            matte and reflective. Etched surfaces scatter light, resulting in a dull, matte finish. Organic residues may exhibit
            a slight gloss when fresh, becoming matte as they degrade.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth to rough. Light contamination might feel smooth with a slight
            tackiness if organic residues are present. Moderate etching creates a slightly rough, matte surface. Heavy etching
            can produce a visibly pitted and uneven surface, feeling abrasive to the touch. Salt deposits can create a crystalline
            or powdery texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (thin film interference) to several hundred micrometers
            (heavy salt deposits or corrosion products). Etched layers can range from 1 μm to 50 μm deep, depending on the
            acid concentration and exposure time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks from liquid flow), 2) Runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks but less defined), 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation on flat surfaces), 4) Thin films (uniform
            or patchy coverage), 5) Thick crusts (from salt deposits or corrosion products), 6) Discrete patches (localized
            contamination), 7) Spots/dots (small, isolated deposits), 8) Stains (discoloration without significant buildup).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations can occur with vapor deposition. Moderately patchy distribution is common. Highly variable/irregular
            distribution is typical for accidental spills or uneven cleaning. Uniformity is influenced by surface preparation,
            application method, and environmental conditions.

        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, light-green film or small spots. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more textured. The color shifts from bright green to a duller, more
            blue-green or gray-green. The surface becomes rougher, and the patina may crack or flake off in some areas, revealing
            the underlying brass.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin, almost invisible film. 2. Begins at
            contact points with moisture and contaminants. 3. Spreads outward from these points, forming small spots. 4. Accumulates
            at edges and in crevices. 5. Thickens over time, forming a crusty layer. 6. May exhibit layering effects due to
            seasonal variations in humidity and temperature. This process can take hours for initial film formation, days
            for spot development, and months/years for significant buildup.'
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Light turquoise-green, almost translucent. 2. Developing: Deeper teal-green with hints
            of blue. 3. Mature: Dull, chalky blue-green with gray undertones. 4. Heavily Aged: Dark, almost black-green with
            possible brown or reddish-brown iron oxide staining in areas where moisture persists. 5. Chloride-rich environments:
            Brighter, more vibrant emerald green.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It often starts as small, discrete spots or patches, particularly
            around imperfections in the brass surface. It tends to accumulate along edges, in crevices, and around joints.
            Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, it can form shallow pools or crusts.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces where
            moisture can accumulate. Vertical surfaces may exhibit lighter concentrations due to runoff. Sheltered areas may
            have higher concentrations than exposed areas due to reduced evaporation. Corners and joints are often heavily
            contaminated.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10%): Isolated spots of light-green patina, barely visible. Thickness: <1 µm. 2. Light
            (10-30%): Scattered patches of green, mostly along edges and in crevices. Thickness: 1-5 µm. 3. Moderate (30-60%):
            Significant green coverage, with some areas of bare brass still visible. Thickness: 5-20 µm. 4. Heavy (60-85%):
            Most of the brass surface is covered in green patina, with only small areas of bare metal remaining. Thickness:
            20-100 µm. 5. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, with a thick, crusty layer of patina. Thickness: >100
            µm, potentially reaching millimeters.'
          description: Copper patina/verdigris on brass presents as a visually complex surface alteration, characterized by
            a range of blue-green hues and textures. It typically forms in localized areas or as a thin film across the brass
            surface, often concentrated in areas exposed to moisture and air. The texture can range from smooth and powdery
            to rough and crystalline, depending on the specific chemical composition and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Localized spots around imperfections. 2. Edge accumulation
            along seams and joints. 3. Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4. Patchy/spotty coverage in areas with varying exposure
            to moisture. 5. Streaky/linear patterns caused by water runoff. 6. Localized concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Copper patina/verdigris preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on brass. This
            is due to capillary action, which draws moisture and contaminants to these areas. The edges also tend to have
            a higher surface energy, promoting corrosion. While the center areas can also be affected, the concentration is
            typically lower.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Patina accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture retention. It builds up on flat areas where water can pool. It drips on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity. It collects at edges due to capillary action. It follows contours of the brass surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Patina settles
            on horizontal surfaces, forming thicker layers. Runs down slopes, creating elongated patterns. Hanging from overhead
            surfaces is rare but possible in very humid environments.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh patina can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss due to its fine, crystalline
            structure. As it ages and becomes more matte, the sheen diminishes. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten
            the color and texture. In some cases, particularly with chloride-rich patina, iridescence (rainbow effect) can
            be observed at certain angles.
          texture_details: The texture varies greatly. Initially, it can be a fine, powdery coating, almost velvety to the
            touch. As it thickens, it can become crusty, granular, or even crystalline, with visible micro-crystals under
            magnification. In areas with high humidity, it may feel slightly sticky or damp. Heavily aged patina can be quite
            rough and uneven, with a layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters (mm)
            for heavy, aged buildup. A thin film might be 1-10 µm, while a heavy crust could be 0.5-5 mm thick or even thicker
            in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films covering the brass surface. 2. Thick crusts in areas
            of heavy buildup. 3. Discrete patches or spots. 4. Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 5. Pools/puddles
            of corrosion products in depressions. 6. Crystalline structures visible under magnification. 7. Stains that penetrate
            the brass surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coverage is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface finish, exposure to moisture and air,
            and the presence of contaminants that accelerate or inhibit the corrosion process.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh patina (hours/days) appears as a thin, often translucent film with a bright, almost iridescent
            color. Aged patina (months/years) becomes thicker, more opaque, and darker in color. The texture evolves from
            smooth to rough, and crystalline structures may become more prominent. The patina can also develop a layered appearance
            due to repeated cycles of wetting and drying.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin, almost invisible film at points of
            contact with moisture and pollutants (hours). 2. Spreads outwards from these points, forming small spots and patches
            (days). 3. Accumulates along edges and in crevices due to water runoff (weeks). 4. Thickens and becomes more opaque,
            with crystalline structures forming in areas of heavy buildup (months). 5. Develops a layered appearance due to
            repeated cycles of wetting and drying, with seasonal variations in corrosion rate (years).'
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Bright, almost iridescent turquoise-green. 2. Developing: A mix of light blue-green
            and powdery light green. 3. Mature: Deep, matte forest green with hints of blue-gray. 4. Aged: Dark, almost black-green
            with occasional bright blue highlights in sheltered areas. 5. In chloride-rich environments: A brighter, more
            vibrant blue-green, sometimes approaching a teal.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include localized spots around points of initial
            corrosion, streaks running down vertical surfaces due to water runoff, accumulation in crevices and corners, and
            a general tendency for thicker deposits in areas exposed to moisture and pollutants. Edges and raised details
            often exhibit a higher concentration of patina.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges, in crevices, and on vertical surfaces where
            water can accumulate and run off. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have a more even, but thinner, coating compared
            to sheltered undersides. Corners and areas with poor ventilation often exhibit the highest concentrations. Flat,
            horizontal surfaces can accumulate dust and debris, leading to localized areas of increased corrosion.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10%): Small, isolated spots of light green discoloration. Thickness: <1 µm. 2. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, patchy film of green patina. Thickness: 1-5 µm. 3. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous layer
            of patina, with some areas of heavier buildup. Thickness: 5-20 µm. 4. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, almost complete
            coverage of green patina, with visible crusting in some areas. Thickness: 20-100 µm. 5. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, uneven crust of patina, completely obscuring the original bronze surface. Thickness: >100 µm, potentially
            reaching several millimeters.'
          description: Copper patina/verdigris on bronze presents as a visually complex surface alteration, dominated by shades
            of green and blue, often with textural variations ranging from smooth films to rough, crystalline deposits. The
            coverage pattern is typically uneven, influenced by environmental factors and surface geometry, leading to a mottled
            or streaked appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Edge accumulation: Patina concentrates along edges
            and corners. 2. Point source spreading: Corrosion starts at a specific point and expands outwards. 3. Streaky/linear:
            Vertical streaks due to water runoff. 4. Localized concentrations: Patches of heavy buildup in specific areas.
            5. Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution across the surface. Edge accumulation and streaky patterns are particularly
            common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Copper patina preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to increased exposure to
            moisture and pollutants. The edges act as collection points for water runoff, leading to higher concentrations
            of corrosion products. The center areas may exhibit a thinner, more uniform layer of patina, or remain relatively
            unaffected in the early stages of corrosion. This edge effect is very common.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects the distribution. Patina accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture retention. Flat areas can pool water, leading to more uniform corrosion. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            drip marks. Edges and raised details are often preferentially corroded due to increased exposure to the environment.
            Concave surfaces tend to accumulate more patina than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow of water creates
            vertical streaking and drip marks. Patina tends to pool at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Overhanging
            surfaces may exhibit stalactite-like formations of copper salts in extreme cases. The effect is most pronounced
            in outdoor environments with frequent rainfall.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh patina can exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence. Mature patina typically
            has a matte finish, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. In indoor fluorescent lighting, the green and blue
            hues may appear more muted. The presence of chlorides can lead to a brighter, more reflective surface, even in
            aged patina.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and almost imperceptible films to rough, granular, or crystalline
            deposits. Fresh patina can feel slightly powdery. Aged patina can be hard and crusty, sometimes exhibiting a fine,
            almost velvety texture at a microscopic level. In areas of heavy buildup, the texture can be visibly layered and
            uneven, with distinct ridges and valleys.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A light patina might be 1-10 µm thick, while a heavy crust can reach 1-5 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films: A barely visible layer of patina. 2. Thick crusts:
            Heavy buildup of corrosion products. 3. Drip marks: Streaks of discoloration running down vertical surfaces. 4.
            Discrete patches: Isolated areas of corrosion. 5. Spots/dots: Small, localized points of corrosion. 6. Crystalline
            structures: Microscopic crystals of copper salts. Drip marks and thin films are very common.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The level of uniformity is influenced by factors such as environmental exposure, surface geometry, and
            the presence of localized corrosion initiation sites. Areas sheltered from direct exposure may exhibit less patina
            than exposed areas.
        copper:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, often bright turquoise film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more textured. The color shifts towards deeper blues and greens, and
            the surface may develop a more crystalline or crusty appearance. The patina can also become more resistant to
            removal over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure to moisture and air. It then thickens
            over days and weeks. The process often begins at contact points with other materials or at edges. The patina can
            spread from these initial points, gradually covering the entire surface. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal
            variations in humidity and temperature. Months of exposure lead to a thicker, more established patina.
          color_variations: '1. Freshly formed: Bright, almost iridescent turquoise-green. 2. Developing: A mix of light blue-green
            and slightly chalky green. 3. Mature: Deeper, more muted blue-green, sometimes with hints of gray. 4. Heavily
            aged: Darker, almost black-green in sheltered areas, with lighter blue-green on exposed surfaces. 5. In polluted
            environments: Can exhibit a brownish-green or even a muddy brown due to the incorporation of other pollutants.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coatings on surfaces exposed to consistent moisture and air, localized
            spots or patches where water tends to collect, streaks or drip marks on vertical surfaces, and accumulation in
            crevices and around edges. The distribution is often influenced by the direction of airflow and water runoff.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain may have thinner patina than sheltered undersides. Corners and joints often exhibit
            the heaviest buildup. Vertical walls show drip marks with higher concentration at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces
            collect dust and debris, potentially leading to localized variations in patina formation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or thin films, barely visible discoloration. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage, thin film, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, visible patina layer,
            some original copper still visible. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage, thick patina layer, original copper
            mostly obscured. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, very thick patina layer, significant alteration of the original
            surface.'
          description: Copper patina, or verdigris, on copper surfaces presents as a visually diverse layer of corrosion products.
            It typically exhibits a range of blue-green hues, often with a slightly rough or textured surface, and its distribution
            can vary from uniform coatings to localized patches depending on environmental factors and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, requires very consistent exposure),
            edge accumulation (common due to water pooling), point source spreading (from a leak or spill), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven exposure), streaky/linear
            (from water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around a central corrosion point).'
          edge_center_behavior: Copper patina preferentially accumulates at edges due to water pooling and increased exposure
            to atmospheric pollutants. The center areas of flat surfaces may have thinner patina due to better drainage and
            less accumulation of moisture. This edge effect is a common characteristic of copper corrosion.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Patina accumulates in corners and builds
            up in crevices due to water retention. It pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, and collects at edges
            due to surface tension. It follows contours and can bridge small gaps. Depressions fill with water and debris,
            accelerating corrosion in those areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker patina.
            Runs down slopes create visible trails. Overhanging surfaces can develop hanging formations of corrosion products.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the patina can exhibit a slight sheen, especially when freshly formed.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the colors and reduce the sheen. In some cases, particularly with
            thin films, iridescence or rainbow effects can be observed due to light interference within the layers of corrosion
            products. Matte finish is more common with thicker, aged patina.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth and almost powdery when freshly formed to rough and slightly
            crystalline as it ages. Heavier buildup can feel crusty or even slightly sticky, particularly in humid conditions.
            Close inspection may reveal fine granular structures or layered formations.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters (mm)
            for heavy, aged buildup. A typical mature patina might be 50-500 µm thick. Extreme cases can reach 1-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from water flow),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (early stages), thick crusts (advanced corrosion), discrete patches
            (localized corrosion), spots/dots (initial corrosion points), stains (discoloration without significant buildup),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (at edges and crevices), and crystalline structures (under specific humidity
            conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It's typically moderately patchy to highly
            variable/irregular. Uniformity depends on the consistency of environmental exposure. Sheltered areas may have
            thicker, darker patina, while exposed areas might have thinner, lighter patina due to weathering.

      thickness: thin film to thick accumulation
    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_materials:
        abs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly bound to the ABS surface, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions
            and the incorporation of oils and other contaminants. The texture can become more crusty and difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Dust buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Accumulation begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward over days. Layering effects become visible over weeks and months, with seasonal variations in dust
            composition and deposition rates. The dust thickens over time, becoming more difficult to remove.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) with hints of gray. Aged dust (days): Tan (#D2B48C) with subtle
            reddish undertones. Aged dust (weeks): Light brown (#A68B64) with rust-orange (#B7410E) edges where moisture has
            been present. Heavily soiled: Dark brown (#654321) with possible black soot deposits (#000000).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. On horizontal surfaces, a more uniform coating is common. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks or
            drip marks, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and recessed areas act as traps for
            dust particles. Top surfaces of horizontal objects receive more direct deposition than undersides. Sheltered areas
            accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy film, slightly alters surface appearance, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating, obscures original surface color, thickness 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significantly
            alters surface appearance, thickness 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, original surface barely visible,
            thick crusty buildup, thickness > 50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on ABS typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. Coverage varies from
            sparse speckling to a complete coating, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along raised features, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, and streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. The center areas tend to have a more uniform,
            but often thinner, coating. This behavior is driven by the increased surface area and electrostatic charge concentration
            at edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow
            patterns. Crevices act as traps, preventing dust from being easily removed. Flat areas allow for more uniform
            deposition. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate
            along them. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven water runoff. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust, with thicker accumulation at the bottom. Overhead
            surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a slightly lighter shade compared to natural light. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oily contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x),
            individual particles of varying sizes are visible. Depending on humidity, it can become slightly sticky or form
            a thin crust. Grain size varies from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly dusted areas to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm in areas of significant accumulation. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of up to 1 mm in sheltered areas
            with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            caused by water runoff, discrete patches around point sources, spots/dots from individual particles, stains from
            absorbed liquids, and buildups in crevices and corners. Thick crusts can form in areas with repeated wetting and
            drying cycles.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Horizontal surfaces tend to have mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations. Vertical surfaces are typically moderately patchy or highly variable/irregular due to gravity
            and airflow. Edges and crevices are often concentrated areas. The uniformity level is primarily affected by airflow,
            surface orientation, and the presence of moisture.
        acrylic (pmma):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly adhered, darker in color (due to oxidation and chemical reactions), and
            potentially thicker. It may also exhibit signs of biological growth (mold, algae) in humid environments, adding
            green or black discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., corners) and spreads outward. Accumulation can be uniform or concentrated in specific areas depending
            on environmental factors. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates. Significant buildup can occur within weeks to months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted brownish-gray
            (#848482) to a reddish-brown in areas with higher iron oxide content (#A0522D). Areas with organic matter may
            exhibit a yellowish-brown tint (#B8860B). Soot presence shifts the color towards darker grays (#4F4F4F).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include a general coating with heavier accumulation in corners, crevices, and along
            edges. Streaks and drip marks are often observed on vertical surfaces due to gravity and rain. Horizontal surfaces
            tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Electrostatic attraction can cause localized spotty patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Crevices and
            sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom
            due to gravity and rain.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, patchy film is visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that obscures
            the underlying surface slightly. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that significantly
            obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely
            obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on acrylic (PMMA) typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a
            dominant color range from light tan to brownish-gray. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by electrostatic
            charge and surface geometry, leading to variations in thickness and concentration. It tends to mute the underlying
            acrylic's clarity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to electrostatic effects), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic charge and airflow
            patterns. The mechanism is the concentration of electric field lines at edges and the tendency of airflow to deposit
            particles at boundaries.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to electrostatic
            charge and airflow patterns. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are also observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The presence of soot can create a slight darkening effect,
            reducing reflectivity. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At a microscopic level, individual
            particles of varying sizes are visible, creating a slightly rough surface. Depending on humidity, it can become
            slightly sticky or crusty, especially if organic matter is present. It lacks crystalline structure.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to 50-200 μm for heavy buildup.
            In extreme cases, particularly in sheltered areas, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial stage), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to water), discrete patches (due to electrostatic charge), spots/dots (individual particles),
            stains (from organic matter), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in sheltered areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, electrostatic charge, surface geometry,
            and the nature of the dust source.
        alabaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more deeply embedded, darker in color (shifting towards reddish-brown or gray), and more
            difficult to remove. The dust layer thickens over time, potentially forming a hardened crust in some areas.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward (weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than localized
            buildup. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A07A55), Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich areas: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E), Pollen-dominant areas: Yellowish-Tan (#E2D1B3)'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with heavier accumulation in recessed areas, along edges,
            and on horizontal surfaces. Streaks and drip marks are observed on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or
            condensation. Localized spots can occur due to point sources of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices compared to the center of flat
            surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and sheltered areas also
            exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient with higher concentration at the bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film, slight color change, 10-30 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, visible texture, 30-100 μm thickness.
            Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significant color change, 100-200 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup,
            obscures original surface, >200 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on alabaster presents as a fine, matte layer, typically ranging from light tan to
            reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating subtle shading variations across
            the surface. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to localized concentrations depending on exposure and airflow.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (very common),
            point source spreading (common near vents or windows), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (common in sheltered areas), streaky/linear (common on vertical surfaces due to water runoff), localized
            concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. The edges act as barriers, trapping airborne particles. This creates a darker outline around
            the perimeter of the alabaster object.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational
            settling. Flat areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            Edges act as collection points, creating a visible outline of dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed
            after rain. Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the lack of adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the color variations and texture. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow effect. The dust
            layer reduces the overall reflectivity of the alabaster surface.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch. At higher
            magnification (100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. In areas with moisture, the
            dust can become slightly sticky or form a thin, hardened crust.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            in crevices can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete patches (in
            sheltered areas), spots/dots (from airborne particles), stains (where dust has reacted with the alabaster surface),
            buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, surface geometry, and the presence of localized
            contamination sources.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (shifting towards reddish-brown or gray), and more
            difficult to remove. The thickness increases, and the texture can become crustier due to chemical reactions with
            the alumina surface and atmospheric components.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens over days, with preferential
            accumulation at contact points and edges. Over weeks, the dust spreads inward from the edges. Uniform gradual
            accumulation is possible in controlled environments. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects
            occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup (visible to the naked
            eye) typically occurs within days to weeks, depending on the environment.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A07A55), Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich dust: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-Tan (#E8D58D).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Initial deposition
            often appears as a thin, uniform film, which then thickens in areas of low airflow or high particle impaction.
            Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices compared to the center of
            flat surfaces. Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to settling. Corners and sheltered
            areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, patchy film is visible. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer covers a significant
            portion of the surface. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, continuous layer obscures the underlying
            material. Thickness: 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, consolidated layer completely covers the surface.
            Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on alumina typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan to reddish-brown.
            The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, often exhibiting a slightly granular or powdery texture.
            Coverage varies significantly depending on exposure and cleaning frequency.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), point source spreading
            (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due
            to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and rain), localized concentrations (in
            crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Edges act as barriers, trapping particles. The center areas tend to have lower concentrations due
            to higher airflow and less particle impaction.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and particle trapping. It builds
            up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust particles.
            The dust layer tends to follow contours and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the relatively low adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the color variations, making reddish-brown or gray patches more prominent. Soot-rich areas
            may exhibit a slight sheen due to the carbon content.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, with individual particles ranging from 1-50
            μm. It feels slightly gritty to the touch. In humid environments, it can become slightly sticky or crusty due
            to moisture absorption. Under high magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen,
            angular mineral fragments, fibrous organic matter) are visible.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm in heavily contaminated areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity), discrete patches (due
            to localized sources), spots/dots (from individual particle impacts), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform
            coatings (rare, only in controlled environments), buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, and the location of dust sources.
            Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        aluminosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, light-colored film, easily removed. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Darker, more consolidated layer, harder to remove, may exhibit staining of the glass surface,
            increased thickness, and potential for chemical bonding with the glass surface.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and corners. Over time, the film
            thickens and spreads inward. Point sources of contamination (e.g., nearby machinery) can create localized areas
            of heavy buildup that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates. This process can take days to months to years depending on the environment.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Yellowish-brown (#967969), Rust-tinged
            areas (#B7410E) due to iron oxide, Dark gray/black spots (#36454F) from soot, Whitish patches (#F5F5DC) from calcium
            carbonate.'
          common_patterns: Accumulates more readily on horizontal surfaces due to settling. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks
            and drip marks from water runoff carrying dust. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. Crevices and surface defects act as collection points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to have higher concentrations than the center of a flat surface. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas exposed to direct airflow may have less dust than sheltered areas. Bottom edges of vertical surfaces may
            exhibit concentrated drip marks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Light (10-30%): A thin, translucent
            film. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the glass slightly. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer,
            significantly reducing transparency. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer, potentially several hundred
            micrometers thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on aluminosilicate glass typically appears as a light tan to brownish-gray film,
            often with localized darker spots due to soot or organic matter. The texture ranges from fine and powdery to slightly
            gritty, depending on the particle size and composition of the dust. Coverage patterns vary from uniform coatings
            to localized accumulations, influenced by surface orientation and airflow.
          distribution_patterns: 'Most common patterns are: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Streaky/linear patterns
            on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 3) Edge accumulation due to electrostatic effects. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution in areas with uneven airflow or surface contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic charge and airflow
            patterns. The perimeter of a glass surface often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the center.
            This effect is more pronounced on larger surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Pools
            on flat areas, especially if moisture is present. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges
            due to electrostatic charge. Follows contours of the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Settling on horizontal
            surfaces is the primary mechanism for dust accumulation.
          lighting_effects: 'Direct sunlight: Reveals the texture and color variations more clearly, may show a slight sheen
            on areas with organic binder. Indoor fluorescent: Appears more uniform and muted in color. Matte finish overall,
            unless moisture is present, which can create a temporary gloss.'
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual particles
            are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface is generally matte, with occasional
            crystalline structures (calcium carbonate) visible under higher magnification (100x+). Can become sticky if exposed
            to moisture or condensation.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-50 μm. Heavy buildup: 50-200 μm, potentially exceeding
            200 μm in sheltered areas or after prolonged exposure.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces. 3) Discrete patches and spots/dots from localized sources. 4) Buildups in corners and crevices.
            5) Stains on the glass surface after prolonged exposure to moisture.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is influenced by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the
            presence of moisture or other contaminants.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted, adheres more strongly to the surface, and may exhibit color changes due
            to oxidation of metallic components (e.g., iron). Thickness increases over time, and the texture can transition
            from powdery to slightly crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly on the surface. Over
            time, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Accumulation begins at contact points and edges,
            then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward,
            creating circular or radial patterns. Layering effects can be observed, especially in areas with seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates. Timeframes range from hours for initial deposition to months/years for
            significant buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to grayish-white (#F0F0F0). Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C), Light
            Brown (#A68A64), and Rust-tinged Brown (#B87333) where iron oxides are present. Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9)
            to Black (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-gray (#CBC8B1).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially along edges, in corners, and within surface imperfections. On vertical
            surfaces, gravity causes streaks and drip marks. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
            Wind direction and prevailing weather patterns influence the overall distribution, creating directional patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in corners due to airflow patterns and
            electrostatic attraction. Top surfaces of horizontal elements accumulate more dust than undersides. Sheltered
            areas and crevices trap dust, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top
            to bottom due to gravity-induced runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            layer, slightly alters surface appearance, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures original
            surface color, 15-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily disturbed layer, significantly alters surface appearance,
            50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, compacted layer, almost completely obscures original surface, >100
            μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on aluminum typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light gray to
            brownish-gray, often with localized variations in color and thickness. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices
            and along edges, creating visible patterns and gradients. Over time, the layer can become more compacted and develop
            a slightly crusty texture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along perimeter features. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water
            runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with uneven surface roughness or localized sources of contamination.
            5) Gradient from source, decreasing concentration with distance from a dust source (e.g., a road or construction
            site).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. While the center areas also accumulate dust, the
            concentration is typically lower than at the edges. This creates a visible contrast between the clean center and
            the dusty perimeter.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges
            act as barriers, trapping dust and creating visible lines of accumulation. Depressions and pits fill with dust
            over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer. Pooling occurs at
            bottom edges, where dust accumulates due to runoff. Runs down slopes are common, especially after rain events.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses light, reducing the reflectivity
            of the aluminum. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the granular texture.
            No significant sheen or iridescence is typically observed, unless specific contaminants (e.g., certain metallic
            particles) are present.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine to the touch. With moisture and time, it can become
            slightly sticky or crusty, especially in areas with higher concentrations of organic matter or calcium carbonate.
            Close inspection reveals a granular texture, with individual particles ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of
            micrometers in size. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss or sheen.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to 50-200 μm or
            more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of 1-2 mm, especially
            in sheltered areas or crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces. 3) Discrete patches and spots/dots where dust particles initially land. 4) Buildups in corners
            and crevices. 5) Stains caused by dissolved contaminants in rainwater. 6) Thick crusts in areas with repeated
            wetting and drying cycles.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in surface roughness, airflow patterns, and the presence of localized contamination
            sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        aluminum bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more consolidated, and harder to remove. The color shifts towards deeper browns
            and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases over time, and the texture becomes more crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads outward. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur
            due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Significant buildup (visible to the naked
            eye) typically takes weeks to months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E8DAB2), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray
            (#36454F), Iron-rich areas: Rust-Orange (#B7410E), Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Tan (#FAF0BE).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces, and localized accumulation in crevices and around fasteners. Edges and corners tend to collect more
            dust due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit
            higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and light dusting, barely visible, <10 μm thickness. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy film, slightly obscuring the underlying metal, 10-50 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            layer, partially obscuring the metal''s original color, 50-200 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup,
            largely obscuring the metal, 200-400 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick, consolidated layer, almost completely
            obscuring the metal, >400 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on aluminum bronze typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a
            dominant color range from light tan to reddish-brown. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to near-complete obscuration
            of the underlying metal, depending on exposure and cleaning frequency. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices
            and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (perimeter of panels), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance from a dust source), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to rain or wind), localized
            concentrations (in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter of panels often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on larger, flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as
            collection points. Depressions and indentations fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs down the
            incline. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Soot-rich areas may appear slightly darker and less reflective.
            No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine, powdery (like talc) to slightly gritty, depending on the particle
            size distribution. It feels dry to the touch unless exposed to moisture, in which case it can become slightly
            sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of fine particles and occasional larger debris.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with prolonged exposure and moisture), discrete patches
            (due to localized dust sources), spots/dots (individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due to variations in surface orientation, airflow, and dust sources. Uniformity
            is higher on horizontal surfaces and lower on complex geometries.
        aluminum nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable layer. Over time (weeks/months), the dust
            can become more compacted and adhered, especially in humid environments. Color may darken due to chemical reactions
            (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases with continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and contact points. Over days, the
            film thickens and spreads. Point sources expand outward, creating localized patches. Layering effects can occur
            due to intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates are common.
            Significant buildup can occur within weeks to months, depending on the environment.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust (dry): Medium brown (#8B4513) with reddish
            undertones due to iron oxide. Aged dust (humid): Dark brown (#654321) with possible greenish tinge from algae/mold.
            Dust with high soot content: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Dust with high calcium carbonate content: Off-white
            to light gray (#F5F5DC).'
          common_patterns: Distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas and around edges. Streaking
            can occur on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more
            uniform layer. Crevices and surface defects act as collection points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling.
            Sheltered areas (e.g., undersides of components) can accumulate significantly more dust than exposed areas. Top
            surfaces may have less dust due to rain washing.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy layer. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coverage, obscuring some surface details. Thickness:
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant obscuration of the underlying surface. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Near-complete coverage, forming a thick layer. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Aluminum Nitride typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a dominant
            grayish-brown hue. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly crusty depending on humidity and the presence of
            organic binders. Coverage varies significantly, from sparse speckling to near-complete obscuration of the underlying
            AlN surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            due to electrostatic forces and airflow patterns, point source spreading from localized contamination events (e.g.,
            a spill), streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, and patchy/spotty distribution in
            areas with uneven surface roughness.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow
            patterns. The perimeter often has a higher concentration than the center areas. This is especially noticeable
            on flat, rectangular components.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points, creating a visible outline of the component.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on
            vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Runs down slopes are common, creating
            streaks. Dust does not typically hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. The presence of oily or organic contaminants
            can create a slight sheen. No significant iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is powdery and easily disturbed. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky
            or crusty, forming a weakly adhered layer. Under magnification, individual particles of varying sizes and shapes
            are visible, including angular mineral fragments, spherical pollen grains, and irregular soot aggregates. The
            surface feels rough to the touch, especially with heavier accumulations.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for light dust to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) or even a millimeter (1 mm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, thick crusts in areas with repeated
            wetting and drying, drip marks on vertical surfaces, discrete patches where dust has been deposited and adhered,
            and stains caused by dissolved contaminants. No crystalline structures are expected from typical environmental
            dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by airflow patterns, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and
            the nature of the dust source.
        ash:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, uniform coating. Aged contamination (months/years
            old) becomes darker, more consolidated, and potentially thicker. Color shifts towards darker grays and browns
            due to the accumulation of organic matter and soot. The texture can transition from powdery to crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points or edges. It then spreads
            outward, gradually covering the entire surface. Uniform gradual accumulation is common in sheltered environments.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust
            composition and deposition rates. This process can take hours for initial deposition, days for noticeable coverage,
            and months for significant buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle beige undertones (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D) to a darker, sooty gray (#4A4A4A) where carbon black is prevalent. Dust with high
            iron content: Exhibits rust-orange hues (#B7410E). Pollen-rich dust: Can have a yellowish-green tint (#9ACD32).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. It also collects in crevices, corners,
            and other sheltered areas where airflow is reduced. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces, especially
            after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and corners often accumulate more dust due to electrostatic attraction and reduced airflow. Vertical walls typically
            have lighter concentrations, except where drip marks or streaks are present. Crevices and depressions act as traps
            for dust particles.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A barely visible dusting, with individual particles scattered across the
            surface (thickness < 1 μm). Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer that partially obscures the underlying surface
            (thickness 1-5 μm). Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous layer that obscures most of the underlying surface, but
            the original texture is still visible (thickness 5-25 μm). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that completely
            obscures the underlying surface and texture (thickness 25-100 μm). Extreme (>85%): A very thick buildup that forms
            a distinct crust or layer, potentially altering the original shape of the object (thickness >100 μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on ash typically presents as a fine, powdery layer with a muted, earthy tone. The
            color and texture vary depending on the composition of the dust and the age of the deposit, ranging from light
            gray to reddish-brown. Coverage can be uniform or patchy, often accumulating in crevices and on horizontal surfaces.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered environments), edge
            accumulation (due to electrostatic effects or airflow patterns), point source spreading (around vents or openings),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface conditions),
            and streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust often preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and airflow patterns. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is particularly noticeable
            on flat surfaces and around the perimeter of objects.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It pools on flat areas due to gravity. On vertical surfaces, it drips and runs downwards. Edges tend to collect
            dust due to electrostatic effects. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces, creating a thicker layer over time. Runs down slopes are also observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically has a matte finish, with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the variations in color and texture. Soot-rich dust may appear slightly more
            absorbent of light, resulting in a darker, less reflective surface.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is powdery and fine, feeling soft to the touch. Over time, moisture and chemical
            reactions can cause it to become slightly crusty or sticky, especially if organic matter is present. At high magnification,
            individual particles of SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ may be visible as angular grains.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm or even 1-2 mm in sheltered areas over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting
            and drying), discrete patches (due to localized sources), spots/dots (individual particle deposition), stains
            (from dissolved contaminants), and uniform coatings (in sheltered environments).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. In controlled indoor environments, the distribution can
            be mostly uniform with minor variations. Outdoors, the distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular
            due to wind, rain, and other environmental factors. Concentration is often concentrated in specific areas, such
            as crevices and sheltered surfaces.
        bamboo:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Light, powdery, easily disturbed. Color is typically a light
            tan or grey. Aged contamination (months/years): Darker, more consolidated, and harder to remove. Color shifts
            towards reddish-brown or dark brown. The texture becomes more crusty and may exhibit signs of biological growth
            (mold, algae) in humid environments.'
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film of dust that uniformly coats the surface. Over time, dust
            accumulates at contact points and edges, creating localized concentrations. The dust then spreads inward from
            the edges, gradually covering the entire surface. Layering effects occur as new dust deposits on top of older
            layers. Seasonal variations in dust levels can lead to distinct layers with different colors and textures. The
            timeframe for significant buildup can range from days (in heavily polluted environments) to months (in cleaner
            environments).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E9DBC7) with subtle grey undertones. Aged dust (dry): Munsell 5YR 4/4
            (moderate reddish brown). Aged dust (humid): Darker, more saturated reddish-brown (#8B4513) with possible black
            soot inclusions (#000000). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#F0E68C). Dust mixed with rainwater runoff: Streaks
            of dark brown (#4A3020).'
          common_patterns: The dust tends to accumulate in the grooves and ridges of the bamboo's surface. Streaks and drip
            marks are common on vertical surfaces, especially after rain. Horizontal surfaces exhibit a more uniform coating,
            often thicker than on vertical surfaces. Edges and corners tend to have the heaviest accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to have higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Crevices
            and grooves accumulate more dust than smooth surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to direct deposition have higher concentrations
            than sheltered undersides. The bottom edges of vertical surfaces may exhibit increased concentration due to runoff
            accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy coating. Bamboo surface is still clearly visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating,
            obscuring some of the bamboo''s texture. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring most of the bamboo''s
            texture. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer. Bamboo surface is barely visible. Thickness:
            >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on bamboo presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by earthy tones
            ranging from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture varies from a fine, powdery coating to a slightly crusty
            or granular surface, depending on humidity and the age of the deposit. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with
            accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along the bamboo''s nodes and edges, point source spreading from areas where dust is introduced (e.g., near a
            road), gradient from source with decreasing concentration further away, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven
            airflow or surface irregularities, and streaky/linear patterns caused by rainwater runoff. Edge accumulation and
            uniform coating on horizontal surfaces are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges of the bamboo stalks and the edges of any cut surfaces tend to have the highest concentration
            of dust. While the center areas of flat surfaces also accumulate dust, the concentration is typically lower than
            at the edges. This is due to the edges acting as a barrier, trapping dust particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act
            as collection points, leading to thicker buildup. The dust follows the contours of the bamboo's surface, accentuating
            its natural texture. Depressions and grooves fill with dust, creating a darker appearance.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust,
            especially after rain. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but less so than horizontal surfaces. The angle
            of the surface directly affects the rate of dust accumulation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. The color is more vibrant
            and the texture is more pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the dust appears duller and the color is
            less saturated. Soot particles can create a slight sheen in heavily contaminated areas. No iridescence is typically
            observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine, like talc. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky
            or clay-like. Over time, especially in humid environments, it can harden into a thin, brittle crust. Close inspection
            reveals a granular texture with occasional larger particles of organic matter or soot. The bamboo's natural grain
            remains visible through thinner dust layers.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, especially
            in sheltered areas, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by rainwater, discrete patches where dust has settled, and
            stains where dust has been dissolved and redeposited by moisture. No crystalline structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. While horizontal surfaces may exhibit a
            relatively uniform coating, vertical surfaces and areas around nodes tend to have more uneven distribution. The
            level of uniformity is influenced by airflow patterns, surface roughness, and the frequency of cleaning or rainfall.
        basalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adhered to the basalt surface, often exhibiting color changes due
            to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). The dust layer may also thicken and become more difficult to
            remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film deposited by wind and rain (hours/days). It then thickens over
            time, especially in sheltered areas (weeks/months). Accumulation begins at contact points (edges, crevices) and
            spreads outward. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; point sources and edge accumulation are more common.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C) with subtle gray undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2723) in areas with higher organic content. Areas with significant
            iron oxide may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Soot-rich areas can appear dark gray to black (#434A54).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges, in cracks and fissures, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces often exhibit streaks due to rainwater runoff. Areas sheltered from wind and rain tend to have thicker,
            more uniform dust layers.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier in crevices, corners, and sheltered areas. Edges and
            raised features often exhibit higher concentrations due to wind deposition. Vertical surfaces typically have lower
            concentrations overall, except for areas with drip marks. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, primarily in micro-crevices, thickness < 1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, slightly altering the basalt''s color, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Noticeable dust layer, partially obscuring the original surface, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant
            dust buildup, largely obscuring the original surface, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, continuous dust
            layer, completely obscuring the original surface, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on basalt typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, often
            forming streaks or localized patches, especially on weathered surfaces.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on sheltered horizontal surfaces,
            edge accumulation along raised features, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird
            droppings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution on irregular
            surfaces, and streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to wind deposition and reduced water runoff in these areas. Flat, exposed center areas tend to have thinner, more
            easily removed dust layers.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water runoff. Flat areas
            tend to pool dust. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points for windblown
            dust. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of airborne dust. Slopes exhibit runs and
            streaks. Overhead surfaces may accumulate hanging dust, although this is less common on basalt due to its typically
            outdoor exposure.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the variations in color and texture. Wet dust may exhibit a slight sheen. Soot particles
            can create a dull, light-absorbing effect.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry, becoming slightly sticky or muddy when
            wet. Under magnification (100x), individual particles appear angular and irregular. In areas with high calcium
            carbonate content, a slightly crusty or chalky texture may develop over time.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in exposed areas to a heavier buildup of 50-200
            μm in sheltered areas and crevices. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in deep crevices or on horizontal
            surfaces protected from rain.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by rainwater,
            thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in areas with high calcium carbonate, discrete patches where dust
            has accumulated, stains from organic matter decomposition, and uniform coatings on sheltered horizontal areas.
            No crystalline structures are expected.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by surface roughness, wind exposure, and rainwater runoff. Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to have
            the most uniform coverage, while exposed vertical surfaces are the least uniform.
        beech:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer with a powdery
            texture and light tan color. Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes more compacted, darker in color (reddish-brown
            to dark brown), and more difficult to remove. The dust layer may develop a slightly crusty surface due to moisture
            and organic matter binding the particles together.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours) that gradually thickens over time (days/weeks). Initial
            deposition often occurs at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible
            in controlled environments, but more often, point sources expand outward, creating patchy coverage. Layering effects
            can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DDC7) with slight grey undertones. Aged dust (days): Yellowish-brown
            (#C19A6B) with hints of orange. Aged dust (weeks): Reddish-brown (#A0785A) with darker brown (#6B4F4F) in crevices.
            Heavily soiled: Dark brown (#4E342E) with possible black (#000000) soot deposits.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Initial deposition
            often appears as a light, uniform coating, but over time, gravity and airflow create streaks and drip marks on
            vertical surfaces. Areas sheltered from wind and rain tend to accumulate thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to the environment accumulate more
            dust than undersides. Corners and joints are prime accumulation points. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from
            top to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            coating, wood grain still visible, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, partially obscuring wood
            grain, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, wood grain largely obscured, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, obscuring all underlying detail, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on beech typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform
            coating that obscures the underlying wood grain to varying degrees depending on the dust layer thickness.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (initial deposition), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic forces and airflow), point source spreading (from nearby machinery or vents), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition due to surface irregularities),
            streaky/linear (due to water runoff or wind). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as a barrier, trapping dust particles carried by air currents. The center areas
            tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, filling depressions and obscuring fine details. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer.
            Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. The dust layer
            follows the contours of the wood surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            occur down slopes. Overhead surfaces tend to accumulate less dust than upward-facing surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to emphasize the yellowish tones in the dust. In oblique lighting, surface irregularities and particle
            texture become more apparent. Soot particles can create a slight sheen in heavily contaminated areas.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly gritty and compacted
            with age. It feels dry to the touch. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of fine particles. Under
            magnification (100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral
            fragments and rounded organic particles.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 100-500
            μm or more in sheltered areas. Extreme cases in industrial settings can reach 1-2 mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water or
            condensation), thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high humidity and organic matter),
            discrete patches (due to localized sources), spots/dots (from individual particles settling), stains (where dust
            has dissolved and penetrated the wood), uniform coatings (initial deposition), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface roughness, airflow patterns, and the proximity of dust
            sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        beryllium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more adhered to the surface, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions (e.g.,
            oxidation). The dust layer can also thicken and become more consolidated over time, forming a harder, more resistant
            crust.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often barely visible. It begins at contact points and edges,
            then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward.
            Layering effects occur with repeated dust deposition events. Seasonal variations in dust concentration can lead
            to distinct layers. Timeframe: Hours - initial settling; Days - noticeable film; Weeks - visible accumulation;
            Months - significant buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DDC7) to pale yellow-gray (#D3D3D3). Aged dust (weeks): Light reddish-brown
            (#A0785A) due to oxidation of iron. Heavily contaminated: Darker reddish-brown (#804A00) with possible black soot
            deposits (#000000). Areas with moisture exposure: May exhibit darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2723) staining.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer, while vertical surfaces may exhibit streaks
            or drip marks from moisture. Crevices and surface imperfections act as traps for dust particles.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Horizontal surfaces collect more dust than vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate
            more dust than exposed areas. Crevices and surface imperfections act as traps for dust particles, leading to higher
            concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, easily disturbed layer. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that obscures the underlying
            surface. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily visible layer that significantly alters the surface
            appearance. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, consolidated layer that completely obscures the
            underlying surface. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on beryllium typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating
            in crevices and along edges, creating a slightly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along perimeters, point source spreading from localized contamination events, streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity and moisture, patchy/spotty distribution in areas with uneven airflow, and localized concentrations
            in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The perimeter of a beryllium component often shows a higher concentration of dust compared to
            the central areas. This effect is more pronounced on components with sharp edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. Flat areas allow for more uniform settling. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions and pits trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead
            surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs precariously before falling.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and texture. Depending on the composition, some particles may exhibit
            a slight sheen or sparkle, particularly if they contain reflective minerals like mica.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become more compacted and crusty, especially if exposed to moisture. Microscopic
            examination reveals a mixture of irregular particle shapes and sizes.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of
            1-2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools/puddles
            in depressions, thick crusts in areas with repeated wetting and drying, discrete patches where dust has settled,
            stains from dissolved contaminants, and buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the location
            of dust sources. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered environments tend to be more uniform than vertical or exposed
            surfaces.
        birch:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and may adhere more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to chemical
            reactions (oxidation, hydration) and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time, potentially
            leading to a visible crust.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles. Over time, the film thickens as
            more particles deposit. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources (e.g., vents) create expanding
            circular patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Timeframe: noticeable film within days, significant buildup within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust: Darker, slightly reddish-brown (#80756A)
            due to iron oxide oxidation. Soot-rich dust: Dark gray to almost black (#333333). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-brown
            (#C1B38B). Calcium Carbonate rich dust: Off-white to light gray (#E8E4D9).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, such as knots, bark fissures, and saw marks.
            On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common due to gravity and rain. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer. Edges and corners often exhibit a higher concentration of dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and recessed areas act as traps for
            dust particles, leading to higher concentrations. Top surfaces of horizontal elements exposed to the environment
            will have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, slight dulling of the surface. Thickness: <10 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Noticeable film, some obscuring of the wood grain. Thickness: 10-30 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            obscuring of the wood grain, visible dust layer. Thickness: 30-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, noticeable dust
            layer, significant obscuring of the wood grain. Thickness: 100-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty dust
            layer, almost complete obscuring of the wood grain. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on birch presents as a fine, particulate layer that dulls the underlying wood grain.
            The color is typically a muted grayish-brown, with variations depending on the local environment and dust composition.
            Coverage ranges from a barely perceptible film to a noticeable coating, often accumulating in crevices and along
            edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (along edges and corners), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance from a dust source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture
            or airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to airflow patterns
            and electrostatic attraction. The edges disrupt airflow, causing dust particles to deposit more readily. Center
            areas tend to have lower concentrations, especially on vertical surfaces where gravity pulls dust downwards.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. Crevices and
            recessed areas act as traps for dust particles. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces
            experience drip marks and streaking. Edges and contours disrupt airflow, leading to increased dust deposition.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles on vertical and inclined surfaces, resulting in
            drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a layer that thickens over time.
            Pooling of dust can occur at bottom edges and in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses light, reducing the wood's natural
            sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the grayish tones of the dust. No significant iridescence or
            rainbow effects are typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine, feeling slightly gritty to the touch due to the presence
            of silica and other mineral particles. At higher magnifications (100x+), individual particles of varying shapes
            and sizes are visible. The dust layer is typically non-adherent and easily disturbed.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, such
            as sheltered areas with minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            with heavy buildup and moisture), discrete patches (due to localized contamination sources), spots/dots (due to
            individual dust particles or water droplets), stains (caused by dissolved contaminants), drip marks (on vertical
            surfaces), runs/streaks (on inclined surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on the environment. On sheltered horizontal surfaces,
            the distribution can be mostly uniform with minor variations. On exposed vertical surfaces, the distribution is
            typically highly variable/irregular due to wind and rain. Crevices and edges tend to have higher concentrations,
            leading to non-uniformity.
        bismuth:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color, and more difficult to remove. The thickness increases,
            and the dust may become slightly cemented to the surface, forming a thin crust.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles deposited randomly on the surface
            (hours). Over days, the film thickens and becomes more uniform, with preferential accumulation at edges and in
            crevices. After weeks/months, the dust layer consolidates, darkens in color, and may form a crusty layer. Seasonal
            variations in humidity and dust concentration can lead to layering effects, with distinct layers of different
            colors and textures.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to pale yellow (#FFFFE0). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) to a darker, slightly greyish brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide and soot accumulation. Areas with organic
            matter may exhibit a greenish-brown tint (#808000). Soot-rich areas will appear dark grey (#A9A9A9) to black (#000000).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in recessed areas, along edges, and in any surface imperfections.
            On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common due to gravity. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform
            coverage, but with variations based on airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat areas. Crevices and recessed areas exhibit the highest concentrations.
            Top surfaces exposed to airflow may have less dust than sheltered bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film, slightly altering the surface color, thickness 1-10 μm.
            Moderate (30-60%): A more noticeable layer, obscuring the original surface texture, thickness 10-100 μm. Heavy
            (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer, significantly altering the surface appearance, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the original surface, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on bismuth typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often highlighting surface imperfections and edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in low-airflow
            environments), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns), point source spreading
            (around localized contamination sources), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff),
            patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition and surface irregularities).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by air currents. The center areas
            tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points, creating a visible outline of the object.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges, where dust accumulates due to
            gravity and surface tension of any moisture present.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Areas with higher organic content may show a slight sheen
            when viewed at a grazing angle. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it easily disperses.
            With higher humidity, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under magnification (50x-100x), individual particles
            of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral fragments and rounded organic particles.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, particularly
            in sheltered areas, buildup can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), drip marks (on vertical
            surfaces), discrete patches (in areas with localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual dust particles),
            stains (from organic matter or dissolved minerals), buildups (in sheltered areas and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of surface imperfections.
        bluestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more tightly bound to the bluestone surface due to chemical bonding and compaction. The color darkens
            as iron oxides oxidize further, and the texture can become slightly crusty due to the precipitation of dissolved
            minerals.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads outward. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly than flat surfaces. Over months, the
            dust layer thickens and becomes more tightly bound to the bluestone surface. Seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DDC7) with a slight grey tint. Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0785A) due
            to oxidation of iron. Soot-rich areas: Dark grey (#4A4A4A). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#F0E68C). Areas
            with calcium carbonate: Off-white (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, along edges, and in any surface imperfections.
            On vertical surfaces, gravity causes streaking and drip marks. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer of dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher in recessed areas, along edges, and at the bottom of
            vertical surfaces due to gravity. Exposed areas, such as the center of flat surfaces, tend to have lower concentrations
            due to wind and rain erosion. Corners and crevices act as dust traps, leading to significant buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Light (10-30%): A thin film, slightly
            obscuring the bluestone surface. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the bluestone texture. Heavy
            (60-85%): A thick layer, completely obscuring the bluestone surface. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer
            with significant buildup.'
          description: Environmental dust on bluestone typically presents as a matte, slightly granular coating, ranging in
            color from light tan to reddish-brown depending on the iron oxide content and age. The dust tends to accumulate
            in crevices and along edges, creating a subtle contrast with the underlying bluestone.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along borders, point source spreading from bird droppings or other localized sources, streaky/linear patterns
            on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff, and patchy/spotty distribution in areas exposed to wind and rain.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in recessed areas. This is due
            to reduced airflow and increased surface area for particle impaction. The center of flat surfaces tends to have
            lower dust concentrations due to wind and rain erosion.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry strongly influences dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer of dust.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to accentuate the grey tones in the dust. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed
            unless there is oil contamination present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At a microscopic level, individual
            dust particles are visible, ranging from smooth, rounded grains of silica to irregular, angular fragments of minerals.
            The presence of organic matter can impart a slightly sticky or greasy feel, especially in humid conditions.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup in sheltered areas). In
            areas with significant water runoff, the dust layer can be as thin as 1 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on exposed surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            pools/puddles in recessed areas, thick crusts in sheltered areas with high humidity, discrete patches around point
            sources, and stains caused by the leaching of soluble components from the dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Uniformity is higher on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces and lower on exposed vertical surfaces. The presence of surface irregularities significantly impacts
            uniformity.
        boron carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the Boron Carbide surface. Color darkens due to chemical reactions
            (oxidation) and the accumulation of more particulate matter. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more
            pronounced.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges. Within weeks, the dust spreads inward from the edges and thickens in crevices. Over months,
            layering effects become visible, and the dust becomes more compacted. Seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates can further influence the buildup pattern.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Tan (#E8DDCB) with a slight grey tint due to soot.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Pale Yellow-Brown (#CDB38B) indicating initial oxidation of iron compounds.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Rust-Orange (#B7410E) due to increased iron oxide concentration.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#654321) with possible black patches from concentrated soot and organic matter.'
          - 'Calcium Rich: Off-White (#F8F8FF) with a chalky appearance, if CaCO₃ is a dominant component.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Initial deposition
            often appears as a thin, relatively uniform film, which then thickens in specific areas due to gravity and airflow
            patterns. Streaking may occur on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Top surfaces
            exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit the
            highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Thick, obscuring layer. Original Boron Carbide surface is largely hidden. Significant texture change.
              thickness: '>100 μm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Significant dust buildup. Color is strongly altered. Surface texture is noticeably rough. Crevices
                are largely filled.
              thickness: 25-100 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Thin, patchy film. Color is subtly altered. Surface texture remains largely unchanged.
              thickness: 1-5 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Visible layer with noticeable color change. Texture becomes slightly rougher. Crevices begin to
                fill.
              thickness: 5-25 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Barely visible, scattered particles. Appears as a slight dulling of the Boron Carbide surface.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Environmental dust on Boron Carbide typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from
            light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the local soil composition and industrial pollutants. The dust tends
            to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a slightly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (initial deposition), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic forces and airflow), point source spreading (from localized emission sources), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition due to surface irregularities),
            and streaky/linear (due to water runoff). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as
            collection points, leading to increased buildup. Depressions and surface irregularities trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust. Runs down slopes are common, especially after
            rain. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but less than horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with a slightly brighter, more saturated color.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the color and reduce contrast. No significant sheen or iridescence
            is typically observed unless oily contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly crusty and granular
            with age. It feels gritty to the touch, especially with higher concentrations of SiO₂ and Al₂O₃. Close inspection
            reveals a matte finish with no significant gloss unless moisture is present.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a thin film of 1-5 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            50-200 μm in crevices and sheltered locations. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered areas
            with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform
            coatings (rare, initial stage), buildups (in crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and runs/streaks (due
            to water flow).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due
            to variations in surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and airflow patterns. The level of uniformity depends
            heavily on the environmental conditions and the source of the dust.
        boron nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adhered to the surface, often exhibiting darker, more saturated
            colors due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases over time, and the dust may become
            slightly hardened or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly across the surface
            (hours). Over days, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer, with preferential accumulation
            at edges and in crevices. Over months, the layer thickens and becomes more compacted, with potential for chemical
            reactions and staining. Seasonal variations in dust composition and humidity can lead to layering effects, where
            different layers of dust with varying colors and textures are deposited on top of each other.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D0CB), Aged dust: Muted reddish-brown (#A0785A), Soot-rich
            areas: Dark gray (#4A4A4A), Iron oxide staining: Burnt Sienna (#E97451), Pollen concentration: Yellowish-beige
            (#F5F5DC).'
          common_patterns: Distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges.
            Streaking can occur on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer. Point source spreading is common near ventilation ducts or other sources of airborne particles.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction
            and air flow patterns. Crevices and low-lying areas accumulate more dust than raised surfaces. Top surfaces exposed
            to the environment are generally more contaminated than sheltered bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and particles, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, patchy film, slightly obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A more continuous layer, partially obscuring the surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, obscuring
            layer, significantly altering the surface appearance. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring
            layer, completely covering the surface. Thickness: >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Boron Nitride typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a muted, earthy tone.
            The color is often a blend of light browns and grays, with localized variations depending on the specific dust
            composition and exposure conditions. Coverage can range from sparse speckling to a complete, obscuring coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in low-traffic
            areas), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and air currents), point source spreading (from vents
            or machinery), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to localized
            deposition), and streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and air currents. The perimeter of the Boron Nitride part will often have a slightly darker or thicker band of
            dust compared to the central areas. This is especially noticeable on flat, exposed surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced air flow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and runs due to gravity.
            Edges act as collection points, concentrating dust along their length. Depressions and indentations fill with
            dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident on
            vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating
            a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes are common. Pooling occurs at bottom edges, where dust accumulates due
            to gravitational settling and moisture condensation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant and reveals subtle color variations.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust appear more uniformly gray. There
            is no significant sheen or gloss; the surface remains matte. No iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch. At
            higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including spherical
            pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and fibrous organic matter. The surface is matte, not glossy.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            50-200 μm in heavily contaminated areas. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high
            humidity and dust concentration), discrete patches (due to localized deposition), spots/dots (from individual
            dust particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (in
            corners and crevices), and drip marks/runs (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on air currents, surface orientation, and the presence of
            localized dust sources. Horizontal surfaces in enclosed environments tend to be more uniform than vertical or
            exposed surfaces.
        borosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays
            are common. Thickness increases over time, and the texture can transition from powdery to crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward (days-weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in sheltered environments.
            Point sources expand outward over time (weeks-months). Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and deposition rates (months-years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0785A), Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich dust: Burnt Sienna (#E9724D), Pollen-dominant dust: Yellowish-Tan (#F0E68C).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Edges often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. Point source spreading can occur from localized contamination events.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Crevices and sheltered
            areas trap dust, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to
            gravity and runoff. Exposed areas may have lower concentrations due to wind and rain.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film, slightly obscuring the surface (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, obscuring
            some details of the surface (20-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick dust layer, significantly obscuring the surface
            (50-100 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick dust layer, completely obscuring the surface, potentially forming crusts
            (100+ μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on borosilicate glass typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, leading to variations in thickness and concentration. Over time, the dust can become more compacted
            and darker in color.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (common on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (from localized events), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due
            to rain or condensation), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The perimeter of the glass often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on larger surfaces and in environments with significant airflow.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. It
            builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas for deposition. It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal
            surfaces. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction.
            It follows contours, conforming to the surface shape. It bridges gaps, forming dust webs. It fills depressions,
            creating a more even surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces, creating a more uniform coating. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. Can hang from overhead
            surfaces in the form of dust webs, but this is less common on borosilicate glass than on rougher surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with variations in color and texture
            becoming more visible. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, reducing contrast. The dust
            layer generally exhibits a matte finish, with minimal sheen or gloss. Iridescence is not typically observed unless
            specific contaminants (e.g., certain metallic oxides) are present.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly abrasive. With moisture and time, it can become
            sticky or crusty. At a microscopic level, individual particles are visible, ranging from smooth, rounded grains
            to irregular, angular fragments. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) to heavy buildup (100-500 μm), depending on environmental
            conditions and exposure time. Extreme buildup can reach thicknesses of 1 mm or more in sheltered areas with prolonged
            exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved
            contaminants), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), and buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations is possible on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately patchy distribution is common on
            vertical surfaces and in areas with airflow. Highly variable/irregular distribution occurs in exposed environments
            with complex geometries. Uniformity is influenced by airflow, surface orientation, and the nature of the dust
            source.
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic matter decomposition),
            and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the texture can become more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., fingerprints) and then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward,
            or it can be a more uniform gradual accumulation across the entire surface. Point sources expand outward, creating
            radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Months of accumulation can lead to significant crust formation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones reflecting the brass. Aged
            dust: Ranges from a muted brownish-gray (#848482) to a reddish-brown (#A0522D, Sienna) due to iron oxide accumulation.
            In industrial areas, soot can darken the color to almost black (#212121). Pollen can add yellow or green hues.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, along edges, and in corners. On vertical surfaces,
            streaks and drip marks are common due to gravity and moisture. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more
            uniform layer. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby vent) will create a radial distribution pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations.
            Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity and runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A very light dusting, barely visible, with individual particles scattered
            across the surface. Thickness: <10 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film, easily removed. Thickness: 10-25 μm.
            Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original brass finish in some areas. Thickness: 25-100 μm.
            Heavy (60-85%): A thick, continuous layer, significantly altering the appearance of the brass. Thickness: 100-250
            μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, encrusted layer, completely obscuring the original brass finish. Thickness:
            >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on brass presents as a fine particulate layer, typically exhibiting muted earth
            tones. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly adherent depending on humidity and composition. Coverage varies
            from sparse to complete, often accumulating in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (common near vents or machinery), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (common in areas with variable airflow), streaky/linear
            (common on vertical surfaces due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to a combination of factors: increased
            surface area, electrostatic attraction, and airflow patterns that concentrate particles at boundaries. The center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer, unless there is a specific point source of contamination.'
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas, especially if moisture is present. It drips on
            vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension and airflow. It follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the brass surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven water runoff carrying dust particles. Settling
            on horizontal surfaces is a primary mechanism for dust accumulation. Runs down slopes are observed on inclined
            surfaces. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, but this is less common and requires specific conditions (e.g.,
            electrostatic charge).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically has a matte finish, diffusing light. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The presence of oily components in the dust can create
            a slight sheen in certain areas. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and easily disturbed. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky
            or crusty. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles of varying sizes and shapes are visible. The surface
            is generally rough due to the particulate nature of the dust.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) or even a millimeter (1 mm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. A 'paper-thin' layer is approximately
            50-100 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on inclined surfaces),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture), discrete patches (due to localized
            contamination), spots/dots (from aerosolized particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare outside of controlled laboratory settings. The level of uniformity is affected by airflow
            patterns, surface orientation, and the presence of surface imperfections.
        breccia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, it becomes more compacted
            and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to the accumulation of organic matter and chemical
            reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases gradually, and the texture may become more crusty or
            cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges. Over time, the
            film thickens and spreads, gradually covering more of the surface. Dust accumulates more rapidly in sheltered
            areas and on horizontal surfaces. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            deposition rates. This process can take days to months to reach significant levels.
          color_variations: Fresh dust ranges from a light tan (#D2B48C) to a pale yellowish-brown (#CDB38B). As it ages and
            absorbs moisture/organic matter, it darkens to a muted reddish-brown (#A0785A) or even a dark grayish-brown (#6D5642).
            Soot particles can introduce dark gray (#4A4A4A) or black (#000000) speckling. Iron oxide contributions can create
            rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges.
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity and
            airflow patterns. Streaks and drip marks are often observed on vertical surfaces, indicating the influence of
            moisture. Localized spots and patches can form around point sources of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas compared
            to vertical surfaces and exposed areas. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices
            and depressions act as traps for dust particles. Top surfaces of breccia tend to have higher concentrations than
            bottom surfaces due to settling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling of dust, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable dust layer, but the underlying breccia is still clearly visible. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Significant dust coverage, partially obscuring the breccia surface. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): The breccia
            surface is largely obscured by dust. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): The breccia surface is almost completely
            covered by a thick layer of dust. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on breccia presents as a heterogeneous coating, typically dominated by earthy tones.
            The dust layer often exhibits a powdery or slightly crusty texture, with coverage varying from sparse speckling
            to near-complete obscuration of the underlying breccia surface. Accumulation is often influenced by surface geometry
            and gravity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (dust collects along edges and
            corners). 2) Crevice filling (dust settles into cracks and depressions). 3) Streaky/linear patterns (caused by
            water runoff). 4) Patchy/spotty distribution (due to localized sources). 5) Gradient from source (concentration
            decreases with distance from a point source). Edge accumulation and crevice filling are the most prevalent patterns.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to airflow patterns that concentrate dust particles at boundaries and the trapping effect of surface irregularities.
            The center areas of flat surfaces may have a more uniform but generally thinner layer of dust.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to settling. Runs
            down slopes are common, especially after rainfall. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas, forming
            small accumulations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. Darker areas with higher soot concentration
            may appear more absorbent of light. No significant iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a fine, powdery feel when dry to a slightly sticky or crusty consistency
            when damp. At close range, individual dust particles may be visible, exhibiting a granular or slightly crystalline
            structure depending on the mineral composition. The surface can feel slightly abrasive due to the presence of
            silica and other mineral particles.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in sparsely contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm or even 1-2 mm in areas of significant accumulation. In extreme cases, crusts can reach several
            millimeters in thickness.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (uniform or patchy coatings). 2) Thick crusts (cemented
            layers in areas of heavy accumulation). 3) Drip marks (vertical streaks caused by water runoff). 4) Runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks but less defined). 5) Discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination). 6) Stains (discoloration
            of the breccia surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in surface geometry, airflow, and contamination sources. The level of uniformity depends
            heavily on the environmental conditions and the duration of exposure.
        brick:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly bound to the brick surface, often requiring scrubbing to remove. Color darkens
            over time due to the accumulation of organic matter and soot. The texture becomes more consolidated and less powdery.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film deposited uniformly across the surface (hours/days). Over time
            (days/weeks), dust accumulates preferentially at edges and in crevices. With continued exposure (weeks/months),
            the dust layer thickens and becomes more consolidated, especially in sheltered areas. Seasonal variations in rainfall
            and wind can lead to layering effects, with alternating layers of light and dark dust.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D) to a darker, sooty gray (#434A54) where soot is prevalent. Areas with higher iron
            content may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Pollen can introduce a yellowish-green tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, mortar joints, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks from rainwater runoff. Sheltered areas under eaves or overhangs tend to
            have thicker, more uniform dust layers. Wind-exposed areas may show localized scouring and reduced dust accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas (under
            eaves, overhangs). Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces of bricks
            on walls exposed to rain have less dust than the bottom surfaces of the same bricks. Vertical walls have a gradient
            from top (less dust) to bottom (more dust, drip marks).
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film, slightly alters brick color, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, obscures original brick color,
            20-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily removable layer, significantly alters brick color, 100-300 μm thick.
            Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, almost completely obscures brick, >300 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on brick presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by muted earth tones.
            The texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular feel, depending on humidity and age. Coverage
            varies significantly, often concentrating in crevices and sheltered areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on sheltered horizontal surfaces.
            2) Edge accumulation along mortar joints and brick edges. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due
            to rainwater runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas exposed to varying wind and moisture conditions. 5)
            Localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced airflow
            and increased surface roughness. The edges of bricks and mortar joints act as barriers, trapping dust particles
            carried by wind and water. Flat, smooth center areas tend to have less accumulation due to easier removal by wind
            and rain.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat
            areas tend to collect dust more readily than curved surfaces. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks as water flows
            down, carrying dust particles. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust and creating localized buildups.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled dust. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs and streaks
            as dust is carried downhill by rainwater. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the grayish tones. In humid conditions, a slight sheen may be observed due to moisture
            absorption. Soot-rich areas absorb light, appearing darker and less reflective.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is a fine, powdery layer, easily disturbed. With moisture, it can become slightly
            sticky or crusty. Under magnification (10x), individual particles of varying sizes and shapes are visible, including
            angular mineral fragments and rounded pollen grains. The surface feels rougher with increasing dust accumulation.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to 50-500 μm or
            more for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. Extreme accumulations in crevices can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas where moisture accumulates. 3) Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4) Discrete patches in
            areas with localized sources of contamination. 5) Stains where water has dissolved and redeposited dust components.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low due to variations in surface texture, exposure to wind and rain, and the presence of sheltered areas. Horizontal
            surfaces under overhangs tend to be more uniform than exposed vertical walls.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated and adheres more strongly to the bronze surface. The color darkens
            over time due to the accumulation of organic matter and the oxidation of iron compounds. The thickness also increases,
            and the texture becomes more crusty.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface. Over time,
            these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Dust accumulates more rapidly at contact points and
            edges. The layer thickens gradually, with seasonal variations in deposition rates. Layering effects can occur
            due to changes in the composition of the dust over time (e.g., pollen season vs. industrial activity). Timeframe:
            Initial film forms within hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant accumulation within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DDC7) with subtle grey undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown
            (#A0522D, Sienna) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3D2B1F) where organic matter is present. Areas with higher
            iron oxide content exhibit rust-orange hues (#B7410E). Soot-rich areas appear greyish-black (#434A54).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity. A common pattern is a gradient of dust concentration,
            with thicker deposits near the base of vertical surfaces and thinner deposits higher up.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical surfaces show a gradient, with higher concentrations
            near the base. Top surfaces of horizontal features tend to have less dust than the undersides, which are sheltered
            from direct deposition.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, slightly obscures the bronze surface, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, partially obscures
            the bronze, 15-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring layer, significantly alters the appearance of the
            bronze, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, almost completely obscures the bronze, >100
            μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on bronze typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform
            coating that obscures the original bronze luster.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation), localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to the
            increased surface area and reduced airflow in these areas. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform coating. The perimeter of an object often shows a higher concentration of dust than the interior.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat
            areas tend to collect dust more evenly than curved surfaces. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks.
            Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions and indentations act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust particles settle on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at
            bottom edges. Runs develop down slopes. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, forming small stalactite-like structures
            in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to accentuate the greyish tones. The presence of oily or greasy components in the dust can create
            a slight sheen in certain areas. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. Under magnification (100x),
            individual particles of varying sizes and shapes are visible. The surface can feel slightly gritty due to the
            presence of silica and other mineral particles. In areas with moisture, the dust can become slightly sticky or
            crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, buildup in sheltered areas can reach thicknesses
            of up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture),
            discrete patches (due to localized sources), spots/dots (due to individual particles), stains (from dissolved
            contaminants), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The level of uniformity is influenced by airflow patterns, surface geometry, and the presence of moisture.
            Sheltered areas tend to accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        calcite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, potentially forming a harder, more adherent crust. Color darkens over
            time due to oxidation of iron compounds and accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases with time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, the film thickens and becomes more uniform. After weeks, dust begins to accumulate in crevices and along
            edges. Months of exposure lead to the formation of a consolidated layer that can harden into a crust. Seasonal
            variations in dust concentration and humidity can create layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust: #A0522D (sienna), Soot-rich areas: #36454F (charcoal grey),
            Iron-rich areas: #B7410E (rust-orange), Pollen-rich areas: #EEE8AA (pale goldenrod).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation in crevices and along edges is common. Horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform
            coating than vertical surfaces, which often exhibit streaks or drip marks. Areas sheltered from wind and rain
            may have thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices often accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to the environment typically
            have higher concentrations than undersides. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity and
            runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, individual particles scattered across the surface, thickness
            <1 μm. Light (10-30%): a faint haze, surface color slightly altered, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): a noticeable
            layer, surface details partially obscured, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): a thick coating, surface details
            significantly obscured, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): a very thick crust, surface details completely obscured,
            thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on calcite presents as a fine, often uneven layer, typically ranging from light
            tan to reddish-brown. The texture is generally powdery or slightly gritty, and the distribution is influenced
            by gravity and surface geometry, leading to variations in concentration and thickness.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces indoors), edge
            accumulation (corners and edges), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to reduced airflow
            and electrostatic effects. The perimeter of a calcite sample often shows a higher concentration of dust compared
            to the center. This is due to the edge acting as a physical barrier, trapping airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking. Edges act
            as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions and pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Settling of dust particles
            is a primary mechanism for deposition on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common after rain events.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant, with subtle variations in color becoming
            more apparent. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust appear more uniform
            in color. The surface is generally matte, with minimal gloss or sheen unless a significant amount of oily residue
            is present.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual dust
            particles are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface is generally matte, with
            occasional specular reflections from larger, smoother particles. Can become slightly sticky if moisture is present.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with minimal
            cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles or small aggregates), stains (caused by dissolved
            contaminants), drip marks (vertical surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is influenced by airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the presence of localized sources of contamination.
            Indoor horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than outdoor or vertical surfaces.
        carbon fiber reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and more difficult to remove. Color shifts towards darker browns
            and grays, potentially with reddish-brown (iron oxide) staining. Thickness increases over time, and the dust can
            become embedded in microscopic surface imperfections.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film thickens and becomes
            more noticeable. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly than flat surfaces. Over weeks and months, the
            dust layer becomes more compacted and difficult to remove. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates. The dust can become embedded in microscopic surface imperfections over
            time.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Grayish Tan (#D3D3D3 with a slight yellow tint)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Tan (#D2B48C)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dusty Brown (#A98D68)'
          - 'Heavily Aged (with iron oxide): Rust-Tinged Brown (#8B4513 with #B7410E flecks)'
          - 'Soot-Heavy: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A)'
          common_patterns: The dust tends to accumulate more heavily in recessed areas, along edges, and in areas sheltered
            from wind or rain. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform
            coverage, but with variations due to airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat, exposed areas. Crevices and recessed areas act as dust traps,
            leading to higher concentrations. The top surfaces of horizontal components may have higher concentrations than
            the bottom surfaces due to settling dust.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'A very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave. Thickness:
                >100 μm, potentially reaching 0.5-1 mm in extreme cases.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'A thick, opaque layer that almost completely obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave. Thickness:
                30-100 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'A thin, patchy layer that partially obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave. Thickness: 2-10
                μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'A more noticeable layer that significantly obscures the carbon fiber weave. Thickness: 10-30 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible dust, appearing as a slight dulling of the surface. Thickness: 1-2 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on CFRP typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant grayish-tan
            color. Coverage varies significantly depending on exposure, but often accumulates in crevices and along edges,
            creating a non-uniform appearance. The dust layer obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave to varying degrees
            depending on thickness.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, 2) Edge
            accumulation along perimeters and raised features, 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rain
            or condensation runoff, 4) Localized concentrations around point sources of contamination (e.g., vents, machinery),
            5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with irregular airflow.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in recessed areas. This is due
            to reduced airflow at edges, which allows dust particles to settle more easily. Edges also act as barriers, trapping
            dust and preventing it from being blown away. Center areas tend to have lower dust concentrations due to higher
            airflow and less obstruction.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical
            surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust and creating buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more
            uniform layer. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in recessed areas. Overhanging surfaces may accumulate dust
            on their underside, but to a lesser extent than horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Soot-heavy areas absorb more light and appear darker.
            The dust layer diffuses light, reducing the reflectivity of the underlying CFRP.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the composition and particle
            size of the dust. It feels dry to the touch. At close range (10x magnification), individual particles of varying
            shapes and sizes are visible. Aged dust can become slightly compacted and harder to remove.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 50-200 μm or more
            in sheltered areas. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 0.5-1 mm in areas with prolonged exposure and minimal
            cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces, 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces, 3) Discrete patches in areas with localized contamination, 4) Buildups in corners and crevices,
            5) Stains from dissolved contaminants (e.g., iron oxide). Thick crusts can form in areas with prolonged exposure
            to moisture and dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of surface features
            that trap dust. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        carbon steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Over time (months/years), the dust
            layer darkens due to the incorporation of moisture and the oxidation of iron particles. The texture becomes more
            consolidated and resistant to removal. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Accumulation begins at contact points
            and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in sheltered environments. Point sources expand
            outward over days/weeks. Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates. Months of exposure lead to noticeable thickening and consolidation of the dust layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E9DAC1), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron Oxide staining: Burnt Sienna (#E07A5F), Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Green (#9ACD32, seasonal).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical surfaces
            exhibit streaks and drip marks. Wind exposure can create directional patterns. Point sources of contamination
            (e.g., nearby construction) lead to localized concentrations that spread outwards.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal members accumulate more dust
            than undersides. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, color change noticeable, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Partial coverage, distinct color change,
            thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage, obscuring original surface, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick layer, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on carbon steel presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by earthy
            tones ranging from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture varies from fine powdery deposits to more consolidated,
            crust-like formations depending on humidity and exposure. Coverage patterns are often uneven, influenced by gravity
            and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered environments), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic effects and surface tension), point source spreading (from localized emission sources),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface roughness),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and
            depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and surface
            tension. The increased surface area and sharper angles at edges also promote dust capture. Center areas tend to
            have lower concentrations unless they are horizontal surfaces prone to settling.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation. Crevices act as traps for dust particles.
            Flat areas allow dust to settle and accumulate. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges concentrate
            dust due to electrostatic effects. Contours influence airflow and dust deposition patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead
            surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface irregularities. Soot-rich areas appear darker and
            less reflective under all lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Feels powdery when dry, becoming slightly sticky or muddy when damp. Close inspection reveals a
            fine granular structure, with occasional larger particles of sand or organic matter. Aged deposits can form a
            hard, crusty layer, sometimes exhibiting a slightly crystalline appearance due to calcium carbonate precipitation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). Extreme cases in sheltered areas
            can reach up to 2 mm, resembling a thin crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity),
            discrete patches (around point sources), spots/dots (due to individual dust particles), stains (caused by iron
            oxide leaching), uniform coatings (in enclosed environments), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: 'Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by: surface roughness, airflow patterns, moisture gradients, and the
            location of contamination sources.'
        cast iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (more reddish-brown or gray), and more difficult to
            remove. The thickness increases, and the texture can become crustier due to chemical reactions with the iron surface
            and atmospheric moisture.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Initially, dust accumulates
            at contact points and edges. Over weeks, the dust spreads inward from the edges and contact points. Uniform gradual
            accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Layering effects can be observed with seasonal variations in dust
            composition and deposition rates. Months lead to consolidated and thicker layers.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0), Aged dust (weeks): Dusty Rose (#BC8F8F), Iron-rich dust: Reddish-Brown
            (#A0522D), Soot-heavy dust: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A), Calcium Carbonate Rich Dust: Off-White (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, corners, and along edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform coating. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            streaks and drip marks from water runoff carrying the dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices where dust accumulates.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform but potentially thicker layer. Vertical surfaces have a gradient
            from top to bottom, with heavier concentrations at the bottom due to gravity and water runoff. Sheltered areas
            accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin film (5-10 μm). Light (10-30%): A faint dusting,
            easily removed (10-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures the original surface texture (25-50 μm).
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly alters the appearance of the surface (50-100 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very
            thick, crusty buildup, may obscure surface details (100+ μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on cast iron typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content and age of the deposit. The dust
            tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, 2) Edge
            accumulation along corners and edges, 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, 4)
            Localized concentrations around point sources of dust generation (e.g., vents), 5) Patchy/spotty distribution
            in areas with uneven airflow.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic
            attraction and reduced airflow. The center areas of flat surfaces may have a more uniform but thinner layer. This
            is because edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by air currents.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust. Slopes exhibit runs of dust. Overhead surfaces
            may have dust hanging in loose clumps.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a slightly brighter, more diffuse reflection. Soot-rich areas may exhibit a slight sheen. No iridescence
            is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At close range (10x magnification),
            individual particles of varying sizes (5-50 μm) are visible. Depending on humidity, it can become slightly sticky
            or crusty. The surface feels rough, similar to fine sandpaper.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 100-500
            μm in sheltered areas. Extreme cases in industrial settings can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces, 2) Drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            3) Buildups in corners and crevices, 4) Discrete patches in areas with localized dust sources, 5) Stains where
            water has dissolved and redeposited dust components, 6) Crusts in areas with high humidity and prolonged exposure.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. It is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface roughness, airflow, and electrostatic charge. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical
            surfaces. Crevices and edges are always non-uniform.
        cedar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more embedded in the cedar's surface, harder to remove, and darker in color due to chemical reactions
            (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases gradually, and the dust may become slightly cemented or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads. Edges accumulate dust faster than center areas. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in sheltered
            environments. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust
            composition and deposition rates. Months of exposure result in a thicker, more embedded layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust: Darker, reddish-brown (#805E49) due to
            iron oxide. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#D2B48C). Areas with
            moisture: Dark brown (#4E342E).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is heaviest on horizontal surfaces and in crevices. Streaking occurs on vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation. Edges and corners tend to collect more dust due to electrostatic attraction and wind
            patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and grooves act as dust traps, leading
            to higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film (1-10 μm). Light (10-30%): Light dusting,
            cedar grain still clearly visible (10-30 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, partially obscuring the grain
            (30-80 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, grain mostly obscured, color significantly altered (80-150 μm). Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the grain (150-200 μm+).'
          description: Environmental dust on cedar presents as a fine, matte layer, typically brownish-gray in color, that
            obscures the natural grain. Coverage varies from light dusting to heavy accumulation, depending on exposure and
            time. The dust tends to settle into the cedar's porous surface, making it appear dull and aged.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered areas), edge accumulation (due to
            wind and electrostatic effects), point source spreading (from nearby construction or industrial activity), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture), streaky/linear
            (due to rain runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to wind patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Center areas may have lower
            concentrations due to wind scouring.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than sloped surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges
            act as barriers, trapping dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Runs down slopes are common,
            especially during rain events. Dust hangs from overhead surfaces only in very sheltered environments with minimal
            airflow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a more muted, grayish tone. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed unless oil or other
            contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine, becoming more compacted and slightly crusty with moisture and time.
            Feels gritty to the touch, especially with higher concentrations of silica. The cedar's natural grain remains
            perceptible beneath the dust layer, but the dust fills the pores, creating a slightly rough surface.
          thickness_range: Ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (sparse) to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm (extreme), varying
            with exposure and time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on sheltered surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete patches
            (due to localized sources), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity depends
            on the cedar's surface orientation and exposure to wind and rain. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered areas tend
            to have more uniform coverage than exposed vertical surfaces.
        cement:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time, it darkens and becomes
            more tightly bound to the cement surface, often incorporating moisture and organic growth. Thickness increases,
            and the texture can transition from powdery to crusty. Algae and lichen growth may become visible in humid environments.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited from the air. Over time, these
            particles accumulate and become more tightly bound to the surface. Moisture can cause the dust to consolidate
            and form a crust. The rate of buildup varies depending on environmental conditions and the proximity to dust sources.
            Seasonal variations in dust levels can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust (days): Light brown with reddish
            undertones (#A67B5B). Aged dust (weeks/months, dry): Pale yellowish-brown (#E3DAC9). Aged dust (weeks/months,
            wet): Darker, muddy brown (#746450) with possible green algae tints.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to gravity and wind patterns. Streaking
            on vertical surfaces due to rain runoff. Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. Localized spots near point sources
            of contamination (e.g., exhaust vents).
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Sheltered areas (e.g., under overhangs) may have
            heavier buildup than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal elements tend to have more dust than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin film,
            cement color still visible, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Partial obscuring of cement color, thickness
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant obscuring of cement color, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost
            complete obscuring of cement color, thick layer, thickness >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on cement presents as a fine, particulate layer, typically light to medium brown,
            that obscures the underlying cement color. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly crusty depending on humidity
            and age. Coverage varies from sparse to nearly complete, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation (corners
            and edges), point source spreading (around vents or chimneys), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to reduced wind
            exposure and the barrier effect of the edge itself. The center of large, flat surfaces tends to have slightly
            less accumulation due to greater wind exposure.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and gravitational settling.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking. Edges act
            as barriers, trapping dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of airborne dust. The angle of a surface significantly
            affects dust accumulation, with steeper angles accumulating less dust.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears lighter and more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can emphasize the grayish tones. A slight sheen may be visible on areas where the dust has been compacted by moisture
            or pressure. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and easily disturbed. With moisture, it becomes slightly sticky and can form
            a thin crust. Under magnification (100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including
            angular mineral fragments and rounded organic particles. Feels gritty to the touch, especially when dry.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with minimal
            disturbance, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup in
            humid environments), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (caused
            by moisture dissolving dust components), uniform coatings (horizontal surfaces), drip marks (vertical surfaces),
            buildups (corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is affected
            by wind patterns, surface orientation, and the presence of obstacles. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform
            coverage than vertical surfaces.
        ceramic matrix composites cmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time (months/years),
            the dust becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and
            reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film of individual particles that adhere to the surface.
            Over time, more particles accumulate, forming a thicker, more continuous layer. The process often begins at contact
            points (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and deposition rates. This process can take days to months to years depending on the environment.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Tan (#E8DDC7) with slight gray undertones'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Pale Yellowish-Brown (#CDB38B)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dusty Rose (#BC8F8F) with hints of iron oxide'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with darker brown patches'
          - 'Soot-Contaminated: Dark Grayish-Brown (#4A4444) with black specks'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from wind or rain.
            On flat surfaces, a thin, relatively uniform layer may form, but this is often disrupted by streaks or localized
            concentrations. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and areas near
            potential dust sources (e.g., vents) exhibit the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'A very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures the CMC surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'A thick, opaque layer that almost completely obscures the CMC surface. Thickness: 50-100 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'A thin, patchy layer that partially obscures the underlying CMC surface. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'A more continuous layer that significantly obscures the CMC surface, but the underlying texture
                is still visible. Thickness: 10-50 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible dust, appearing as a faint haze or scattered particles. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on CMCs typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform
            coating that obscures the underlying CMC texture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), uniform coating (on
            sheltered horizontal surfaces), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to wind or rain).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and surface
            tension effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles and promoting buildup. The center areas of
            flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry strongly influences dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer, while vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust and promoting buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust, leading to a more uniform accumulation.
            Runs down slopes are common, especially after rain.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly brighter and more reflective, but still
            maintains a matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the yellow and brown tones. No significant
            iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch, due to the presence of silica
            and alumina particles. At higher magnification, individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) can be observed.
            Organic particulates and soot contribute to a slightly sticky or greasy feel in some areas. The surface is matte,
            not glossy.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm or more in crevices and sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in crevices), drip
            marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff), discrete patches (due to localized deposition),
            stains (from dissolved contaminants), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy. The dust is rarely perfectly uniform across the
            entire surface due to variations in airflow, surface roughness, and exposure to the elements. Sheltered areas
            accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        cerium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust compacts and adheres more strongly to the cerium surface. Color darkens due to oxidation of organic matter
            and iron compounds. Thickness increases with continued deposition. Aged dust is more difficult to remove and may
            require mechanical cleaning.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward, creating a gradient. Layering effects can be observed with seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration. After months, the dust compacts and adheres more strongly, forming a thicker, more cohesive
            layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones. Aged dust (weeks): Yellowish-brown
            (#966F33) with hints of rust-orange. Heavily contaminated/aged: Reddish-brown (#A0522D) with darker brown (#654321)
            in crevices. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to almost black (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Pale yellow (#FFFFE0).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity.
            Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Areas sheltered from wind or rain tend to have thicker
            deposits. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby vent) results in a gradient of decreasing concentration
            away from the source.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges and in crevices. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            more dust than vertical surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to the environment tend to have heavier contamination than
            bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Flat surfaces can have relatively
            uniform dust layers, but with localized variations due to surface imperfections.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy layer, color barely noticeable, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Visible layer, color apparent, thickness
            5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, color distinct, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer,
            significant color change, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on cerium typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, leading to variations in thickness and concentration across the surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments).
            2) Edge accumulation (very common, due to airflow patterns). 3) Point source spreading (common near vents or other
            sources). 4) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition
            or localized sources). 6) Streaky/linear (due to rain or condensation runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            effects. The edges act as a barrier, trapping dust particles carried by the air. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform layer, especially on flat surfaces. In some cases, localized sources in the center can lead to higher
            concentrations there.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as
            barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions and surface imperfections provide nucleation sites for dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes experience runs and streaks.
            Overhead surfaces may have dust hanging in loose aggregates.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant, with subtle color variations becoming
            more apparent. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust look more uniform
            in color. The dust layer is generally matte, so there is minimal specular reflection. Soot-rich areas absorb more
            light and appear darker.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution.
            It feels dry to the touch. At higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen,
            angular mineral fragments, fibrous organic matter) are visible. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant
            gloss unless oily components are present.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of
            1-2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial deposition). 2) Thick crusts (aged, compacted
            dust). 3) Discrete patches (localized contamination). 4) Spots/dots (individual particles or small aggregates).
            5) Stains (due to leaching of soluble components). 6) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 7) Runs/streaks (due
            to water runoff). 8) Buildups (at edges and in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, proximity to dust sources, and cleaning
            frequency. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        cherry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, the dust compacts and
            adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays as organic matter decomposes
            and soot accumulates. Thickness increases gradually, potentially leading to visible crusting or staining.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, typically within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks. Initial deposition often occurs at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is observed on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns.
            Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup
            (visible crusting) typically takes months to years.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0C0C0). Aged dust (weeks): Light brown with reddish
            undertones (#A68A64). Heavily soiled/soot-rich: Dark grayish-brown (#4A4A4A). Pollen-rich: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA).
            Iron-rich: Reddish-brown (#8B4513).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, corners, and along edges due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. On horizontal surfaces, a more uniform coating is observed, while vertical surfaces
            exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity. Areas sheltered from direct airflow tend to accumulate more dust
            than exposed surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces due to settling. Corners and
            recessed areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Flat surfaces show relatively uniform, but lighter, dust layers.
            Vertical walls show a gradient from heavier accumulation at the top (initial impact) to lighter accumulation at
            the bottom (due to runoff).
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            easily disturbed layer, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Visible layer, slightly obscuring the underlying
            surface, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significantly obscuring the underlying surface, thickness
            100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the underlying surface, thickness > 250
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on cherry wood presents as a fine, matte layer, typically exhibiting a light tan
            to grayish-brown coloration. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating subtle visual
            contrast against the underlying cherry's natural reddish tones. Coverage varies significantly depending on environmental
            conditions and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (corners and edges), point source spreading (around vents or openings), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due
            to gravity), localized concentrations (crevices and recessed areas), and patchy/spotty (uneven surfaces). Edge
            accumulation and uniform coating are the most prevalent patterns.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform distribution. The mechanism causing
            this behavior is primarily related to the boundary layer effect, where airflow is slower near the edges, allowing
            dust particles to settle more readily.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced
            airflow and electrostatic attraction. It builds up in crevices, filling depressions and following contours. Flat
            areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking. Edges act as
            collection points, leading to increased dust concentration. The physical reasons are primarily related to airflow
            dynamics and gravitational forces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to uniform
            accumulation. Runs down slopes are observed on inclined surfaces. Pooling at bottom edges occurs due to gravitational
            settling. The effect is more pronounced in humid environments where moisture increases particle adhesion and cohesion.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the grayish tones of the dust. In oblique lighting, surface irregularities and particle
            agglomerations become more apparent. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine to the touch when freshly deposited. Over time, moisture
            and organic matter can cause the dust to become slightly sticky or crusty, especially in humid environments. At
            high magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including spherical pollen
            grains, angular mineral fragments, and irregular soot aggregates.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup in sheltered areas). Average
            thickness on exposed surfaces is typically between 10-100 μm. In extreme cases, dust layers can reach thicknesses
            of 1-2 mm in undisturbed crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (on exposed surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            discrete patches (on uneven surfaces), spots/dots (initial deposition points), stains (after prolonged contact
            with moisture), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), and buildups (in crevices and corners). Drip marks
            and thin films are the most commonly observed formations.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on the surface orientation and exposure. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to exhibit mostly uniform distribution with minor variations in thickness. Vertical surfaces are
            typically moderately patchy due to gravity-induced streaking. Crevices and corners show highly variable/irregular
            concentrations. The uniformity level is primarily influenced by airflow patterns and gravitational forces.
        chrome-plated steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination becomes darker
            and more tightly adhered to the surface. The color shifts towards reddish-brown due to oxidation of iron particles.
            Thickness increases over time, and the texture can become more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It begins at contact points (edges,
            corners) and then spreads outward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point
            sources expand outward over days and weeks. Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration. Over months, the dust thickens and becomes more tightly adhered.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust (weeks): Yellowish-brown (#A07A44).
            Aged dust (months, with iron oxide): Reddish-brown (#8B4513 to #A52A2A). Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F).
            Pollen-rich areas: Pale yellow (#FAFAD2).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and accumulation in crevices and along edges. Point source spreading occurs around ventilation outlets or other
            sources of dust generation. Streaking is common due to rain or condensation runoff.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Edges and corners often accumulate more dust due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Crevices
            and sheltered areas trap dust, leading to higher concentrations. Exposed areas are typically lighter due to wind
            and rain removal. Top surfaces of horizontal components can accumulate more dust than the undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin film,
            slightly noticeable, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Visible layer, alters surface appearance, 15-50 μm thick.
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, obscures surface details, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick buildup, significant
            alteration of surface texture, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on chrome-plated steel typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with
            a dominant color ranging from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity
            and surface geometry, leading to accumulations in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns), point source spreading (around vents
            or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition),
            streaky/linear (due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas tend to have less dust
            accumulation, especially on flat surfaces. This edge accumulation is more pronounced in areas with high dust concentrations
            and low airflow.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation and electrostatic attraction. It builds
            up in crevices, providing sheltered areas for deposition. It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces.
            It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to electrostatic forces. It follows contours,
            conforming to the surface shape. It bridges gaps, forming dust webs. It fills depressions, creating a more uniform
            surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces, creating a more uniform coating. Runs down slopes are observed on inclined surfaces. Dust rarely hangs
            from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with a matte finish that diffuses
            light. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust less noticeable. There is
            typically no sheen or iridescence, unless oil or grease is present in the dust.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine, like talc. Over time, moisture and organic matter can
            cause it to become slightly sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a granular texture, with individual particles
            visible under magnification (10x-20x). The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (light dust) to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm or more in sheltered areas. Extreme buildup can reach thicknesses of 0.5-1 mm in areas with prolonged exposure
            and minimal cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture), discrete patches (due to localized
            deposition), spots/dots (due to individual particle adhesion), stains (if the dust contains corrosive components),
            uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the environment. Perfectly uniform distribution is
            rare. Mostly uniform distribution occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately patchy distribution is common
            on vertical surfaces and in areas with airflow variations. Highly variable/irregular distribution is found in
            industrial environments with localized dust sources. The uniformity level is primarily determined by airflow,
            surface orientation, and dust source proximity.
        chromium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination (months/years)
            becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker grays and browns
            due to the accumulation of organic matter and oxidation of iron particles. Thickness increases over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces.
            Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration. Months of accumulation can lead to visible crust formation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) to Gray (#808080). Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C) with reddish-brown
            (Burnt Sienna #E97451) patches due to iron oxide. Soot accumulation: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9) to Black (#000000). Pollen
            concentration: Yellowish-Gray (#C0C0C0) with subtle green tints.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in sheltered areas, crevices, and along edges. On vertical surfaces, streaks
            and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, but with potential for pooling in
            depressions. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby vent) creates radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal components accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and
            sheltered areas exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, easily disturbed layer. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original
            surface finish. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, compacted layer, significantly altering the appearance.
            Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crust-like layer, completely obscuring the original surface.
            Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on chromium typically appears as a dull, matte layer ranging from light gray to
            brownish-gray, often with localized darker patches of soot or organic material. The texture is generally powdery
            or slightly gritty, and the distribution is influenced by surface geometry and airflow patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), Edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic effects and airflow), Point source spreading (radial pattern from a vent), Gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), Patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), Streaky/linear (on
            vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The increased surface area and sharp corners at edges promote particle deposition. Center areas tend
            to have lower concentrations, especially on flat surfaces exposed to airflow.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered
            areas. It pools on flat areas, especially if moisture is present. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction. It follows contours, creating visible patterns. It bridges
            gaps, forming dust webs.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes, creating visible trails. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, forming small stalactite-like
            structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal specular reflection. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Soot particles exhibit a slightly higher degree of light
            absorption, appearing darker. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow effect.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine powdery (like talc) to slightly gritty, depending on the particle
            size distribution. It feels dry to the touch. At higher magnification (100x), individual particles of varying
            shapes (spherical pollen, angular mineral fragments, fibrous organics) are visible. There is no inherent crystalline
            structure visible to the naked eye.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, localized
            accumulations can reach 1-2 mm, resembling a thin crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (on inclined surfaces),
            Thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), Thick crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation), Discrete patches (due
            to localized contamination), Spots/dots (individual dust particles or agglomerates), Stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            Uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), Buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is influenced by airflow, surface geometry, and the presence of localized contamination
            sources. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered environments tend to be more uniform than vertical or exposed surfaces.
        cobalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (months/years),
            the dust becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the cobalt surface. Color shifts towards darker browns
            and reds due to oxidation and chemical reactions. Thickness increases gradually, and the dust may become partially
            cemented by moisture and organic matter.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles deposited on the cobalt surface.
            Over time, these particles aggregate and form a more continuous layer. Accumulation often begins at contact points
            (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward. A uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more often, point sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates. Timeframes: noticeable film within hours, visible patches within days, significant buildup
            within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle beige undertones (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D, Sienna) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2723) where iron oxide is more
            concentrated. Areas with organic matter may exhibit a yellowish-brown hue (#B8860B, DarkGoldenrod). Soot presence
            shifts color towards dark gray (#4A4A4A).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges. On vertical surfaces,
            streaks and drip marks are frequently observed due to gravity. Horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform,
            albeit uneven, coating. Areas sheltered from wind and rain exhibit heavier accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow stagnation. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Crevices and depressions
            act as collection points. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier accumulation at the
            bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles or small patches, barely visible to the naked
            eye, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy layer with the underlying cobalt surface still clearly visible,
            thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous layer, partially obscuring the cobalt surface, thickness
            20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, almost opaque layer, significantly obscuring the cobalt surface, thickness 50-200
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer completely obscuring the cobalt surface, thickness >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on cobalt typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color range
            from light gray to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate
            in crevices and on horizontal surfaces, creating a patchy or uneven coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (common due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns), point source spreading (around vents
            or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from a dust source), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven surface texture or localized contamination), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity
            and water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points, attracting and trapping dust particles. The center areas tend to
            have a thinner, more uniform layer of dust compared to the edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling depressions and following contours. On flat areas, dust tends to pool, forming
            a relatively uniform layer. On vertical surfaces, dust drips, creating streaks. Edges act as collection points,
            leading to increased dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident on
            vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking
            is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Dust does not hang from overhead
            surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the dust distribution. Areas with higher iron oxide
            content may exhibit a slight reddish sheen under certain angles of illumination. No significant iridescence is
            expected.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly abrasive to the touch. Under
            magnification (100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. In areas with moisture, the
            dust can become slightly sticky or crusty, forming a thin, hardened layer.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for a freshly deposited, light layer
            to several hundred micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations
            can reach up to 1 mm thick.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on inclined surfaces),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with prolonged moisture exposure), discrete
            patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles or small aggregates), stains (caused
            by chemical reactions between dust components and the cobalt surface), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in corners
            and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, airflow patterns, electrostatic
            charge, and the presence of localized dust sources.
        concrete:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, relatively uniform coating. Over time, the dust layer darkens
            due to the accumulation of soot and organic matter. The texture may become more consolidated and crusty, especially
            in areas exposed to moisture. Thickness increases gradually over time, with seasonal variations in deposition
            rates.
          buildup_progression: Dust buildup starts as a thin film, typically within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks. Buildup often begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is common on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal
            variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Significant buildup (visible to the naked eye) typically
            takes weeks to months.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light grayish-tan (#D3D0CB) with subtle variations depending on local soil composition.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Pale brownish-gray (#A9A397) with a hint of yellow from pollen.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium gray-brown (#827A6E) with increased darkness from soot and organic matter.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark gray-brown (#5E5851) with potential reddish-brown (#A0785A) staining from iron oxide.'
          - 'Rain-Streaked: Alternating bands of light gray (#D3D0CB) and dark gray-brown (#5E5851) where water has washed
            away some of the dust.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, accumulation in crevices and corners,
            streaking on vertical surfaces due to rain runoff, and localized spots around point sources of contamination (e.g.,
            exhaust vents). Edges and areas sheltered from rain tend to accumulate more dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Edges and corners accumulate more dust than center areas due to wind patterns and surface tension. Crevices
            and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal elements accumulate more
            dust than bottom surfaces.

              description: Barely visible dust film, concrete color dominates, thickness < 1 μm.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Environmental dust on concrete presents as a generally matte, light-to-medium gray-brown layer that
            obscures the original concrete surface. The texture is typically powdery or slightly gritty, and the distribution
            is often uneven, influenced by wind, rain, and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (common on horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to wind patterns and surface tension), point source spreading (around vents or chimneys),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear
            (due to rain runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to wind patterns
            and surface tension. The mechanism is that wind tends to deposit particles at the edges of surfaces, and surface
            tension effects can trap particles in corners and crevices. Center areas tend to be more exposed to wind and rain,
            leading to lower dust accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and surface tension effects.
            It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to rain runoff. Dust collects at edges
            due to wind patterns. It follows contours of the concrete surface. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and
            drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rain runoff. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are observed. Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic
            forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the gray tones. Damp dust may exhibit a slight sheen. No iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution
            of the dust. It feels dry to the touch unless dampened by rain or humidity. At close range, individual dust particles
            are visible, often including fine sand grains, soot aggregates, and organic debris. Under magnification, crystalline
            structures of salts (e.g., calcium carbonate) may be observed, especially in arid environments.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm or more in sheltered areas or after prolonged exposure. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2
            mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to rain runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas), discrete patches (due to uneven deposition),
            spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (on horizontal
            surfaces), buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due to variations in surface roughness, wind exposure, and proximity to
            contamination sources. The uniformity level is influenced by the frequency and intensity of rain events, which
            tend to redistribute the dust.
        copper:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly bound to the copper surface, often incorporating corrosion products. Color
            shifts towards darker browns and grays. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more consolidated and less
            powdery. The aged layer is harder to remove and may require mechanical cleaning.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, the film thickens and becomes more continuous. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., corners,
            edges) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand
            outward in a radial pattern. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration
            (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) to pale yellow-brown (#C4A484). Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide content to a darker, sooty gray (#4A4A4A) where carbon particulates
            are prevalent. In humid environments, greenish-gray patches (#8FBC8F) can form due to copper corrosion products
            interacting with the dust layer. Pollen can add yellow/orange hues (#FFC300).'
          common_patterns: 'Distribution is highly variable. Common patterns include: (1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces.
            (2) Streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces. (3) Accumulation in crevices and corners. (4) Localized spots
            around point sources of contamination (e.g., vents, machinery). (5) Gradient patterns with higher concentration
            near sources of dust generation.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier accumulation
            due to airflow patterns and electrostatic effects. Top surfaces of horizontal panels accumulate more dust than
            bottom surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas trap dust. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom
            due to gravity. Exposed areas may experience less accumulation due to wind scouring.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, translucent film, slight discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Noticeable layer, obscuring the copper surface, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significant discoloration,
            thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup, completely obscuring the copper, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on copper presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by earthy tones.
            The texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular feel, depending on humidity and the presence
            of organic matter. Coverage patterns vary widely, influenced by airflow, surface orientation, and the presence
            of moisture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (perimeter of panels), point source spreading (radial pattern from vents), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized
            concentrations (crevices, corners). Uniform coating is rare; patchy/spotty and streaky/linear are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            charge concentration. The perimeter of panels often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the center
            areas. This is due to the edges acting as barriers to airflow, causing dust particles to deposit more readily.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection
            points. Contours influence airflow and deposition patterns. Depressions fill with dust. Gaps can be bridged by
            dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Dust
            hangs from overhead surfaces in sheltered environments. Settling velocity of dust particles varies with size and
            density, influencing the rate of deposition.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. The presence of oily or organic contaminants
            can create a slight sheen. Iridescence is rare but possible if the dust layer contains very fine, layered particles
            with specific refractive indices.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery when dry, becoming slightly sticky or crusty when exposed to moisture.
            At higher magnification (100x-500x), individual dust particles are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer soot particles
            to larger (10-50 μm) mineral grains. Organic matter can create a slightly greasy or tacky feel. In areas with
            high humidity, a fine crystalline structure may develop due to the precipitation of dissolved salts.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 100-500
            μm or more in areas of high accumulation. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several millimeters, resembling
            a thin crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            thin films (horizontal surfaces), thick crusts (areas with high humidity and salt deposition), discrete patches
            (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual particle deposition), stains (interaction with copper corrosion),
            uniform coatings (rare, horizontal surfaces), buildups (corners, crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and
            the presence of moisture. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        crown glass:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, light-colored, relatively uniform film. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Darker, thicker, more uneven. Color shifts towards yellow-brown or gray. Texture becomes rougher
            and more consolidated. May exhibit staining due to chemical reactions with the glass surface.'
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours). Begins at contact points (edges, corners) then spreads (days).
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in stable environments. Point sources expand outward (days/weeks). Layering
            effects occur with seasonal variations (months). Thickness increases over time, with consolidation and chemical
            reactions occurring over months/years.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Yellowish-brown (#A0785A), Rust-tinged
            brown (#B7410E with a muted tone), Dark gray with soot (#4A4A4A), Whitish-gray from calcium carbonate (#F0F0F0).'
          common_patterns: Non-uniform coating is most common. Accumulation at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Patchy distribution on horizontal surfaces
            due to settling and wind patterns.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavy concentration: Edges, corners, crevices, sheltered areas, bottom edges of vertical
            surfaces. Light concentration: Center areas of flat surfaces, exposed areas subject to wind or rain. Top vs. bottom:
            Bottom edges of vertical surfaces tend to have higher concentrations due to gravity and water runoff.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible haze (thickness < 1 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable haze, slight reduction in transparency (thickness 1-10 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Visible coating, significant
            reduction in transparency (thickness 10-30 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Opaque or semi-opaque coating, significant obscuration
            (thickness 30-75 μm). Extreme (>85%): Nearly opaque, thick crust, significant obscuration (thickness >75 μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on crown glass typically appears as a hazy, light-brown to grayish coating. The
            texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly gritty film, depending on the particle size and composition. Coverage
            varies from sparse speckling to a nearly opaque layer, often accumulating at edges and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Most common: Edge accumulation, point source spreading (e.g., from a vent), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution on horizontal surfaces, streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. Uniform coating is rare unless the environment is exceptionally
            dusty and stable.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
            Center areas tend to have lower concentrations unless there is a localized dust source in the center. Uniform
            distribution is rare.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Pools
            on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff. Collects
            at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow patterns. Fills depressions and surface imperfections.
          gravity_influence: Significant downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Settling on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker accumulations. Runs down
            slopes, creating streaks and uneven coatings.
          lighting_effects: 'Direct sunlight: Dust layer appears more visible due to increased scattering. May exhibit a slight
            matte finish. Indoor fluorescent: Dust layer may appear less prominent, but still reduces transparency. No significant
            sheen or iridescence unless specific contaminants are present (e.g., metallic particles).'
          texture_details: Feels powdery or slightly gritty to the touch. Microscopic examination reveals a mixture of fine
            particles (sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers) and larger, irregularly shaped aggregates. Can be smooth when
            freshly deposited but becomes rougher with age due to particle agglomeration and chemical reactions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 100 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, can reach up
            to 500 μm in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces), thin films (initial deposition),
            thick crusts (long-term accumulation in sheltered areas), discrete patches (localized sources), spots/dots (individual
            particles), stains (chemical reactions), buildups (edges and corners).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is most common. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation,
            electrostatic charge, and the presence of localized dust sources. Perfectly uniform distribution is extremely
            rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations can occur in controlled environments.
        dolomite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (shifting towards darker browns and grays), and more
            resistant to removal. The thickness increases, and the texture can become crustier due to the binding action of
            moisture and organic matter.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points and edges then spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces. Point sources expand outward over time (weeks/months). Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates (months/years).
          color_variations: Fresh dust often appears as a light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) due to the presence of calcium carbonate.
            As it ages and absorbs moisture and organic matter, it shifts towards a muted brown (#A67B5B), sometimes with
            reddish-brown patches (#8B4513) where iron oxides are concentrated. Soot contributes to darker gray or black areas
            (#36454F). Pollen can add a yellowish tint (#FAFAD2) during certain seasons.
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with preferential accumulation in sheltered areas,
            crevices, and along edges. Streaks and drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Point source spreading is observed around localized emission
            sources.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical walls. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to rainfall may have lower concentrations
            than sheltered undersides. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. A gradient of decreasing
            concentration is observed away from point sources.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible dusting, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): faint discoloration,
            5-20 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable discoloration, 20-50 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): significant
            buildup, 50-200 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): thick, obscuring layer, >200 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on dolomite presents as a fine, particulate layer, typically exhibiting a range
            of earthy tones. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance. Coverage
            varies from a light dusting to a significant buildup depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (common), point source spreading
            (around vents or chimneys), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due
            to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform
            coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and increased
            surface area for particle impaction. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
            This edge accumulation is a dominant characteristic.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as collection points. Depressions and pits fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Dust hangs from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas. Settling velocity of dust particles varies depending on
            size and density, but larger particles settle faster.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and textural irregularities. The presence of soot can create
            darker, less reflective areas. No significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry. When damp, it can become slightly sticky
            or crusty. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of particle sizes, from sub-micrometer soot to larger
            grains of silica and calcite. It feels gritty to the touch, especially with heavier accumulations.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly dusted areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm or even up to 1 mm in sheltered crevices and areas with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas), discrete patches (due to uneven deposition),
            spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), and buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, airflow patterns, and the
            presence of localized emission sources.
        dysprosium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adhering more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation
            and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time, potentially forming a visible crust.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward (weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point
            sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            brown (#A68B64) to a darker, slightly reddish-brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide content. Soot presence can shift
            the color towards a dark gray (#4A4A4A) or black (#000000). Pollen can introduce yellow or orange hues.'
          common_patterns: The dust typically forms a non-uniform coating, with localized spots and streaks. Accumulation
            is most pronounced in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Drip marks may be visible on vertical
            surfaces, indicating the flow of water-borne dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to airflow and gravitational
            settling. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas (e.g., undersides)
            may have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Top surfaces may have less dust due to rain washing.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Patchy coverage, surface
            color still dominant, thickness <5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, surface color partially obscured,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant dust buildup, surface color largely obscured, thickness 25-100
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, continuous dust layer, surface color completely obscured, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Dysprosium typically presents as a matte, grayish-brown layer. The dust layer
            is often uneven, with variations in color and thickness depending on exposure and surface orientation. It tends
            to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating darker, more concentrated deposits.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (common),
            point source spreading (if a specific source is nearby), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (very common), streaky/linear (due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to airflow patterns that concentrate particles near boundaries and the reduced likelihood of removal by wind or
            rain in these areas. Center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. It
            builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection points, and
            dust tends to follow contours of the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the lack of adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The presence of soot can create a slightly darker, less
            reflective surface. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch due to
            the presence of silica and alumina particles. Depending on humidity, it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
            At higher magnification, individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a buildup of
            50-200 μm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches (random deposition), spots/dots
            (individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, airflow patterns, electrostatic charge,
            and the presence of localized sources of contamination.
        ebony:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts from light gray
            to darker gray-brown, and the texture becomes slightly crustier. Thickness increases over time, especially in
            areas of accumulation.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Accumulation begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward over days. Layering effects become visible over weeks/months, with seasonal variations in dust
            composition and thickness.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Medium gray-brown
            (#8B4513) with rust-orange tinges (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to almost
            black (#222222). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-gray (#C0C0C0) with subtle green undertones (#8FBC8F).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to gravity and electrostatic
            attraction. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces exhibit a more uniform
            coating, though often with variations in thickness.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier along edges and in crevices compared to the center
            of flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal areas tend to accumulate more dust than undersides. Vertical surfaces
            show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than
            exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very light dusting, barely noticeable, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film, ebony color still dominant, thickness 5-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Grayish-brown film, ebony color partially
            obscured, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, ebony color significantly obscured, thickness 50-100
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring layer, ebony color barely visible, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on ebony typically appears as a matte, grayish-brown film that obscures the underlying
            deep black surface. The dust layer tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a subtle contrast
            in texture and color. The overall effect is a dulling of the ebony's natural luster.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (along borders and raised features), point source spreading (radiating from a specific source of contamination),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity), and localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced airflow
            and electrostatic attraction. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
            This is due to the edges acting as barriers and trapping particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection points,
            and the dust follows contours of the ebony surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common. Pooling occurs
            at bottom edges. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses light, reducing the ebony's natural
            shine. Indoor fluorescent lighting highlights the grayish tones of the dust. No significant sheen or iridescence
            is typically observed unless specific metallic particles are present in the dust.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch. Under
            magnification (10x-20x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. Depending on humidity,
            the dust can become slightly sticky or form a thin crust.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm in lightly dusted areas to a heavier buildup
            of 50-200 μm in crevices and along edges. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 0.5 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on flat surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity), discrete patches (due to
            localized contamination sources), and stains (where dust has interacted with moisture and the ebony surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on the environment and surface orientation. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to have a mostly uniform distribution with minor variations in thickness. Vertical surfaces are
            typically moderately patchy due to gravitational effects and airflow patterns. Crevices and edges exhibit highly
            variable/irregular concentrations.
        epoxy resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, it becomes more compacted
            and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation of organic matter and iron compounds.
            Thickness increases gradually, and the texture becomes rougher as larger particles accumulate.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens gradually
            over time, with particles adhering to the initial layer. Accumulation often begins at contact points and edges,
            then spreads inward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates. This process can take hours for a barely visible layer, days for a light coating, and months for a significant
            buildup.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Light Tan (#E8DAB2) with a slight grey undertone due to silica. 2. Lightly Soiled:
            Beige (#F5F5DC) with subtle mottling. 3. Moderately Soiled: Dusty Rose (#BC8F8F) due to iron oxide. 4. Heavily
            Soiled: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with darker brown patches. 5. Aged: Dark Brown (#654321) with possible black soot
            inclusions.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include a general coating over horizontal surfaces, accumulation in crevices and
            along edges, and streaks or drip marks on vertical surfaces. Areas sheltered from direct airflow tend to accumulate
            more dust. Point source contamination can lead to radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to direct airflow may have less dust
            than bottom surfaces. Corners and areas with complex geometry tend to have the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and a very thin, barely visible film. Thickness: <1
            μm. 2. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer that slightly obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 1-5 μm.
            3. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that partially obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. 4.
            Heavy (60-85%): A thick layer that significantly obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 20-50 μm. 5. Extreme
            (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer that completely covers the underlying surface. Thickness: >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on epoxy resin composites typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with
            a dominant color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The distribution
            is often uneven, influenced by surface geometry and airflow, leading to variations in thickness and color intensity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2. Edge
            accumulation due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. 3. Point source spreading from localized contamination
            events. 4. Gradient from source, decreasing concentration with distance. 5. Patchy/spotty distribution due to
            uneven deposition and surface irregularities. 6. Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity and
            water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The perimeter of a surface often shows a higher concentration of dust compared to the center.
            This is especially noticeable on horizontal surfaces and around raised features.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling depressions and following contours. On flat areas, it tends to pool and form
            a more uniform layer. On vertical surfaces, it drips and streaks downwards due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer.
            Runs down slopes are observed, and dust can hang from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and uneven distribution. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly gritty and compacted
            as it ages. It feels dry to the touch unless moisture is present, in which case it can become slightly sticky.
            At a microscopic level, individual particles of varying sizes are visible, creating a heterogeneous surface.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light contamination to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm or more in sheltered areas. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of several millimeters in areas with prolonged
            exposure and minimal cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films on smooth surfaces. 2. Thick crusts in areas with
            prolonged exposure and moisture. 3. Discrete patches where dust has settled and adhered. 4. Spots/dots from individual
            particle deposition. 5. Stains from dissolved contaminants. 6. Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces.
            7. Buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface geometry, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of localized contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        europium:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Light, powdery, easily disturbed. Aged contamination (months/years):
            Darker, more compacted, potentially hardened or cemented. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays. Thickness
            increases, and the dust becomes more difficult to remove. Potential for staining of the Europium surface.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns (days/weeks). Layering effects can occur due
            to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Darker grayish-brown (#796939),
            sometimes with reddish-brown tinges (#A0785A) due to iron oxide. Areas with organic matter may exhibit a greenish-brown
            hue (#8F9779). Soot presence can darken the dust to almost black (#212121).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Streaks and
            drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer, while areas
            exposed to airflow may have less dust buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and depressions act as collection points. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less dust due to wind or cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin film (1-5 μm), slight discoloration. Light
            (10-30%): A noticeable but thin layer (5-15 μm), slight dulling of the Europium surface. Moderate (30-60%): A
            visible layer (15-50 μm), obscuring some of the Europium''s original surface. Heavy (60-85%): A thick layer (50-100
            μm), significantly obscuring the Europium surface. Extreme (>85%): A very thick layer (100-200+ μm), almost completely
            obscuring the Europium surface, potential for crust formation.'
          description: Environmental dust on Europium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant grayish-tan
            color. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a slightly
            textured surface. Over time, the dust can become more compacted and darker in color.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in sheltered
            environments), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns), point source spreading
            (from localized contamination sources), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the
            source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water
            runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. While the center areas can also
            accumulate dust, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges, especially in areas with airflow.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, filling depressions. On flat areas, it pools and forms a more uniform layer. On vertical surfaces,
            it drips and forms streaks. It collects at edges due to surface tension and electrostatic forces. It follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the Europium surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient of dust concentration. Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces;
            it will eventually detach due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The presence of soot can create darker, less reflective areas.
            No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are expected.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly abrasive. With moisture and time, it can become
            sticky or crusty. At a microscopic level, individual particles of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and CaCO₃ are visible, creating
            a granular texture. Organic particulates and pollen add a softer, less abrasive component. Soot contributes to
            a fine, almost velvety feel when dry.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (sparse coverage) to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm (extreme coverage). In extreme cases, buildup in crevices can reach up to 500 μm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete patches (due
            to localized contamination), spots/dots (from airborne particles), stains (if the dust contains corrosive components),
            uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of localized
            contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces in enclosed environments tend to have the most uniform distribution.
        fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination becomes darker,
            more compacted, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker grays and browns. Thickness increases, and the
            texture becomes more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days
            and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur
            due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Significant buildup can occur within months,
            with noticeable changes in color and texture.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust: #A9A9A9 (dark gray), Iron-rich areas: #B7410E (rust-orange),
            Organic-rich areas: #654321 (dark brown), Calcareous areas: #F5F5DC (beige).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges. Streaking occurs on vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage. Point source spreading is common
            near vents or openings.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than center areas. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations.
            Top surfaces of horizontal elements have more dust than bottom surfaces. Exposed areas have less dust than sheltered
            areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy film. Thickness: 5-15 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, but FRPU surface still visible. Thickness:
            15-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage, obscuring FRPU color. Thickness: 50-150 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Thick, obscuring layer. Thickness: >150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on FRPU presents as a fine, matte layer, typically light brown to grayish-tan. Coverage
            varies from sparse speckling to a complete coating, influenced by surface orientation and exposure. The texture
            is generally powdery, with localized variations depending on moisture and settling patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation along
            perimeters, point source spreading from vents, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff,
            patchy/spotty distribution in sheltered areas, and gradient from source (e.g., decreasing concentration with distance
            from a vent).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. The center areas tend to have a more uniform,
            but often thinner, coating. This behavior is consistent across various FRPU geometries.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. It
            builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection points. The
            dust follows contours and fills depressions. These effects are due to a combination of airflow patterns, gravity,
            and surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs on vertical surfaces. Dust pools at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Dust does not typically hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture
            or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            highlights variations in color and texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine, like talc. With moisture, it becomes slightly sticky or forms a thin
            crust. Close inspection reveals a granular texture with irregularly shaped particles ranging from 1-50 μm. Feels
            slightly abrasive to the touch.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-25 μm, Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm, Heavy buildup: 100-500 μm. Extreme buildup can
            reach 1 mm or more in sheltered areas.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            runs/streaks caused by water, pools/puddles in depressions, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete patches
            in areas with localized contamination, and stains from organic matter. No crystalline structures are typically
            observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Horizontal surfaces tend to have mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations in thickness. Vertical surfaces are moderately patchy due to gravity and runoff. Crevices
            and edges exhibit highly variable/irregular concentrations. The uniformity level is primarily influenced by wind,
            rain, and surface orientation.
        fiberglass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the fiberglass. Color darkens due to chemical
            reactions and the incorporation of more organic matter. Thickness increases over time, potentially leading to
            a visible crust.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles that adhere to the surface. Over
            time, more particles accumulate, forming a thicker layer. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges,
            corners) and then spreads inward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            deposition rates. The process can take days to months to form a significant layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown (#A0522D)
            to dark brown (#654321) with possible yellow-ochre (#F0E68C) or rust-orange (#B7410E) highlights depending on
            iron oxide content. Soot-heavy areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-green tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, corners, and along edges of the fiberglass structure.
            On vertical surfaces, it forms streaks and drip marks due to gravity and rain. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer, especially in sheltered areas. Wind direction influences accumulation patterns on exposed
            surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
            Corners and areas near dust sources exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top
            to bottom due to gravity and rain runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable film,
            slightly alters surface color, 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, obscures original surface texture,
            20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly alters surface appearance, 50-150 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete
            coverage, forms a crusty or caked layer, >150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on fiberglass typically presents as a matte, particulate layer with a dominant color
            range of light to dark browns and grays, often with reddish or yellowish undertones depending on the local soil
            composition. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns), point source spreading (from nearby construction or industrial activity), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture or localized contamination),
            streaky/linear (due to rain or wind), and localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas may have lower concentrations
            due to wind scouring or rain runoff. The perimeter of the fiberglass structure often exhibits a higher concentration
            than the interior.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer, while vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points, leading to higher concentrations. Depressions and surface imperfections trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a thicker layer due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and
            streaks. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more easily dislodged by wind or vibration.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Areas with higher organic content may exhibit a slight
            sheen when wet. Soot particles absorb light, creating darker, less reflective areas.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry. It can become sticky or slightly crusty
            when exposed to moisture or humidity. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of particle sizes, from
            sub-micrometer soot to larger grains of sand or mineral dust. Feels gritty to the touch.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly depending on exposure and time. Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup:
            25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100-500 μm, potentially exceeding 1 mm in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure), discrete patches
            (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            and buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface geometry, airflow patterns, electrostatic charge, and
            the proximity to dust sources. Sheltered horizontal surfaces may exhibit more uniform coverage than exposed vertical
            surfaces.
        fir:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation
            of iron compounds and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time, and the texture can
            become more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, the film thickens and becomes more visible. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces.
            Over months, the dust layer becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly. Seasonal variations in humidity
            and precipitation can influence the rate of buildup and the texture of the dust layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E9DAC1), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0785A), Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich dust: Rust-Orange (#B7410E), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-Tan (#DBC18E)'
          common_patterns: 'Accumulation is often non-uniform. Common patterns include: edge accumulation along board edges
            and grooves, streaking on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff, localized spots around point sources of contamination
            (e.g., bird droppings), and heavier deposits on horizontal surfaces.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravitational settling. Edges and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to airflow patterns and
            electrostatic attraction. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
            Corners can accumulate significant amounts of dust.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-10 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            layer, surface texture still visible, 10-50 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, partially obscuring
            surface texture, 50-200 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage, surface texture largely obscured,
            200-500 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick layer, surface texture completely obscured, >500 μm
            thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on fir presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by earth tones ranging
            from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture varies from fine powdery deposits to slightly crusty accumulations,
            depending on humidity and the presence of organic binders. Coverage patterns are influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, leading to uneven distribution.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (common), point source spreading (common near sources of contamination), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (common), streaky/linear (common on vertical surfaces),
            localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. This effect is particularly
            pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than sloped surfaces. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions
            and indentations fill with dust over time. The dust layer generally follows the contours of the fir surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges. Runs develop down slopes. Overhead surfaces tend to accumulate less dust than upward-facing surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly brighter and more reflective, especially
            if it contains crystalline particles (e.g., silica). Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance,
            reducing contrast and highlighting the matte finish. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine, with individual particles ranging from 1-10 μm. With
            increased humidity or the presence of organic matter (e.g., pollen, sap), it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
            Close inspection reveals a granular texture, with visible variations in particle size and shape. The surface is
            generally matte.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Thin film: 1-25 μm. Light buildup: 25-100 μm. Moderate buildup:
            100-500 μm. Heavy buildup: 500 μm - 2 mm. Extreme buildup can exceed 2 mm in sheltered areas.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high humidity and organic matter), discrete
            patches (around point sources), spots/dots (individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in sheltered areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: 'Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Factors affecting
            uniformity include: airflow patterns, surface orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), proximity to contamination
            sources, and the presence of surface irregularities (knots, grain patterns).'
        float glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more deeply embedded, potentially reacting with surface moisture to form a harder,
            more adherent layer. Color shifts towards darker shades of brown or gray due to oxidation and the accumulation
            of organic matter. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes noticeably rougher.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens gradually (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is common indoors.
            Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g.,
            pollen in spring). The initial film is often barely perceptible, becoming more noticeable over days and weeks.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray-beige (#D3D0CB), Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C), Industrial dust (Fe-rich):
            Reddish-brown (#A0522D), Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32, subtle
            tint).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating (especially on horizontal surfaces), localized spots near
            point sources (e.g., vents), streaks on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation, and accumulation along
            edges and crevices. Drip marks are frequently observed on exterior surfaces. Electrostatic attraction can cause
            dust to cling more strongly to certain areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges tend to be heavier due to electrostatic attraction
            and air currents. Top vs. bottom depends on surface orientation and cleaning frequency. Corners and crevices accumulate
            more dust due to reduced airflow. Flat surfaces generally have more uniform coverage than textured surfaces. Vertical
            walls exhibit streaking due to gravity and rain. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust due to settling. Exposed
            areas receive more dust than sheltered areas. Gradient patterns are common near dust sources.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, slight haze, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film, slightly reduces transparency, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Clearly visible coating, reduces transparency
            significantly, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque coating, significantly reduces visibility, thickness
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost completely opaque, very poor visibility, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on float glass presents as a fine, often uneven layer, typically ranging from light
            tan to reddish-brown. The texture varies from a barely perceptible film to a slightly gritty coating, depending
            on the dust composition and accumulation time. Coverage patterns are influenced by air currents, surface orientation,
            and electrostatic forces, leading to variations in thickness and density across the glass surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (indoor, low-traffic areas), edge
            accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and air currents), point source spreading (near vents or construction
            sites), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven surfaces, condensation),
            streaky/linear (rain or cleaning), localized concentrations (crevices, corners), radial patterns (around droplets).
            Uniform coating and edge accumulation are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and air
            currents. The mechanism is a combination of increased surface charge density at edges and the tendency of air
            currents to deposit particles along boundaries. This effect is more pronounced on larger glass surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            attraction. It pools on flat areas, especially when mixed with moisture. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Dust collects at edges due to electrostatic forces. It follows contours to some extent. It rarely bridges
            gaps unless bound by moisture or sticky substances. It fills depressions, leading to uneven surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, leading to pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common result. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are observed. Dust rarely hangs from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or adhesive substances.
            The settling velocity of dust particles is typically slow enough that air currents are a more dominant factor
            than gravity for smaller particles (<10 μm).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer can appear slightly matte, reducing the glass's reflectivity.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the dust distribution. A thin layer may exhibit
            a slight haze. Oily components within the dust can create a subtle sheen. Iridescence or rainbow effects are not
            typically observed unless there is a significant presence of specific pollutants (e.g., oil films).
          texture_details: Texture ranges from smooth (barely perceptible) to slightly rough, depending on particle size and
            composition. Feels powdery when dry, potentially sticky or crusty if exposed to moisture or oily contaminants.
            Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous mix of fine particles, with occasional larger grains of sand or
            organic matter. No inherent crystalline structure is typically observed without specific chemical reactions.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 100 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, particularly
            in industrial environments, buildup can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (rain or condensation),
            thin films (uniform deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup, moisture interaction), discrete patches (uneven surfaces),
            spots/dots (condensation nuclei), stains (chemical reactions), uniform coatings (indoor environments), buildups
            (edges, corners). Drip marks and thin films are the most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor
            variations is common indoors. Moderately patchy is typical outdoors. Highly variable/irregular occurs near point
            sources or in areas with significant air turbulence. The uniformity level is primarily determined by air currents,
            surface orientation, and the presence of localized dust sources.
        fused silica:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adheres more strongly to the surface, and exhibits darker, more
            saturated colors due to chemical reactions and the incorporation of more organic matter. Thickness also increases
            over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days and weeks. It often begins at
            contact points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments.
            Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition and
            concentration. Months/years lead to significant crusting and discoloration.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones (#F0E68C). Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted brownish-orange (#A0522D) to a reddish-brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide content. Soot-rich areas: Dark
            gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating (especially in controlled environments), localized spots
            from point sources, streaks caused by airflow or water runoff, and accumulation along edges and in low-lying areas.
            Fingerprints leave distinct oily residue patterns that attract more dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to settling. Crevices and low-lying
            areas trap dust. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more
            than vertical.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a light haze. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A faint,
            uneven coating. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring some surface details. Thickness:
            5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer, significantly obscuring the surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on fused silica typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a color range from
            light gray to brownish-orange, depending on the composition and age of the dust. It tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often concentrating along edges and in crevices, creating a slightly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (very common),
            point source spreading (common near vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (common in uncontrolled environments), streaky/linear (due to airflow or water), localized concentrations
            (in crevices), and radial patterns (around point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The perimeter of the fused silica will often have a higher concentration of dust than the center.
            This is due to the edge effect, where the electric field is stronger at sharp corners and edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. It builds
            up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to
            electrostatic attraction. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom,
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces more readily than vertical surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are common. Overhead surfaces tend to accumulate less dust unless there is significant upward airflow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution and subtle color variations. A thin layer may exhibit a slight haze or bloom
            effect. Thicker layers appear more opaque.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            With heavier accumulation, it can form a more cohesive, almost crusty layer. Microscopic examination reveals irregular
            particle shapes and sizes.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. Extreme cases in neglected environments can reach up to 1-2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial stage), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized sources), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (from liquid contaminants), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (at edges), drip marks (from water runoff), and runs/streaks (from airflow).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor
            variations is possible in cleanrooms. Moderately patchy is common in typical industrial settings. Highly variable/irregular
            is typical outdoors. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of localized sources.
        gallium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time, the dust layer thickens
            and becomes more visible. Color darkens due to oxidation and the accumulation of more particles. Aged dust can
            become slightly compacted and harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Dust buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and contact points. It then
            thickens gradually over time, with particles accumulating on top of each other. Point sources, such as ventilation
            outlets, expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to changes in dust composition or environmental conditions.
            Seasonal variations in pollen and other organic particulates can influence the color and texture of the dust layer.
            Timeframe: Initial film within hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant accumulation within weeks/months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow. Aged dust (days): Pale yellowish-brown
            (#C2B280). Aged dust (weeks): Reddish-brown (#A0785A) due to iron oxide. Soot-rich dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to
            black (#000000). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32) tinge.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges. On vertical surfaces, streaks
            and drip marks are common. Flat, horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage. Areas near ventilation sources
            or openings show higher concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic effects and
            airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal gallium pieces accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Crevices
            and low-lying areas trap dust particles. Exposed areas facing air currents receive higher dust deposition rates.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a light speckling of fine particles, barely visible. Thickness:
            <5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film is visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer
            covers a significant portion of the surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, obscuring layer covers
            most of the surface. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer completely covers the
            surface. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on gallium typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a matte finish.
            The color is usually a muted, earthy tone, ranging from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the composition
            and age of the dust. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a complete, obscuring coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along perimeters, point source spreading from ventilation outlets, gradient from source with decreasing concentration,
            patchy/spotty distribution due to electrostatic attraction, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to
            gravity and airflow.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas tend to have lower concentrations
            unless they are also low-lying or sheltered.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow
            stagnation. Crevices and grooves trap dust particles. Flat areas allow for more uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces
            promote drip marks. Edges act as collection points due to electrostatic charge.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are common. Overhead surfaces accumulate less dust than horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuse, with no significant gloss or
            sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the variations in color and texture more clearly. Soot-rich areas absorb
            light, appearing darker, while lighter-colored dust reflects more light.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch. At
            higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. It is not typically
            sticky unless humidity is high, in which case it can become slightly cohesive.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            from condensation, pools/puddles in low-lying areas, discrete patches due to electrostatic attraction, spots/dots
            from individual particle deposition, stains from liquid contaminants mixed with dust, buildups in sheltered corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the environment and surface orientation. Horizontal
            surfaces in still air tend to have mostly uniform distribution with minor variations. Vertical surfaces and areas
            near air currents exhibit highly variable/irregular distribution. Sheltered areas have concentrated buildup.
        gallium arsenide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly adhered, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic matter decomposition),
            and potentially thicker. The texture can transition from powdery to crusty or even slightly cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It begins at contact points (edges,
            corners) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments, but more
            often it's point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to changes in environmental conditions
            (e.g., seasonal variations in pollen concentration). Significant buildup (visible to the naked eye) can occur
            within days to weeks, while substantial crusting may take months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#F5F5DC) to Pale Yellow (#FFFFE0). Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0522D)
            with darker, almost black (#000000) soot particles. Iron oxide presence can shift the color towards Rust-Orange
            (#B7410E). In areas with high calcium carbonate, a chalky white (#F0F8FF) appearance is possible.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces collect more dust than vertical surfaces. Point sources of contamination (e.g.,
            nearby machinery) can create radial or directional patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and in corners. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            more dust than vertical surfaces. Areas near ventilation systems or machinery tend to have higher concentrations.
            Top surfaces exposed to settling dust have higher concentrations than undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a few scattered particles. Light (10-30%): A thin, faint
            film. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original surface slightly. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            opaque layer. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer, potentially with visible formations like crusts or
            buildups. Thickness ranges from 1-5 μm for sparse, 5-15 μm for light, 15-30 μm for moderate, 30-50 μm for heavy,
            and >50 μm for extreme.'
          description: Environmental dust on Gallium Arsenide typically appears as a fine, uneven layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture is generally powdery, and the distribution is often non-uniform,
            accumulating more at edges and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (electrostatic attraction), point source spreading
            (radial pattern), uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition),
            streaky/linear (airflow influence), localized concentrations (near contamination sources). Edge accumulation and
            patchy/spotty are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The center areas tend to have lower concentrations unless there is a direct source of contamination
            above them. The perimeter of the Gallium Arsenide surface acts as a collection point.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic effects. Flat
            areas allow for settling and buildup. Vertical surfaces experience less accumulation due to gravity. Edges act
            as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling and accumulation. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs down
            the slope.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Soot particles can create dark spots that absorb light. No
            significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly abrasive. Over time, moisture absorption can cause
            caking and a slightly crusty texture. Microscopic examination reveals a mixture of fine particles and larger,
            irregularly shaped agglomerates. The surface is not smooth; it has a granular feel.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 50 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, particularly
            in sheltered areas, buildup can reach 100-200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (early stage), discrete patches (uneven deposition),
            spots/dots (individual particles), stains (liquid-borne contaminants), buildups (accumulation in sheltered areas),
            drip marks (condensation and runoff).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare outside
            of controlled deposition processes. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, electrostatic charge,
            surface roughness, and the distribution of contamination sources.
        gallium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted, darker in color (due to chemical reactions and absorption of pollutants),
            and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the texture can become more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film of individual particles. Over time, these particles
            coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners)
            and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments. Point sources can
            create expanding outward patterns. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            concentration. Timeframes range from hours for initial deposition to months/years for significant buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh dust often exhibits a light gray (#D3D3D3) to beige (#F5F5DC) hue. As it ages and absorbs
            moisture/oils, it can shift towards a light brown (#A68B64), a muted reddish-brown (#8B4513, burnt sienna), or
            even a dark gray (#696969) if soot is prevalent.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, accumulation along edges and corners
            due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Point source contamination
            can lead to radial spreading patterns. In areas with high humidity, watermarks and staining are common.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow stagnation. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Crevices
            and depressions act as collection points. Exposed areas may experience higher dust deposition rates than sheltered
            areas, but sheltered areas may accumulate thicker layers over time due to less frequent cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles or small clusters, barely visible to the naked
            eye. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer that slightly obscures the underlying GaN surface. Typical thickness
            <1 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous layer that noticeably alters the appearance of the GaN surface. Thickness
            1-10 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, nearly opaque layer that significantly obscures the underlying GaN surface.
            Thickness 10-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, opaque layer that completely obscures the underlying GaN surface.
            Thickness >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Gallium Nitride typically appears as a fine, particulate layer with a muted,
            earthy tone. The color is often a blend of light grays and browns, with variations depending on the local environment.
            Coverage can range from sparse speckling to a near-opaque coating, often accumulating at edges and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in low-traffic
            areas), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition),
            streaky/linear (due to airflow or cleaning attempts), localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow
            patterns. The perimeter of the GaN surface acts as a collection point. The center areas may experience lower dust
            deposition rates due to higher airflow velocities. This effect is more pronounced on smaller GaN samples.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces experience drip marks. Edges act as collection points. Contours can influence airflow patterns, leading
            to variations in dust deposition.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks on vertical
            surfaces. Dust tends to pool at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces experience settling
            of dust particles. Runs down slopes are observed. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, especially in areas with
            high humidity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the variations in color and texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed unless oil films are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry. It feels slightly gritty to the touch.
            With increased humidity or the presence of oils, it can become sticky or slightly crusty. At high magnification
            (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular
            mineral fragments, and irregular carbonaceous particles.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of <1 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup of 25-100
            μm or more in areas of prolonged accumulation. Extreme cases in industrial environments can reach thicknesses
            of several millimeters in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water or
            cleaning), thin films (on horizontal surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high humidity or chemical exposure),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles), stains (due to chemical
            reactions), uniform coatings (on sheltered surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the environment. Perfectly uniform distribution is
            rare. Mostly uniform distribution with minor variations is possible in controlled environments. Moderately patchy
            distribution is common in typical industrial settings. Highly variable/irregular distribution is observed in areas
            with complex airflow or localized contamination sources. The uniformity level is primarily determined by airflow
            patterns, electrostatic forces, and the presence of localized contamination sources.
        galvanized steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed powder. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust layer becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the galvanized surface. Color may darken due to
            oxidation of iron particles or the accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the galvanized surface (hours).
            Over days, these particles aggregate and form a more continuous layer. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more
            rapidly than flat surfaces. Over months, the dust layer thickens and becomes more compacted. Seasonal variations
            in dust concentration and humidity influence the rate of buildup. Layering effects may occur due to alternating
            periods of high and low dust deposition.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light Greyish-Tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283), Aged: Medium Brown (#A67B5B), Rust-Tinted: Brownish-Orange
            (#B87333), Soot-Contaminated: Dark Grey (#4A4A4A), Calcareous: Off-White (#F5F5DC)'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from direct rain or
            wind. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby chimney) results in a gradient of decreasing concentration
            with distance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces of horizontal elements tend to accumulate more dust than undersides. Sheltered
            areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Vertical surfaces show a gradient of decreasing concentration from
            top to bottom due to rain washing.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Lightly speckled appearance, galvanized surface mostly visible, thickness
            < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, galvanized surface still largely visible, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, galvanized surface partially obscured, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant
            dust buildup, galvanized surface mostly obscured, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, dense dust layer,
            galvanized surface almost completely obscured, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on galvanized steel presents as a generally matte, light-to-medium brown or greyish-brown
            layer. The texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular feel depending on humidity and composition.
            Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a near-complete coating, often with noticeable accumulation in crevices
            and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (along cut edges and seams), point source spreading (radial pattern from a single source), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to wind or rain), streaky/linear
            (vertical surfaces due to rain runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas tend to have a more uniform
            distribution, but the concentration is generally lower than at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices and
            depressions act as traps for dust particles. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces promote
            dripping and streaking. Edges provide a surface for electrostatic attraction and accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in depressions.
            Runs down slopes are common. Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the relatively low adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal specular reflection. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a slightly dull, muted appearance. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive when dry. Can become sticky or slightly crusty when exposed
            to moisture. Close inspection reveals a fine granular structure with occasional larger particles (e.g., sand grains,
            pollen). The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss unless wet.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with minimal
            cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages of contamination), thick crusts (in areas
            with high humidity and salt content), discrete patches (uneven distribution), spots/dots (individual particles
            or small aggregates), stains (discoloration of the galvanized surface), uniform coatings (horizontal surfaces),
            drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on environmental conditions and surface orientation.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to have mostly uniform distribution with minor variations. Vertical surfaces are typically
            moderately patchy or highly variable due to rain runoff and wind patterns. Sheltered areas exhibit more uniform
            accumulation than exposed areas.
        germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a very light, almost imperceptible film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, thicker, and more noticeable. It may also exhibit signs of consolidation or
            caking, especially in areas exposed to moisture.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and becomes
            more noticeable. Contact points and edges accumulate dust first, then the contamination spreads inward. Layering
            effects can occur due to changes in dust composition over time (e.g., seasonal pollen variations). Months of exposure
            lead to significant buildup, especially in sheltered areas.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grey (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5F5). Aged dust: Light brownish-grey (#A9A9A9),
            sometimes with rust-colored specks (#B7410E) if iron content is high. Soot-rich dust: Dark grey (#4A4A4A) to almost
            black (#000000). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-grey (#C0C0C0).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, accumulation in crevices and corners,
            and streaks or drip marks on vertical surfaces. Dust tends to accumulate more heavily on rougher surfaces compared
            to polished surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces may have less dust
            than bottom surfaces if the source is below.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very light, almost invisible film. Thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            barely visible layer. Thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, slightly obscuring the surface. Thickness
            5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significantly obscuring the surface. Thickness 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Thick, crusty buildup. Thickness >50 μm, potentially up to 1 mm in crevices.'
          description: Environmental dust on germanium typically appears as a fine, matte layer, ranging in color from light
            grey to brownish-grey depending on the composition and age. The texture is generally powdery and the distribution
            is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic forces), point source spreading (from a specific contamination source), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (due to gravity
            and airflow), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow
            patterns. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer. This is especially true for smaller germanium
            components.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs. Overhead surfaces may
            have dust hanging due to electrostatic forces, but gravity eventually causes it to fall.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the uneven distribution and variations in color more clearly. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow
            effect unless oil contamination is present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to talcum powder. It feels slightly
            abrasive if rubbed. Under magnification (50x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. In
            humid conditions, it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm or more in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on most surfaces), thick crusts (in areas exposed to
            moisture), discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (from airborne particles), stains (if
            the dust contains soluble components), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices),
            drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and
            the location of contamination sources.
        glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time, the dust layer thickens
            and darkens, becoming more noticeable. Aged dust often exhibits a more consolidated, crusty texture. Color shifts
            towards darker browns and grays due to the accumulation of organic matter and soot. Algae growth can introduce
            green or black staining in humid environments.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates
            at contact points and edges. After weeks, the dust layer thickens and spreads inward from the edges. Months of
            exposure result in a noticeable buildup, with layering effects and seasonal variations (e.g., pollen accumulation
            in spring). In sheltered areas, buildup can continue for years, forming thick crusts.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with slight yellow tint due to pollen. 2. Lightly Soiled: Pale
            Tan (#E9C2A6). 3. Moderately Soiled: Dusty Brown (#A18A70) with reddish-brown (Burnt Sienna, #E97451) near edges.
            4. Heavily Soiled: Dark Grayish Brown (#5C4033) with localized black (#000000) soot deposits. 5. Aged: Mottled
            Gray-Brown (#808080 to #6B4423) with possible green algae staining in humid environments.'
          common_patterns: Non-uniform coating is most common. Accumulation occurs preferentially in crevices, along edges,
            and on horizontal surfaces. Streaks and drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces. Point source spreading is
            observed around localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings).
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly across the surface. Edges and corners tend to have
            the highest concentrations. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Crevices and sheltered
            areas exhibit heavy buildup. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
            Concentration gradients are observed around point sources.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Almost invisible, slight dulling of the surface. Thickness: <1 μm.
            2. Light (10-30%): A thin, barely noticeable film. Thickness: 1-5 μm. 3. Moderate (30-60%): A visible layer of
            dust, slightly altering the surface color. Thickness: 5-25 μm. 4. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily noticeable layer
            of dust, significantly changing the surface color. Thickness: 25-100 μm. 5. Extreme (>85%): A very thick layer
            of dust, obscuring the original surface. Thickness: >100 μm, potentially reaching mm scale in sheltered areas.'
          description: Environmental dust on GFRP typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant color
            range of light grays and browns, often with localized darker patches. The distribution varies significantly based
            on exposure and surface geometry, ranging from a thin, almost invisible film to a noticeable buildup in sheltered
            areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: 1. Edge accumulation: Dust collects along edges
            and corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. 2. Point source spreading: Contamination radiates
            outward from a specific source. 3. Gradient from source: Dust concentration decreases with distance from the source.
            4. Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution due to localized contamination events. 5. Streaky/linear: Vertical streaks
            caused by rainwater runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter of the GFRP structure often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared
            to the center areas. This is especially pronounced in areas with high wind exposure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect more dust than curved surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges and protrusions act as collection points. Depressions
            and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and streaks. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a uniform layer. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in depressions. Runs down slopes are observed. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces,
            forming small stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle variations in color and texture. A slight sheen may be visible on areas with a thin, compacted
            dust layer. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Feels slightly gritty or powdery to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual dust particles
            are visible, creating a rough surface. The texture can range from smooth and fine (thin film) to coarse and crusty
            (heavy buildup). In areas with high humidity, the dust may become slightly sticky or form a thin, hardened crust.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 μm (thin film) to 100-500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films: A uniform layer of dust covering the surface. 2.
            Thick crusts: Hardened layers of dust in sheltered areas. 3. Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by rainwater
            runoff. 4. Discrete patches: Isolated areas of contamination. 5. Stains: Discoloration caused by organic matter
            or pollutants. 6. Buildups: Accumulation of dust in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface geometry, and the location of contamination sources.
            Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        gneiss:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation of iron), and more difficult to
            remove. Thickness increases over time, and lichen or moss may begin to grow within the dust layer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours/days) that gradually thickens (weeks/months). Accumulation
            often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, crevices) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is
            rare; point sources that expand outward are more common. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates. For example, pollen deposition in spring can create a distinct yellow
            layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust: #A07A55 (umber), Iron-rich dust: #B7410E (rust), Soot-heavy
            dust: #36454F (charcoal grey), Pollen-rich dust: #E4D00A (golden yellow cast)'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along grain boundaries, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Streaking is common on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. Edges and corners tend to exhibit heavier buildup
            than flat, exposed areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier along edges and in crevices due to reduced wind exposure
            and increased surface area for particle capture. Top surfaces exposed to rainfall tend to have lower concentrations
            than sheltered undersides. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Corners and areas
            near potential dust sources (e.g., roads, industrial sites) exhibit higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            tan or reddish tint, 10-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct coating, obscuring some of the gneiss''s
            original color, 25-50 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, largely obscuring the gneiss''s original
            color, 50-100 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the gneiss, >100 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on gneiss typically presents as a matte, slightly granular coating, ranging from
            light tan to reddish-brown depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along
            edges, creating a mottled appearance against the gneiss's natural coloration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), crevice filling,
            point source spreading (from bird droppings or industrial emissions), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture), and streaky/linear (due to water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to reduced wind exposure
            and increased surface area for particle impaction. The center areas, especially on flat surfaces, are more susceptible
            to wind and rain erosion, resulting in lower dust concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced wind exposure. Flat areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Depressions and
            pits act as traps for dust particles. Edges and ridges provide increased surface area for particle impaction.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Runs down slopes are common,
            especially during rainfall. Overhead surfaces tend to have less dust accumulation, but some particles may adhere
            electrostatically.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the lighter, tan-colored components of the dust. The presence of organic particulates
            can create a slight sheen in humid conditions.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch, due to the presence of silica
            and alumina particles. At higher magnification (100x), individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) can be
            observed. In humid conditions, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty due to moisture absorption.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a buildup
            of 100-500 μm in heavily contaminated crevices. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas
            over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity), discrete patches (due
            to localized contamination), stains (from organic matter), and buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is disrupted by the gneiss's inherent surface roughness, grain boundaries, and the presence of crevices. Wind
            and water erosion also contribute to uneven distribution.
        gold:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust compacts and adheres more strongly to the gold surface. Color darkens due to oxidation and the incorporation
            of more organic material. Thickness increases gradually, and the texture can become more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate dust faster than center areas. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible but less common. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration.
            Months of exposure lead to thicker, more compacted layers.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to pale tan (#E9C2A6). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown
            (#A0785A) to a darker, slightly orange-tinged brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide content. Soot presence can shift
            colors to grayish-brown (#808080). Pollen can add yellowish-green hues.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform, with preferential deposition in crevices, along edges, and on
            horizontal surfaces. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Point source contamination leads
            to radial spreading patterns. Electrostatic attraction can cause a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and corners often accumulate more dust due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            effects. Crevices and depressions act as traps for dust particles. Exposed areas may experience less accumulation
            due to wind or cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible to the naked eye, thickness
            < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film, slightly obscuring the gold luster, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A noticeable layer, partially obscuring the gold, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, obscuring layer,
            significantly reducing the gold''s reflectivity, thickness 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring
            layer, almost completely hiding the gold surface, thickness > 200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on gold typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan to reddish-brown,
            often obscuring the underlying gold luster. The distribution varies from a thin, nearly invisible film to a thicker,
            patchy accumulation, influenced by surface geometry and airflow patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually due to electrostatic
            effects), edge accumulation (common due to airflow and surface tension), point source spreading (from a specific
            contamination source), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (irregular
            distribution), streaky/linear (due to airflow or cleaning attempts), localized concentrations (in crevices or
            depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Center areas may experience less accumulation due
            to wind or cleaning. However, if the center is a depression, it can also accumulate dust.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat areas tend to collect more dust than angled surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along
            them.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker
            accumulations. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in depressions. Runs down slopes are common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish, diffusing light and reducing the
            gold's reflectivity. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Heavy accumulations
            may show slight iridescence due to thin-film interference, especially if oil or moisture is present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. Depending on humidity and organic content, it
            can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under magnification (100x+), individual particles of varying shapes and
            sizes are visible. Feels slightly abrasive to the touch when heavily accumulated.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) or even a millimeter (1 mm) for heavy, long-term buildup in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water or
            cleaning), pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles or small aggregates), stains (from dissolved
            contaminants), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in sheltered areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on factors such as airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic
            charge, and the presence of localized contamination sources.
        gorilla glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time, it becomes more compacted
            and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to the accumulation of organic matter and the oxidation
            of metallic components (e.g., iron). Thickness increases, and the texture can become crustier.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin film of individual particles. Begins at contact points (edges, scratches)
            and spreads outward. Uniform gradual accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward in a radial
            pattern. Layering effects occur with alternating wet/dry cycles. Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration
            influence the buildup rate. Timeframes: Visible film within hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant
            accumulation within weeks/months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0C0C0). Aged dust (dry): Pale yellowish-brown (#E3DAC9).
            Aged dust (humid): Darker, slightly reddish-brown (#A68B64). Dust with soot: Grayish-black (#434A54) mixed with
            brown. Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-green tint (#D0D6B5).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially at edges and in crevices. Forms streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity and rain. On horizontal surfaces, it tends to settle as a more uniform layer, often thicker in
            sheltered areas. Point source contamination (e.g., bird droppings) creates radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavier concentration at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and physical
            trapping. Lighter concentration on smooth, exposed surfaces due to wind and rain. Top vs. bottom on vertical surfaces:
            heavier at the bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas have higher concentrations than exposed areas.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and dust particles, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            translucent film, slightly obscuring the surface. Typical thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer,
            partially obscuring the surface. Typical thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant obscuration, color change
            noticeable. Typical thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Near-opaque coating, significantly altering the surface
            appearance. Typical thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Gorilla Glass presents as a fine, often uneven layer, typically appearing in
            shades of light brown to grayish-tan. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly sticky depending on humidity
            and organic content. Coverage varies significantly, from sparse speckling to near-opaque coatings, influenced
            by environmental factors and surface orientation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Most common patterns: Edge accumulation, point source spreading, gradient from source, patchy/spotty,
            streaky/linear. Less common: Uniform coating (only in very controlled environments), radial patterns (around specific
            contamination points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and lower airflow. The
            mechanism is a combination of electrostatic forces attracting charged particles to the edge and reduced airflow
            allowing particles to settle more readily.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. Pools on
            flat areas, especially if slightly inclined. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due
            to electrostatic attraction and surface tension. Fills depressions and scratches.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is significant on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling at bottom edges is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces creates a more uniform layer. Runs
            down slopes, with thicker accumulation at the bottom. Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the relatively
            low adhesion of dry dust.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses light, reducing glare. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights unevenness. A thin layer may exhibit a slight
            sheen, while a thick layer appears dull and opaque. No significant iridescence is typically observed unless oily
            contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty when dry. Can become sticky or slightly oily to the touch when
            humid or mixed with organic residues. Close inspection reveals a fine, granular structure, sometimes with larger
            particles of pollen or soot. Under magnification, individual particles appear angular and irregular.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-5 μm. Light buildup: 5-25 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100-500
            μm. Extreme buildup: >500 μm (approaching 1 mm or more in extreme cases).'
          typical_formations: Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. Thin films on smooth surfaces. Thick crusts
            in areas with repeated wetting and drying. Discrete patches around point sources. Spots/dots from individual dust
            particles. Stains from organic residues. Buildups in corners and crevices.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is most common. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due
            to variations in airflow, surface charge, and the nature of the dust source. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            can occur on horizontal surfaces in sheltered environments. Moderately patchy is typical on vertical surfaces
            exposed to rain.
        granite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable layer. Over time, the dust becomes more
            compacted and adheres more strongly to the granite surface. Color changes occur due to chemical reactions (e.g.,
            oxidation of iron) and the incorporation of organic matter. Aged dust layers can become significantly thicker
            and more difficult to remove, sometimes forming a hard crust.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles that adhere to the granite surface.
            Over time, more particles accumulate, thickening the layer. The process often begins at contact points (e.g.,
            edges, crevices) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces.
            Point sources of pollution create expanding outward patterns. Layering effects can be observed due to seasonal
            variations in dust composition and deposition rates. This process can take hours for a barely visible layer, days
            for a light coating, and months for a significant buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a slight yellowish tint (#FAFAD2). Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0785A) to a darker, sooty gray (#4A4A4A) in areas with high carbon particulate concentration.
            Areas with iron oxide may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Pollen can add a greenish-yellow tint (#ADFF2F)
            during certain seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from direct rain or
            wind. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks or drip marks, while horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more
            uniform layer. Areas near point sources of pollution (e.g., chimneys, roads) show a gradient of dust concentration,
            decreasing with distance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices due to wind-driven accumulation
            and reduced rain exposure. Horizontal surfaces tend to have higher concentrations than vertical surfaces. Top
            surfaces exposed to direct rainfall may have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and depressions
            act as collection points. Areas near pollution sources exhibit higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            light gray or brown tint, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, obscuring the original granite color
            in some areas, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage, largely obscuring the original granite color,
            50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the original granite color, >100 μm
            thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on granite typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light browns and grays, often with reddish or yellowish undertones depending on the local soil
            composition. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating darker, more concentrated areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along raised features. 3) Point source spreading from nearby pollution sources. 4) Gradient from
            source, decreasing dust concentration with distance. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with uneven surface
            texture. 6) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. 7) Localized concentrations
            in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to wind-driven deposition
            and reduced rain exposure. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Center areas may experience more
            uniform deposition but are also more exposed to rain, which can wash away the dust. The distribution is often
            a combination of edge accumulation and patchy coverage in the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and the trapping of particles.
            Flat areas allow for uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            causing dust to accumulate. Depressions and pits collect dust particles. The dust layer tends to follow the contours
            of the granite surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles and rainwater, resulting in pooling at bottom
            edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence.
            Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Runs down slopes are observed. Dust can hang from overhead
            surfaces in sheltered areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. The color is more vibrant
            and the texture more pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the dust appears duller and the color less
            saturated. Areas with organic matter may exhibit a slight sheen when wet. Soot particles can create a subtle darkening
            effect.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At a microscopic level, individual
            dust particles are visible, creating a granular surface. In areas with moisture, the dust can become slightly
            sticky or form a thin crust. The texture varies depending on the particle size distribution, with finer particles
            resulting in a smoother feel.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in areas with minimal accumulation to a heavy
            buildup of 100-500 μm or even 1-2 mm in sheltered crevices or areas with prolonged exposure to dust sources.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas. 3) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4) Runs/streaks caused by rainwater. 5) Discrete patches in areas with
            uneven texture. 6) Spots/dots from individual dust particles. 7) Stains caused by dissolved minerals in rainwater.
            8) Buildups in crevices and corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in surface texture, wind exposure, and proximity to dust sources. Uniformity
            is higher on smooth, horizontal surfaces sheltered from wind and rain. Irregularities are caused by surface imperfections
            and localized deposition patterns.
        hafnium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color, and more difficult to remove. The thickness increases,
            and the dust may become encrusted or cemented onto the surface due to chemical reactions with the Hafnium oxide
            layer or the absorption of moisture and pollutants.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks. Dust often begins at contact points and edges before spreading inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible in sheltered environments. Point sources can expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur
            due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup can occur within months
            in heavily polluted environments.
          color_variations: The color range varies depending on the dust composition and age. Fresh dust may appear as a light
            grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) due to the presence of silica and alumina. As it ages and absorbs moisture and organic matter,
            it can shift towards a muted brown (#A68B64), a reddish-brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide, or even a dark gray
            (#36454F) if soot is prevalent. Pollen can add a yellowish tint (#FAFAD2).
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. On flat surfaces, it may form a relatively uniform coating, although variations in surface roughness
            can lead to localized concentrations. Streaks and drip marks can occur on vertical surfaces due to moisture and
            gravity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where dust particles are trapped.
            Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered areas also exhibit
            higher concentrations. Vertical walls tend to have lighter concentrations except where streaking occurs due to
            water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, obscuring some surface details, thickness
            5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous dust layer, obscuring most surface details, thickness 20-100 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, encrusted dust layer, completely obscuring the surface, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Hafnium typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a muted, earthy
            tone. The dust layer often exhibits a slightly rough texture and tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges,
            creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to variations in surface roughness),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, but this depends on the specific geometry and environmental conditions.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            attraction. It pools on flat areas, especially if moisture is present. Drips occur on vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Dust collects at edges due to electrostatic forces. It may follow contours and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are also observed. Dust does not typically hang from overhead surfaces unless bound
            by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. The presence of metallic particles (e.g.,
            iron oxide) can create a subtle sheen in certain areas. Iridescence is not typically observed unless there is
            a very thin film of oil or other contaminant present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At a microscopic level, individual
            dust particles can be observed, creating a granular surface. The presence of organic matter can make the dust
            slightly sticky or clumpy, while the presence of crystalline components (e.g., calcium carbonate) can impart a
            slightly gritty feel.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup of
            50-200 μm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of several
            millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high
            moisture and pollutant levels), discrete patches (due to localized contamination sources), spots/dots (individual
            dust particles), stains (caused by chemical reactions), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), buildups (at edges
            and in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in airflow, surface roughness, and electrostatic charge. The uniformity
            level is primarily influenced by the environmental conditions and the surface characteristics of the Hafnium.
        hastelloy:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation of iron compounds and accumulation
            of soot), and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the texture may become slightly crustier
            due to the binding effect of moisture and organic matter.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges. Over weeks, the dust layer thickens and spreads inward from the edges. Over months, the dust
            becomes more consolidated and may exhibit layering effects due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            deposition rates.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DDCB) with subtle gray undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown
            (#A0522D, Sienna) to dark brown (#654321, Dark Brown) with possible localized patches of near-black (#000000)
            soot. Areas with high CaCO₃ content may appear off-white (#F8F8FF). Pollen can add yellow/green hues (#9ACD32,
            YellowGreen).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. It also tends to concentrate
            along edges, in crevices, and around any surface imperfections. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical
            surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas
            exhibit the highest concentrations. Top surfaces of equipment tend to have more dust than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A faint, patchy film. Thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original surface
            color. Thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily disturbed layer. Thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            A very thick, consolidated layer. Thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Hastelloy typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color range
            of light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and
            on horizontal surfaces, creating a slightly textured appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along perimeters, point source spreading from vents or openings, gradient from source (thicker near the source,
            thinner further away), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, and streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces caused by water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Edges act as barriers, trapping particles carried by the wind. The center of flat surfaces tends to
            have less accumulation due to higher wind speeds and less surface roughness.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat
            areas allow for settling and accumulation. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and indentations act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow of dust
            particles, pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, settling on horizontal
            surfaces, and runs down slopes. The settling velocity of dust particles in air is typically in the range of 0.01-0.1
            m/s, influencing the rate of accumulation on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the variations in color and texture. Soot particles can create localized areas of
            increased light absorption, appearing darker. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it can easily be brushed
            away. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under magnification (100x), individual particles
            of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and amorphous
            carbonaceous material.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to a buildup of 50-200 μm for
            heavy accumulation. In extreme cases, particularly in sheltered areas, the dust layer can reach thicknesses of
            up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on most surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools/puddles
            of dust in depressions, thick crusts in areas with repeated wetting and drying, discrete patches where dust has
            been disturbed and redeposited, and stains where moisture has dissolved and redeposited soluble components.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due
            to variations in airflow, surface orientation, and proximity to dust sources. Uniformity is higher on sheltered
            horizontal surfaces and lower on exposed vertical surfaces.
        hickory:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to chemical
            reactions and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases, and the dust may become slightly cemented
            or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates in grain
            depressions and along edges. After weeks, a more uniform layer develops on horizontal surfaces. Months of accumulation
            lead to thicker deposits, especially in sheltered areas, with potential layering effects from seasonal variations
            in dust composition (e.g., pollen spikes in spring).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C) with slight gray undertones. Aged dust: Shifts towards a muted
            grayish-brown (#808069) or even a reddish-brown (#A0522D) if iron oxide is prevalent. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray
            to black (#36454F). Pollen concentration: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in the recessed grain of the hickory, creating a striped or striated
            appearance. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, while vertical surfaces show streaking due to gravity
            and water runoff. Edges and corners tend to accumulate thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of a surface. Crevices and grain depressions exhibit
            higher concentrations than smooth, raised areas. Top surfaces exposed to settling dust will have higher concentrations
            than undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, primarily in grain depressions. Thickness: <10
            μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, noticeable film that slightly dulls the surface. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A more pronounced layer that obscures the wood grain slightly. Thickness: 50-150 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            easily visible layer that significantly obscures the wood grain. Thickness: 150-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, obscuring layer that may exhibit crusting or caking. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on hickory presents as a fine, matte layer, typically exhibiting a light tan to
            grayish-brown coloration. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along the grain, creating subtle tonal
            variations across the wood surface. Coverage ranges from sparse to heavy depending on exposure and cleaning frequency.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along corners and edges, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., a nearby vent), streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, and localized concentrations in crevices and grain depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in grain depressions on Hickory.
            This is due to electrostatic attraction, reduced airflow at edges, and the trapping of particles in surface irregularities.
            The center areas of smooth surfaces tend to have lower concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices and
            grain depressions trap dust particles. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces experience dripping
            and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate behind them.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform coating. Pooling occurs at bottom edges
            and in depressions. Overhanging surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs downwards in loose clumps.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to flatten the appearance, reducing contrast and making the dust appear more uniformly distributed.
            The presence of soot can create subtle variations in light absorption.
          texture_details: The dust layer feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch due to the presence of silica and
            other mineral particles. At a microscopic level, individual particles are angular and irregular. The dust conforms
            to the underlying wood grain, accentuating its texture rather than masking it completely.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 250 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, particularly
            in sheltered areas, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            discrete patches in sheltered areas, buildups along edges and corners, and stains where moisture has dissolved
            and redeposited contaminants. In humid environments, the dust can form a slightly sticky or crusty layer.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. Uniformity is affected by air currents,
            surface orientation, and the presence of surface irregularities. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than
            vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        inconel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adheres more strongly to the surface, and often develops a darker,
            more reddish-brown color due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more
            crusty and less powdery.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources,
            such as nearby construction, can lead to expanding outward patterns. Layering effects can be observed with seasonal
            variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Months of exposure result in a thicker, more consolidated
            layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C) with subtle gray undertones. Initial iron oxide staining: Yellow-brown
            (#966F33). Moderate accumulation: Reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to increased iron oxide. Aged accumulation: Dark
            brown (#654321) with possible black soot deposits (#000000). Heavily calcified areas: Off-white to light gray
            (#F0F0F0).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks caused by rain or condensation runoff, and accumulation
            in sheltered areas. Edges and crevices tend to collect more dust due to electrostatic attraction and reduced airflow.
            Flat horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, while vertical surfaces show more streaking.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier concentrations at the bottom due to runoff. Sheltered
            areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Corners and sharp angles are prone to significant buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, easily disturbed, 5-15 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, some texture visible, 15-50 μm
            thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, obscuring the underlying surface, 50-100 μm thickness. Extreme
            (>85%): Thick crust, completely covering the surface, >100 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on Inconel typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content and age. It tends to accumulate
            unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: 1) Edge accumulation: Dust concentrates along
            edges and corners. 2) Streaky/linear: Vertical streaks due to water runoff. 3) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution
            across the surface. 4) Localized concentrations: Buildup in crevices and sheltered areas. 5) Uniform coating:
            On horizontal surfaces with minimal disturbance.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner, layer of dust.
            This edge accumulation is a dominant characteristic.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions and pits fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Runs
            develop down slopes. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, forming small stalactite-like structures in extreme
            cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting highlights the uneven distribution and textural variations. Soot deposits can appear slightly more reflective
            than other components. No significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly gritty and crusty with
            age, especially if moisture is present. It feels dry to the touch unless exposed to humidity, in which case it
            can become slightly sticky. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of fine particles with occasional
            larger grains of sand or organic matter.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for fresh dust to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, localized crusts can reach thicknesses of up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: Uniform layers on flat surfaces. 2) Drip marks:
            Vertical streaks caused by water runoff. 3) Crusts: Hardened layers in areas with repeated wetting and drying.
            4) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of dust accumulation. 5) Stains: Discoloration caused by dissolved contaminants.
            6) Buildups: Thick accumulations in crevices and corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the presence of crevices
            or other features that trap dust. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        indium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer with a pale color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color due to oxidation and chemical reactions,
            and more difficult to remove. The thickness also increases over time, and the dust can become slightly hardened
            or crusty.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens gradually
            over time as more particles accumulate. The process often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and
            then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward,
            creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration.
            Timeframes: Visible film within hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant accumulation within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to pale yellow (#FAFAD2). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) to a darker, slightly greyish brown (#8B4513) if soot is present. Areas with higher iron oxide content
            may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Pollen can add a yellowish-green tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces may exhibit streaks
            or drip marks, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas trap
            dust, leading to higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment accumulate more dust than bottom
            surfaces. Areas near potential sources of dust (e.g., vents, machinery) will have higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and patches, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy layer, surface color still dominant. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, partially
            obscuring the surface. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage, surface color largely obscured.
            Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick and potentially crusty. Thickness: >100
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Indium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating
            in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            due to electrostatic forces, point source spreading from localized contamination, gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity and moisture, and localized concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer, unless there is a localized source of contamination in the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. It builds
            up in crevices, filling them over time. It pools on flat areas, creating a more uniform layer. It drips on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity and moisture. It collects at edges, forming a distinct line. It follows contours, conforming
            to the surface shape. It bridges gaps, forming dust "bridges" between surfaces. It fills depressions, leveling
            out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to gravity and moisture. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces,
            creating a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, following the angle of the surface. Dust does not typically hang
            from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. The presence of metallic particles (e.g., iron oxide) can
            create a subtle sheen in certain areas. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine, similar to talcum powder when lightly deposited. Heavier
            accumulations can feel slightly gritty due to the presence of silica and alumina particles. Organic components
            can make the dust slightly sticky, especially in humid conditions. Under magnification, individual particles are
            visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers in size.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, accumulations can reach 1-2 millimeters in crevices
            or sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete
            patches where dust has settled, spots/dots from individual particles, stains from moisture interacting with the
            dust, uniform coatings on horizontal surfaces, buildups in corners and crevices, and drip marks on vertical surfaces.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, electrostatic charge, and
            the source of contamination. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical or complex geometries.
        indium phosphide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a very light, almost imperceptible film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated. The color shifts towards deeper browns and
            reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. The texture becomes more crusty and difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more often it's point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and concentration (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            reddish-brown (#A0522D, Sienna) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2B23) where iron oxide concentration is
            higher. Soot presence can introduce dark gray (#A9A9A9) to black (#000000) specks. Pollen can add a yellowish-green
            tint (#9ACD32) in localized areas.'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with localized spots and streaks. Accumulation is
            most pronounced along edges and in any surface imperfections or crevices. On vertical surfaces, drip marks are
            often visible. Flat, horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            InP samples typically accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered areas also exhibit higher
            concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible to the naked eye, with
            a thickness of <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, uneven film is visible, with a thickness of 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A noticeable layer is present, obscuring the InP surface in some areas, with a thickness of 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            A thick, obscuring layer covers most of the surface, with a thickness of 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick,
            obscuring layer completely covers the surface, with a thickness of >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Indium Phosphide typically presents as a fine, uneven layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices and along edges,
            creating a mottled appearance on the generally smooth, reflective InP surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns), point source spreading (from localized contamination sources), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to
            airflow or cleaning processes), and localized concentrations (in crevices and imperfections). Edge accumulation
            and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have
            lower concentrations unless there is a direct source of contamination in the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            attraction. It pools on flat areas due to gravity settling. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges
            act as collection points. The dust tends to follow contours and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit
            runs. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs precariously.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish, reducing the reflectivity of the
            InP surface. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the uneven distribution and highlights the color variations.
            Depending on the composition and particle size, a slight sheen or iridescence may be observed in areas with a
            thin, uniform dust layer.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a fine, powdery feel when freshly deposited to a slightly crusty or gritty
            texture as it ages and absorbs moisture. Under magnification, individual particles of SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ appear as
            irregular, angular grains. Organic particulates contribute to a slightly sticky feel, especially in humid environments.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of
            1-2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to liquid
            condensation and flow), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation), discrete
            patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles), and stains (from dissolved contaminants).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, electrostatic charge, surface roughness, and the
            presence of localized contamination sources.
        iridium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (shifting towards darker browns and blacks), and
            more difficult to remove due to chemical bonding and compaction. The thickness also increases significantly over
            time.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles adhering to the surface (hours).
            It then thickens as more particles accumulate, especially at contact points and edges (days). Over time, the dust
            spreads inward from the edges, forming a more continuous layer (weeks). Layering effects can occur due to seasonal
            variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months). The dust consolidates and becomes more difficult
            to remove as it ages.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5DC). Slightly aged: Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of yellow-brown. Moderately aged: Reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide content. Heavily aged: Dark brown
            (#8B4513) with possible black soot deposits (#000000). Pollen-rich: Yellowish-green tint (#9ACD32).'
          common_patterns: The dust distributes unevenly. It accumulates first in crevices, corners, and along edges due to
            electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks from water runoff.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices compared to the center of
            flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal components tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners
            and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom
            (heavier) due to gravity and water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and a very thin, barely visible film (1-2 μm). Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy film with some visible color variation (2-5 μm). Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous layer with
            noticeable color and texture (5-20 μm). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, almost opaque layer with significant texture
            and color variation (20-50 μm). Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer completely obscuring the underlying
            Iridium surface (50-200+ μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on Iridium typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light gray to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends
            to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation,
            point source spreading (e.g., around a vent), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, and localized
            concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. While the center of flat surfaces
            also accumulates dust, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges. This creates a visible outline
            effect.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow
            patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas,
            especially horizontal surfaces. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges, creating a
            visible outline. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer.
            Runs down slopes are common. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces, forming small stalactite-like structures in
            extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow effect unless
            oil or other contaminants are present within the dust layer.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly crusty or granular
            as it ages and absorbs moisture. It feels gritty to the touch. At close range (10x magnification), individual
            particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments,
            and irregular soot aggregates.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water,
            thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas where moisture accumulates, discrete patches where
            dust adheres preferentially, spots/dots from individual particles, and stains caused by chemical reactions between
            the dust and the Iridium surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of crevices or other surface features. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical or angled surfaces.
        iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a light, powdery coating that is easily removed.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes more consolidated and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color
            darkens over time due to the incorporation of organic matter and the oxidation of iron particles within the dust
            layer. Thickness increases gradually, and the texture can become more crusty.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film of dust that gradually thickens over time. Accumulation often
            begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on
            horizontal surfaces. Point sources of contamination expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects
            can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Timeframes: Visible film within
            hours, noticeable coating within days, significant buildup within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #C8C6C4 (light gray with a slight brownish tint). Aged dust (dry): #736968 (medium
            grayish-brown). Aged dust (damp): #544B47 (darker, almost blackish-brown). Dust mixed with rust: #8C472A (reddish-brown,
            approaching sienna). Soot-heavy dust: #363432 (very dark gray, almost black).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from wind and rain.
            On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer of dust. Point sources of contamination (e.g., nearby construction) can create radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and depressions act as collection
            points for dust. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal members accumulate
            more dust than the undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible speckling of dust, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy coating, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating that partially obscures the underlying
            surface, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating that significantly obscures the underlying surface,
            thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with a thick, obscuring layer, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on iron typically appears as a matte, brownish-gray coating that obscures the underlying
            metallic sheen. The texture ranges from fine and powdery to slightly crusty depending on humidity and the presence
            of binding agents. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a complete, obscuring layer, often accumulating in
            crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation along
            corners and seams, point source spreading from localized contamination sources, gradient from source with decreasing
            concentration further away, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven deposition, streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces due to water runoff, localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced airflow
            and the trapping of particles. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of
            dust. This is due to the edges acting as barriers, disrupting airflow and causing particles to deposit more readily.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and the trapping of particles.
            Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces are subject to drip marks and streaking.
            Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along their length. Depressions and indentations act as collection
            points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs of dust particles.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off due to gravity and vibration.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and slightly lighter in color. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to emphasize the gray tones. There is no significant sheen or gloss unless the dust layer is mixed
            with oil or other contaminants. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty when dry. Can become sticky or crusty when exposed to moisture
            or oils. At a microscopic level (100x magnification), individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible,
            including angular mineral fragments, spherical pollen grains, and irregular soot aggregates. The surface is generally
            matte, lacking any significant gloss.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (barely visible film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas
            or crevices, thickness can exceed 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by rainwater, pools/puddles in depressions, discrete patches
            where dust has settled unevenly, stains caused by the leaching of contaminants from the dust layer, uniform coatings
            on horizontal surfaces, buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface orientation, exposure to wind and rain, and the presence
            of surface irregularities. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        kevlar-reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, powdery coating, easily disturbed. Aged
            contamination (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and may exhibit staining of the underlying polymer.
            The color shifts towards darker browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds and the incorporation of more
            organic matter.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Months of exposure lead to significant thickening and compaction of the dust layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (Tan), Aged dust: #A07A55 (Sienna), Iron-rich dust: #B7410E (Rust), Soot-heavy
            dust: #4A4A4A (Dark Gray), Pollen-rich dust: #E4D00A (Golden Yellow, seasonal).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially along edges, in crevices, and around any raised features on the
            Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces
            tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices, lighter on flat, exposed
            surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit
            the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier accumulation at the
            bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating,
            5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscuring some of the underlying material, 20-50 μm thick.
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring most of the underlying material, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick,
            crusty layer, significantly altering the appearance, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on Kevlar-reinforced polymer typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer
            with a dominant color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the local soil composition. The dust
            tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns), point source spreading (from localized contamination sources),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is because edges act
            as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by wind or air currents.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs and
            streaks. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly crusty and compacted
            with age and moisture exposure. It feels gritty to the touch. At close range, individual particles are visible,
            especially with magnification, showing a mix of angular and rounded shapes.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 100-500 μm
            or more in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete
            patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains (from prolonged
            contact with moisture), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, electrostatic charge, wind
            exposure, and the presence of crevices or other features that trap dust.
        lanthanum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color deepens and may become mottled
            due to chemical reactions with the Lanthanum surface and atmospheric components. Thickness increases over time,
            potentially forming a crusty layer in areas of heavy accumulation.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges. Over time (days/weeks),
            the film thickens and spreads, gradually covering more of the surface. Point sources expand outward, creating
            localized patches. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            After months, the dust can compact and form a more cohesive layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to pale tan (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown
            (#A0522D, Sienna) due to iron oxide, to dark gray (#696969) from soot, and yellowish-brown (#B8860B, DarkGoldenrod)
            if pollen is prevalent. Heavily contaminated areas can exhibit a muted orange-brown (#8B4513, SaddleBrown).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in sheltered areas, such as crevices, corners, and horizontal surfaces.
            On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common, especially after rain or condensation. Edges and raised
            features often exhibit a higher concentration of dust due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to airflow and electrostatic
            effects. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces exposed to the open
            air are generally more contaminated than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a light dusting, barely visible to the naked eye, thickness
            < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer, easily disturbed, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable
            layer, obscuring the original surface color, thickness 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, continuous layer, significantly
            altering the surface appearance, thickness 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring
            the original surface, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Lanthanum typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a muted, earthy
            tone. The color is generally a blend of browns, grays, and reddish-browns, depending on the local soil composition
            and industrial pollutants. Coverage varies from sparse to complete, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The center areas may have a lower concentration, especially on flat surfaces. This edge effect is
            more pronounced in areas with significant airflow.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect more dust than angled surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as collection points, leading to increased dust buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to higher
            concentrations compared to vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in depressions.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Damp dust may appear slightly darker and more reflective
            than dry dust. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry, becoming slightly sticky or muddy when
            damp. It feels gritty to the touch, especially with higher concentrations of silica. Under magnification (100x),
            individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral fragments and rounded
            organic particles.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm or more in areas of significant accumulation. In extreme cases, crusts exceeding 1 mm can form.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation), discrete patches (due
            to localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual particles settling), stains (from chemical reactions),
            buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity is influenced by airflow patterns, surface roughness, electrostatic
            charge, and the presence of localized dust sources.
        lead:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed powder. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and binding of particles), and
            more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and layering may become apparent, especially in sheltered
            areas.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more often, point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur over longer periods (months/years), especially
            with seasonal variations in dust composition and humidity.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light Grayish Tan (#D3D3D3 with a slight yellow tint). Aged (weeks): Dusty Rose (#BC8F8F).
            Aged (months/years): Reddish Brown (#A0522D) with darker brown (#4E342E) in crevices. Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray
            (#A9A9A9) to Black (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Green (#9ACD32, seasonal).'
          common_patterns: 'Accumulation is often non-uniform. Common patterns include: edge accumulation due to electrostatic
            effects and airflow patterns; localized spots from point sources (e.g., drips from above); and a general settling
            on horizontal surfaces. Crevices and surface imperfections act as traps for dust particles.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces due to gravitational settling. Corners
            and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show streaking due to water runoff, leading
            to variable concentrations along the streak's path. Flat horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than inclined
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            but thin layer, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Clearly visible layer, obscuring the original surface color,
            25-75 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring most of the original surface, 75-200 μm thick. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, potentially crusty layer, completely obscuring the original surface, >200 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on lead typically presents as a matte, grayish-brown to reddish-brown layer. The
            texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly crusty deposit depending on humidity and age. Coverage varies from
            sparse speckling to a complete coating, often thicker in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments);
            edge accumulation (very common); point source spreading (common near vents or openings); gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance); patchy/spotty (common due to uneven airflow); streaky/linear (common
            on vertical surfaces due to water runoff); localized concentrations (in crevices); and radial patterns (around
            point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points, attracting dust particles from the surrounding air. The center areas
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating, but the edges consistently show higher concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices, acting as traps. It builds up in crevices due to reduced
            airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas allow for settling and accumulation. Vertical surfaces experience
            dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns. Depressions
            fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven water runoff. Horizontal
            surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs, and overhead surfaces may have dust hanging
            precariously.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant in color, with subtle variations in
            shade becoming more apparent. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust look
            more uniformly gray or brown. The surface is generally matte, so there is minimal specular reflection. Wet dust
            will appear darker and may exhibit a slight sheen.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is a fine, loose powder, feeling slightly gritty. Over time, moisture can cause
            it to become slightly sticky or crusty, especially if organic matter is present. Close inspection may reveal individual
            particles of varying sizes and shapes, including angular mineral fragments and rounded pollen grains. The surface
            is generally matte, with no significant gloss unless wetted.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) in areas with minimal accumulation to a heavy buildup
            (100-500 μm, or even 1-2 mm in extreme cases) in sheltered areas or crevices. The average thickness on exposed
            surfaces is usually between 25-100 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on exposed surfaces); thick crusts (in sheltered areas
            with high humidity); discrete patches (due to localized sources); spots/dots (initial deposition points); stains
            (from water runoff); uniform coatings (rare); buildups (in corners and crevices); drip marks (on vertical surfaces);
            and runs/streaks (due to water or wind).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Variations are caused by uneven airflow, electrostatic effects, surface imperfections, and the location
            of dust sources. Sheltered areas tend to accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        lead crystal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination becomes more
            consolidated and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker shades of brown and gray. Thickness
            increases, and the dust may become partially cemented by atmospheric moisture and dissolved minerals.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, uniformly covering exposed surfaces. Over time, dust
            accumulates at edges and in crevices. On vertical surfaces, drip marks and streaks develop. The dust layer thickens
            gradually, with seasonal variations in accumulation rates (higher during dry, windy periods). Layering effects
            may occur due to alternating periods of dust deposition and cleaning attempts. Timeframe: Visible film within
            hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant accumulation within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C) with
            localized areas of reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray (#A9A9A9) to almost black
            (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32) in localized patches.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform but thinner layer. Drip marks and streaks are often observed
            on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and in crevices compared to the center of flat
            surfaces. Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces in sheltered environments. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier concentrations at the bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Light (10-30%): A thin film, slightly
            dulling the crystal''s surface. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable graying or tan discoloration, obscuring some details.
            Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, obscuring most details, thickness around 100-200 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the crystal''s surface, thickness exceeding 200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on lead crystal typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant grayish-tan
            hue. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating subtle shading variations across the crystal's
            surface. Over time, moisture can cause the dust to consolidate, leading to more noticeable streaks and spotting.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (from localized contamination sources), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff), and localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer. This is because
            edges act as barriers, trapping airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces promote drip marks and streaks. Edges act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs down the incline.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and slightly dull, reducing the crystal's
            brilliance. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the uneven distribution of the dust, revealing streaks and
            patches. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. As moisture accumulates, it
            can become sticky or slightly crusty. At high magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and
            sizes are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and fibrous organic material.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers (μm) for light dust layers to 50 to 200 μm for
            heavy buildup. In extreme cases, particularly in sheltered areas, thickness can exceed 500 μm (0.5 mm).
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on flat surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to water runoff), discrete patches (from localized sources), spots/dots (from individual particles),
            stains (from dissolved contaminants), and buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered environments may exhibit
            mostly uniform distribution with minor variations. Vertical surfaces and exposed areas are typically highly variable/irregular
            due to wind and water runoff. Crevices and edges show concentrated accumulation.
        limestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination becomes darker,
            more consolidated, and harder to remove. The color shifts from light tan to darker brown or gray. Thickness increases
            over time, and the texture becomes rougher. Biological growth (algae, lichen) may become visible, adding green
            or black patches.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited by wind. Over time, the film
            thickens as more particles accumulate. Deposition often begins at contact points (edges, corners) and then spreads
            inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources (e.g., a chimney)
            create radial patterns of dust deposition. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates. This process can take days to months to years depending on environmental factors.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C8C8A9). Aged dust: Darker brownish-gray (#776E65),
            Rust-tinged areas due to iron oxides (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F), Areas with organic
            growth: greenish-brown (#8F9779).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in sheltered areas, such as crevices, corners, and under overhangs. Vertical
            surfaces often exhibit streaks and drip marks due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a more uniform
            layer. Edges and raised features may show preferential accumulation due to electrostatic effects and wind patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas (crevices,
            corners). Vertical surfaces tend to have lighter concentrations, with streaks and drip marks indicating areas
            of runoff. Edges and raised features often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and wind
            deposition. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film (1-10 μm). Light (10-30%): Lightly dusted
            appearance, limestone color still dominant (10-30 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, partially obscuring
            the limestone color (30-60 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Significant dust buildup, limestone color largely obscured (60-100
            μm). Extreme (>85%): Thick, consolidated dust layer, completely obscuring the limestone surface (>100 μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on limestone presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically ranging from light tan
            to dark brown depending on the composition and age of the deposit. The texture varies from a fine powdery coating
            to a more consolidated, slightly crusty layer, often accumulating in crevices and sheltered areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, Edge accumulation
            along raised features, Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, Patchy/spotty distribution
            in areas with varying exposure, Localized concentrations in crevices and corners, Gradient from source (e.g.,
            a nearby road or industrial facility).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust often preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to electrostatic
            effects, wind patterns, and reduced water runoff. Center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but
            potentially thinner, layer. Avoidance of edges is rare, unless the edge is specifically designed to shed water
            or dust.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water runoff. Flat areas
            tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges and raised features
            collect dust due to electrostatic attraction and wind deposition. Depressions and indentations act as traps for
            dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces
            accumulate settled dust. Runs down slopes are observed after rainfall. Dust can hang from overhead surfaces in
            sheltered areas, forming small stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. The color is more vibrant.
            Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the color appears muted and less saturated. The surface may exhibit slight
            sheen if the dust layer contains oily or waxy components.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is powdery and fine, with particle sizes ranging from 1-50 μm. Over time, moisture
            and chemical reactions can cause it to become more consolidated, forming a slightly rough, granular surface. In
            sheltered areas, a thin crust may develop. The touch feel varies from smooth (fresh) to slightly gritty (aged).
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (sparse) to a heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or more
            in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, crusts can reach thicknesses of 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films on exposed surfaces, Drip marks and runs/streaks on
            vertical surfaces, Pools/puddles of dust in depressions, Thick crusts in sheltered areas, Discrete patches of
            dust in areas with varying exposure, Stains caused by dissolved minerals in rainwater, Buildups in corners and
            crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is influenced by factors such as wind direction, rainfall patterns, surface geometry,
            and proximity to dust sources. Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        magnesium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards brown or black due to
            oxidation and accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, the film thickens and becomes more visible. After weeks, the dust begins to compact and adhere more strongly.
            Months of accumulation lead to a noticeable layer with discoloration and potential crust formation. Seasonal variations
            in dust composition and humidity influence the rate and nature of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D3D3D3 (light gray), Aged dust: #A9A9A9 (dark gray), Dust with iron oxides: #8B4513
            (brown), Dust with organic matter: #696969 (dark gray), Dust with calcium carbonate: #F5F5DC (beige)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity, and accumulation in crevices and corners. Edges often show a higher concentration of dust due to electrostatic
            attraction and wind patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal components
            will have higher concentrations than the bottom. Crevices and gaps act as dust traps.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, thin film, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): slight discoloration,
            powdery texture, 5-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable coating, gray or brownish tint, 25-100 μm thickness.
            Heavy (60-85%): thick layer, obscures original surface, 100-250 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): very thick, crusty
            buildup, significant discoloration, >250 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on magnesium typically appears as a dull, matte coating ranging from light gray
            to brownish-gray. The texture is generally powdery or slightly gritty, and the distribution is often uneven, influenced
            by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (perimeter of panels), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            wind patterns. The perimeter of panels and components often shows a higher concentration of dust compared to the
            center areas. This is especially noticeable on large, flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            collecting dust carried by wind. Depressions and indentations fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a uniform layer. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges and in low-lying areas. Runs down slopes are common after rain or condensation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a slightly brighter, more diffuse reflection. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed
            unless oil or moisture is present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to talcum powder. Depending on humidity
            and organic content, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. At higher magnification (SEM), individual particles
            of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and carbon black are visible, ranging in size from 0.5 μm to 50 μm.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particle deposition), stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            uniform coatings (horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies from mostly uniform with minor variations (on sheltered horizontal surfaces)
            to highly variable/irregular (on exposed vertical surfaces). Uniformity is influenced by wind direction, surface
            orientation, and cleaning frequency.
        mahogany:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination becomes more
            compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays due to chemical
            reactions and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time, potentially forming a visible
            crust.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly. Over days, these
            particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly. Over months,
            the layer thickens and becomes more compacted. Seasonal variations in dust composition and humidity can lead to
            layering effects, with distinct layers of different colors and textures. The process is gradual and continuous,
            with the rate of accumulation depending on environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Drifts towards a muted brown
            (#A68B64) or a slightly reddish-brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide content. Soot presence can introduce dark gray
            (#696969) or black (#000000) areas. Pollen can add a yellowish tint (#FAFAD2).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation along edges and in crevices is common. Horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more
            uniform layer. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks or drip marks due to rain or condensation. Areas sheltered
            from wind and rain may have thicker, more undisturbed deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more dust than flat, exposed areas. Top surfaces exposed to the environment
            will have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and indentations are prime accumulation points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, slight dulling of the mahogany''s natural color.
            Thickness: <10 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable dusting, but the underlying mahogany is still clearly visible. Thickness:
            10-30 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant dust layer, partially obscuring the mahogany''s color and grain. Thickness:
            30-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick dust layer, significantly altering the mahogany''s appearance. Thickness: 100-200
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick dust layer, almost completely obscuring the underlying mahogany. Thickness: >200
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on mahogany presents as a dulling layer, shifting the underlying reddish-brown hue
            towards muted browns and grays. The texture varies from a fine, powdery coating to a slightly gritty or crusty
            surface depending on humidity and dust composition. Coverage is often uneven, accumulating in crevices and along
            edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation along
            raised features, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, localized concentrations in crevices and indentations.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced airflow
            and the barrier effect of edges. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner,
            layer of dust. This is due to the edges acting as traps for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. It
            builds up in crevices, filling depressions and obscuring fine details. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform
            layer. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust particles carried
            by wind.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of airborne dust. Runs down slopes are common, creating
            streaky patterns. Dust hangs from overhead surfaces in minimal amounts due to electrostatic forces, but is generally
            dislodged easily.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses light, reducing the mahogany's
            natural sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and color variations. Soot particles
            may exhibit a slight sheen under certain angles of light. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive when lightly deposited. With increased humidity or organic
            content, it can become sticky or slightly crusty. Close inspection reveals a fine, granular texture with occasional
            larger particles (e.g., pollen grains). The underlying mahogany grain may be partially obscured, but still discernible.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas or crevices,
            buildup can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films on smooth surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water runoff, discrete patches around point sources, spots/dots
            from individual dust particles, stains from organic matter, buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, and the presence of localized
            contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        manganese:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, the dust becomes more
            compacted and adheres more strongly to the manganese surface. Color darkens due to oxidation of iron compounds
            and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually with continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly on the surface (hours).
            Over days, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster
            than flat surfaces. Over months, the dust layer thickens and becomes more compacted. Seasonal variations in dust
            concentration and humidity can lead to layering effects, with alternating layers of different colors and textures.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of rust-orange (#A0522D) where iron oxides are present. Heavily aged dust (months/years): Reddish-brown (#8B4513)
            to dark brown (#654321) with possible black soot deposits (#000000).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. On vertical
            surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common due to rain or condensation. Areas sheltered from wind and rain tend
            to have thicker, more uniform deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and in crevices where dust particles are trapped.
            Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower
            concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and areas near potential dust sources (e.g., vents) exhibit
            the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy layer, color barely noticeable, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Visible layer, distinct color change,
            thickness 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significant color change, thickness 100-300 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, completely obscures the underlying manganese, thickness > 300 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on manganese typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light gray to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content and age of the deposit. The
            dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very sheltered environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            dust density with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface roughness or localized contamination),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and particle
            trapping. The edges act as barriers, causing dust to settle along their perimeter. Center areas tend to have thinner,
            more uniform deposits, unless there is a localized contamination source in the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and particle trapping. Flat areas
            allow for settling and uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            causing dust to accumulate along their length. Depressions and pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled dust. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead
            surfaces may have dust hanging in loose formations, eventually falling due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a slightly dull, chalky appearance. The presence of soot can create darker, less reflective areas. No
            significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch due to
            the presence of silica and alumina particles. At higher magnification (100x), individual particles of varying
            shapes and sizes are visible. In humid conditions, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal disturbance, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high humidity and dust concentration),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (initial deposition points), stains (where dust
            has reacted with the manganese surface), uniform coatings (rare, in very sheltered areas), buildups (in crevices
            and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in surface roughness, airflow patterns, and the presence of localized contamination
            sources. Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than exposed vertical surfaces.
        maple:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time (days to weeks), the
            dust darkens and becomes more visible as more particles accumulate and organic matter decomposes. Aged dust (months/years)
            can become compacted and harder to remove, sometimes forming a thin, cemented crust. Color shifts towards darker
            browns and grays.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film
            thickens and becomes more visible, particularly at contact points and edges. After weeks, dust begins to accumulate
            in crevices and depressions. Months of exposure lead to a thicker, more compacted layer that can be difficult
            to remove. Seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen in spring) can create layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0C0C0). Aged dust (weeks): Light brown with a hint
            of reddish-orange (#A68B64). Heavily soiled/aged: Dark brownish-gray, approaching black in crevices (#4A4A4A).
            Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA). Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray to black (#363636).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, accumulating more heavily in recessed areas, along edges,
            and in the grain of the maple. Streaks and drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend
            to accumulate a more even layer. Areas sheltered from wind and rain will have heavier deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat, exposed areas. Crevices and depressions act as traps, leading
            to significantly higher concentrations. Top surfaces of horizontal elements accumulate more dust than undersides.
            Sheltered areas accumulate more than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film, slightly dulling the maple''s surface, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Visible layer, obscuring some
            of the wood grain, thickness 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significantly altering the maple''s appearance,
            thickness 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup, completely obscuring the maple''s surface, thickness
            >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on maple typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to brownish-gray. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating visible
            patterns that highlight the wood's grain and surface imperfections. Coverage varies significantly depending on
            environmental conditions and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces indoors),
            edge accumulation (along edges and corners), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface
            irregularities), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff), localized concentrations
            (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on maple. This is due
            to a combination of factors including airflow patterns, electrostatic attraction, and the tendency of edges to
            act as barriers to dust movement. Center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices act
            as traps, preventing dust from being easily removed. Flat areas allow for even settling. Vertical surfaces experience
            drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Depressions fill with
            dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges where dust accumulates and is held
            by surface tension. Runs down slopes are common, creating visible trails. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust,
            but it is more prone to falling off due to gravity and vibration.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The dust does not typically exhibit iridescence or rainbow
            effects unless oil or moisture is present. The color appears slightly lighter under bright light and darker under
            dim light.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become slightly crusty, especially if exposed to moisture and subsequent drying.
            Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of fine particles. It is not typically sticky unless mixed with
            moisture or oils.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. Extreme cases can reach up to 1 mm in crevices or areas with
            prolonged exposure and minimal cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial layer), thick crusts (aged, compacted dust),
            discrete patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual particles or small clumps), stains (where moisture
            has dissolved and redeposited dust components), uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), buildups
            (in corners and crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of crevices or
            other surface features. Horizontal indoor surfaces are the most likely to have relatively uniform distribution.
        marble:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more deeply embedded in the marble's surface, harder to remove, and often darker in
            color due to chemical reactions and the incorporation of moisture and organic matter. Thickness increases over
            time, and the texture can become more consolidated.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, typically within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns.
            Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Significant buildup
            can occur within months, with noticeable changes in color and texture.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a slight yellowish tint. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            brownish-gray (#848482) to a darker, sooty gray (#4A4A4A). Areas with iron oxide may exhibit a rust-orange hue
            (#A0522D). Pollen can add a yellowish-green tint (#9ACD32) in localized areas.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from wind and rain.
            Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks and drip marks, while horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform
            layer. Areas near pollution sources may show localized dark spots.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices where dust particles are
            trapped. Top surfaces exposed to rainfall may have lighter concentrations compared to sheltered undersides. Corners
            and areas near pollution sources exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient with higher
            concentration at the bottom due to gravity and runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            graying of the surface, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct discoloration, obscuring some of the marble''s
            veining, thickness 25-75 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant darkening, obscuring most of the marble''s veining, thickness
            75-150 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the marble''s surface, thickness >150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on marble presents as a fine, often uneven layer that dulls the surface and obscures
            the underlying stone's veining. The color is typically a muted grayish-brown, with variations depending on the
            local environment and dust composition. Accumulation is often heavier in recessed areas and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along raised features, point source spreading from vents or pipes, gradient from source decreasing with distance,
            patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rain or
            condensation, and localized concentrations in crevices and pores.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns
            and reduced cleaning effectiveness in these areas. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried
            by the wind. Center areas tend to be more exposed to cleaning and weathering, resulting in lower dust accumulation.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and reduced exposure to cleaning. It builds
            up in crevices and pores, providing sheltered locations. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Drips
            form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions fill with
            dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles. Runs down slopes are observed, and dust can hang from overhead surfaces
            in sheltered locations. The settling velocity of dust particles is typically in the range of 0.01-0.1 m/s, influencing
            the settling rate on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced and can exhibit a matte finish.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust less noticeable. No significant sheen
            or iridescence is typically observed unless oily contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become slightly crusty, especially if exposed to moisture and subsequent drying.
            Under magnification (10x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            prolonged accumulation, thickness can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water flow,
            thin films on exposed areas, thick crusts in sheltered areas with moisture, discrete patches where dust adheres
            to surface imperfections, stains from organic matter, and buildups in corners and crevices. Crystalline structures
            are not typically observed unless specific salts are present in the dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in airflow, surface texture, and exposure to environmental factors. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        mdf:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted, darker in color due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron),
            and more difficult to remove. The thickness also increases over time, and the texture can become more crusty or
            cemented.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and in crevices. Over time,
            the film thickens and spreads, eventually covering more of the surface. Point sources, such as ventilation outlets,
            create expanding radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            concentration. The process can take days to months to reach significant levels.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90), Aged dust: Dark grayish-brown (#635B53), Dust with
            high iron content: Reddish-brown (#8B4513), Dust with high carbon content: Dark gray (#4A4A4A), Dust with pollen:
            Yellowish-gray (#C8C6B6).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer than vertical surfaces, where gravity causes
            streaking. Crevices and imperfections in the MDF surface act as traps for dust particles.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust
            than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal elements accumulate more dust than the bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks of dust, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy layer, MDF surface still clearly visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer,
            partially obscuring the MDF surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly obscuring
            the MDF surface. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick layer, completely obscuring the MDF surface.
            Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on MDF typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant grayish-brown
            hue. The distribution is often uneven, accumulating more heavily in crevices and along edges. Over time, the dust
            can become more compacted and darker in color.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in low-traffic
            areas), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around ventilation outlets),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners). Edge
            accumulation and uniform coating are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have
            a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation and electrostatic attraction. It builds
            up in crevices and imperfections on the MDF surface. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks due to gravity. Edges act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. The settling rate depends on particle
            size and air currents.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The color appears slightly warmer under incandescent lighting
            compared to cooler fluorescent lighting. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine to the touch. With increased humidity or compaction,
            it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a granular texture, with individual particles
            visible under magnification (10x or greater). The MDF surface texture influences the dust's apparent texture.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 micrometers (thin film) to 500 micrometers (heavy buildup). In
            extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            with high humidity and dust concentration), discrete patches (on uneven surfaces), spots/dots (due to individual
            dust particles adhering to the surface), stains (if the dust contains staining agents), uniform coatings (on horizontal
            surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare.
            The uniformity level is influenced by airflow patterns, surface texture, electrostatic charge, and the source
            of the dust.
        metal matrix composites mmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic matter decomposition),
            and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the dust may become slightly cemented or hardened.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, this film thickens and becomes more consolidated. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly than flat
            surfaces. Over months, the dust layer becomes darker and more difficult to remove, potentially forming a crusty
            layer. Seasonal variations in dust levels can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E0CBA8 (light beige-tan). Aged dust (moderate iron content): #A07A55 (sienna brown).
            Aged dust (high iron content): #8B4513 (chocolate brown). Dust with significant carbon soot: #4A4A4A (dark grey).
            Dust with calcium carbonate: #F5F5DC (beige).'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with localized spots and streaks caused by rain
            or wind. Accumulation is most pronounced in crevices, around fasteners, and along edges. Flat horizontal surfaces
            tend to collect a thicker, more even layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical walls. Edges
            and corners accumulate more dust than flat center areas. Crevices and sheltered areas have the highest concentrations.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, individual particles scattered across the surface.
            Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, easily disturbed layer. Thickness: 5-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable
            layer that obscures the underlying surface texture. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, consolidated
            layer that significantly alters the surface appearance. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty
            layer that completely obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) typically presents as a fine, matte layer with
            a color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the local soil composition and exposure. The dust
            tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a visually textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very low dust environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            dust concentration with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (due to rain or condensation), streaky/linear (due
            to wind or water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and around fasteners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. The center areas of flat surfaces
            tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry strongly influences dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces
            experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common result of rainwater washing dust downwards. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a slightly duller, more subdued color. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
            The color saturation is generally low.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry, becoming slightly sticky or muddy when
            wet. At a microscopic level, individual particles are angular and irregular. It feels gritty to the touch, especially
            with heavier accumulations. No crystalline structure is typically visible without magnification.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 100-500
            μm or more in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete
            patches (where water droplets evaporate), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains (from dissolved
            minerals), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, surface geometry, and the presence of obstacles
            that trap dust.
        molybdenum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and may exhibit color changes due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation
            of iron). The aged layer can become more difficult to remove and may form a thin, hardened crust.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Significant buildup (visible to the naked eye) typically occurs within days to weeks.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle variations depending on local soil composition.
            Aged dust (weeks): Light reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to oxidation of iron. Dust with high soot content: Dark grayish-brown
            (#4F4F4F). Dust with calcareous content: Off-white to light beige (#F5F5DC). Dust with pollen: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in sheltered areas, such as crevices, corners, and undersides.
            On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common due to gravity. Flat, horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer of dust. Edges often show a slightly higher concentration due to electrostatic attraction
            and air currents.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Crevices
            and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations
            than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy layer,
            5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, partially obscuring the surface, 20-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, obscuring layer, 100-300 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, heavily obscuring layer, 300-500+ μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on molybdenum typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often showing streaks or localized concentrations, especially in crevices or along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            due to electrostatic effects, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow,
            and streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and air currents. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer. This is especially noticeable on
            flat, exposed surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act
            as collection points. Depressions and indentations fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust. Slopes exhibit runs down the
            incline. Overhead surfaces may accumulate hanging dust, but this is less common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant, with reddish-brown hues becoming more
            pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the dust appears duller and more grayish. The surface is generally
            matte, with no significant sheen or gloss. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x),
            individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible. Depending on humidity, the dust can become slightly
            sticky or form a thin crust. The surface is matte, not glossy.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 50-500 μm in heavily contaminated areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, drip
            marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks due to water runoff, discrete patches from localized contamination, spots/dots
            from individual particles, and stains from dissolved contaminants. No crystalline structures are expected.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, electrostatic charge, and
            the location of contamination sources.
        mortar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination becomes more
            deeply embedded in the mortar surface, exhibiting a darker, more consolidated appearance. The color shifts towards
            brown or reddish-brown due to oxidation of iron compounds. The texture becomes harder and more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges. Over time,
            the film thickens and spreads, eventually covering larger areas. Accumulation can be gradual and uniform, or it
            can occur in distinct layers due to seasonal variations in dust deposition. Point sources of pollution can create
            localized areas of heavy buildup that expand outward. Timeframes: Initial film forms within hours/days. Noticeable
            buildup occurs within weeks/months. Significant crusting can take years.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a slight yellowish tint (#F0E68C) due to pollen. Aged dust:
            Ranges from a muted brownish-gray (#848482) to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide accumulation. Areas
            with organic matter may exhibit a darker, almost blackish-brown (#362F2E). Soot presence can shift the color towards
            a cool, dark gray (#4A4A4A).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along mortar joints, and at the base of vertical surfaces
            due to gravity and airflow patterns. Flat, horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Streaks
            and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces, especially after rainfall.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and indentations act as traps
            for dust particles. Top surfaces of horizontal elements exposed to rain may be cleaner than sheltered undersides.
            Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity and water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer, easily removed. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, with
            some color change to the mortar. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, consolidated layer, significantly
            altering the appearance of the mortar. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, almost
            completely obscuring the original mortar surface. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on mortar presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically exhibiting a range of earthy
            tones. The texture varies from fine powder to a slightly crusty surface, depending on humidity and age. Coverage
            is often uneven, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along mortar joints, point source spreading from nearby pollution sources, gradient from source with decreasing
            concentration further away, patchy/spotty distribution due to wind and rain patterns, streaky/linear patterns
            on vertical surfaces due to water runoff, and localized concentrations in sheltered areas.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns
            and sheltering effects. The center of flat surfaces tends to have a thinner, more uniform layer. The perimeter
            of an area often shows higher concentration than the inner area.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and sheltering from rain. Flat
            areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and indentations fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a thicker layer of dust due to settling. Runs down slopes
            are common after rainfall. Dust tends to hang from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish, with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and variations in color. The presence of soot can create
            a slightly darker, less reflective surface. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust layer is powdery and fine, easily disturbed by touch. Over time, especially
            in humid environments, it can become slightly sticky or crusty due to the binding action of moisture and soluble
            salts. Close inspection reveals a granular texture, with individual dust particles ranging from 1 to 50 μm in
            diameter. The surface can feel slightly abrasive.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm in areas with significant accumulation, such as crevices and sheltered surfaces. In extreme cases,
            crusts can reach up to 1 mm thick.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water runoff,
            thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete patches where dust has settled, stains
            caused by organic matter, uniform coatings on horizontal surfaces, and buildups in crevices and corners. No crystalline
            structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by wind direction, rain exposure, surface orientation, and proximity
            to pollution sources. Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        neodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, light-colored film, often barely visible.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated. The color shifts towards darker
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. The texture becomes more crusty and less easily removed.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles within hours. Over days, the film thickens
            and becomes more uniform. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces. Over weeks and months,
            the dust consolidates and forms a crusty layer. Seasonal variations in humidity and dust concentration can lead
            to layering effects, with alternating layers of different colors and compositions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E0D8B4 (light beige-tan). Aged dust (weeks): #A68B64 (medium tan-brown). Dust with
            high iron content: #B7410E (rust-orange). Dust with soot: #4A4A4A (dark grey-brown). Dust with calcium carbonate:
            #F2F2F2 (chalky white, often mixed with other colors).'
          common_patterns: 'Accumulation is often non-uniform. Common patterns include: edge accumulation, settling on horizontal
            surfaces, streaking on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation, and localized concentrations around crevices
            or imperfections in the Neodymium surface.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Vertical
            walls typically have lighter concentrations with streaking due to gravity and rain. Crevices and imperfections
            act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin film, slight discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            layer, color change evident, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significant color change, thickness
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup, obscuring the original surface, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Neodymium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to
            variations in thickness and concentration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (due to rain or condensation),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Center areas tend to have lower concentrations,
            especially on flat surfaces. This behavior is consistent across various Neodymium geometries.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than vertical surfaces. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate
            along them. Depressions and imperfections act as collection points. The dust layer tends to follow the contours
            of the Neodymium surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs of dust particles.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but less than horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow effect unless
            oil films are present within the dust layer, which is possible in industrial environments.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch. At
            higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and Fe₂O₃ can be observed. Organic particulates
            contribute to a slightly sticky or oily feel, especially in humid environments.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1-10 μm for light dusting to 50-200 μm for heavy buildup. In extreme
            cases, particularly in sheltered areas, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform
            coatings (rare), buildups (in sheltered areas), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and runs/streaks (due to liquid
            flow).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare outside of controlled laboratory settings. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in
            airflow, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and the presence of localized sources of contamination.
        nickel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination becomes more
            consolidated, adhering more strongly to the nickel surface. Color darkens over time due to oxidation of iron compounds
            and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually with continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and contact points. Over time, the
            film thickens and spreads inward. Point sources expand outward, creating localized patches of higher concentration.
            Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. The timeframe
            for significant buildup can range from days to months, depending on environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) with subtle gray undertones. Aged dust (days): Tan (#D2B48C)
            with hints of yellow. Aged dust (weeks): Light reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide content. Heavily soiled/aged:
            Dark brown (#8B4513) with possible black soot deposits (#000000). Color varies significantly based on local dust
            composition.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Horizontal surfaces collect more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling. Streaks
            and drip marks may be visible on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Top surfaces exposed to the open air generally have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and
            areas near potential dust sources (e.g., vents) also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls tend to have
            lighter concentrations, except where streaking occurs.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, slightly alters the nickel''s appearance, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures
            the nickel''s original luster, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily disturbed layer, significantly
            alters the nickel''s appearance, thickness 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, compacted layer, almost completely
            obscures the nickel surface, thickness >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on nickel typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, leading to accumulations in crevices and along edges. Over time, the dust can become more compacted
            and darker in color.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments).
            2) Edge accumulation (very common). 3) Point source spreading (around vents or openings). 4) Gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities).
            6) Streaky/linear (due to rain or condensation runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Center areas may have
            lower concentrations due to less airflow and electrostatic charge. Uniform distribution is rare.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than angled surfaces due to gravitational settling. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Depressions and scratches provide locations for dust to accumulate
            and become embedded.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on
            vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust more readily than vertical surfaces. Runs down slopes are
            common, creating streaks and uneven distribution patterns. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a layer
            that thickens over time.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant, with reddish-brown hues becoming more
            pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the dust may appear duller and grayer. The surface is generally
            matte, with minimal specular reflection. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and loose to the touch. Over time, moisture and compaction can
            create a slightly crusty or gritty texture. Close inspection may reveal fine particulate matter, including angular
            mineral grains and rounded pollen particles. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (early stages). 2) Thick crusts (aged, compacted
            dust). 3) Discrete patches (localized contamination). 4) Spots/dots (individual dust particles). 5) Stains (discoloration
            caused by dust interacting with the nickel surface). 6) Drip marks (vertical streaks from water runoff). 7) Buildups
            (accumulations in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare outside of laboratory conditions. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, surface
            roughness, electrostatic charge, and gravitational settling.
        niobium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens and becomes
            more uniform as organic matter decomposes and iron oxides form. Thickness increases over time, especially in sheltered
            areas.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited on the surface (hours). Over
            days, the film thickens and becomes more uniform. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly. Over months,
            the dust layer compacts and adheres more strongly to the surface. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow (#F0E68C). Aged dust: Shifts towards
            a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to almost black (#000000).
            Pollen-rich areas: Can exhibit a slight yellowish-green tint (#9ACD32). Areas with high CaCO₃ content: Off-white
            (#F5F5DC).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in recessed areas, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity. Areas sheltered from wind and rain accumulate
            more dust than exposed areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and recessed areas trap dust,
            leading to higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment tend to have more dust than sheltered
            bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            layer, surface color still dominant, thickness <5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer, surface color
            partially obscured, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick dust layer, surface color largely obscured, thickness
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick dust layer, surface color completely obscured, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Niobium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a range of earthy tones.
            The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often highlighting surface imperfections and edges. Color varies based
            on the composition and age of the dust.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (dust collects along edges and corners),
            point source spreading (dust radiates outward from a specific source), gradient from source (dust concentration
            decreases with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution with distinct patches of dust), streaky/linear
            (dust forms streaks due to wind or water runoff), and localized concentrations (dust accumulates in specific areas
            due to surface irregularities).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and surface
            tension effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. The center areas may
            have less dust due to wind scouring or cleaning efforts.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas allow for more uniform dust deposition. Vertical surfaces promote drip marks and streaking. Edges act as
            barriers, causing dust to accumulate along their length. Depressions and pits trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off due to gravity and vibration.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the uneven distribution. No significant iridescence or
            rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it easily disperses.
            With moisture, it can become slightly sticky or form a thin crust. Under magnification (100x), individual particles
            of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral fragments and rounded organic particles.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in exposed areas to a heavier buildup of 25-100
            μm in sheltered areas and crevices. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 500 μm in areas with prolonged exposure
            and minimal cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical streaks caused by water runoff), runs/streaks
            (linear patterns caused by wind or water), thin films (uniform layer of dust), thick crusts (compacted dust layers
            in sheltered areas), discrete patches (isolated areas of dust accumulation), spots/dots (small, localized dust
            particles), and stains (discoloration caused by dust reacting with the Niobium surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, and the location of dust sources. Flat, horizontal surfaces
            tend to have more uniform coverage than complex geometries.
        nitinol:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, easily disturbed layer with a lighter color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and binding of
            particles), and more difficult to remove. The thickness increases over time, and the dust may become partially
            embedded in the Nitinol surface due to surface reactions.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but point sources expanding outward are more common in industrial settings. Layering effects can occur due to
            intermittent cleaning or changes in dust composition (seasonal variations).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) with subtle grey undertones. Aged dust (low Fe content): Pale
            tan (#E9C46A). Aged dust (moderate Fe content): Burnt Sienna (#E9724C). Aged dust (high Fe content): Reddish-brown
            (#A0522D). Soot-rich dust: Dark grey (#4A4A4A) mixed with other colors.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include edge accumulation, localized spots around potential contamination sources
            (e.g., nearby machinery), and a general settling of dust on horizontal surfaces. Streaking can occur on vertical
            surfaces due to condensation or cleaning attempts.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns. Crevices
            and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to settling dust are heavier than
            undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin film, 1-2 μm thick. Light (10-30%): A faint
            dusting, slightly altering the Nitinol''s original color, 2-10 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer,
            obscuring the original surface in some areas, 10-30 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily visible layer, significantly
            altering the surface appearance, 30-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring
            the original surface, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on Nitinol typically presents as a matte, slightly granular coating, ranging in
            color from light tan to reddish-brown depending on the iron oxide content. The dust layer tends to accumulate
            more heavily in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (common near machinery), gradient from source (common),
            patchy/spotty (common), streaky/linear (common on vertical surfaces), localized concentrations (common in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles, leading to a higher concentration
            of dust compared to the center areas. This is a very common observation.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for settling of dust particles. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges
            act as collection points for airborne particles. Depressions and scratches trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a thicker layer over time. Pooling occurs at bottom edges
            and in low-lying areas. Runs down slopes are common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations within the dust layer. No iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oil-based contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At higher magnification (SEM),
            individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible, often agglomerated into larger clusters. The surface
            feels rougher with increased dust layer thickness. Can become slightly sticky if organic particulates are present
            and exposed to humidity.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm in heavily contaminated areas or crevices. Extreme cases can reach up to 500 μm in sheltered areas
            over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages), thick crusts (aged, heavily contaminated),
            discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles or small clusters), stains (if moisture
            is present), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by air currents, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence of surface imperfections.
            Areas with higher surface energy (e.g., scratches) tend to attract more dust.
        nylon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more deeply embedded, darker in color (more reddish-brown), and more difficult to remove.
            The dust layer thickens over time, potentially forming a hardened crust in areas with high accumulation.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads outward. Edges experience faster buildup than center areas. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating localized patches. Layering effects are observed
            with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Months of exposure lead to thicker, more embedded
            layers.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C) with hints of gray. Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to
            iron oxidation. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray (#4A4A4A). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA). Heavily contaminated
            areas: Burnt Sienna (#E97451).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, albeit thinner, coating. Streaks and drip marks are visible
            on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices compared to the center of
            flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to settling dust tend to have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides.
            Corners and areas with rough textures also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical surfaces show a gradient from
            top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            easily removable layer, 10-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, slightly obscures the underlying
            surface, 25-100 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly obscures the underlying surface, 100-250
            μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, almost completely obscures the underlying surface, 250-500
            μm+ thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on nylon typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate in
            crevices and along edges, creating visible patterns and gradients.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on flat surfaces, edge accumulation
            due to electrostatic effects, point source spreading from localized contamination sources, gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, and streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but thinner, coating. This
            edge accumulation is a dominant characteristic.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as
            collection points, leading to higher concentrations. Depressions and textured surfaces trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust, resulting in a more
            uniform coating. Slopes exhibit runs of dust particles. Overhead surfaces may accumulate hanging dust formations,
            though less common on nylon due to its typically smooth surface.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the granular texture. Soot particles may exhibit a slight sheen. No iridescence is typically
            observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At a microscopic level, individual
            particles are visible, creating a granular surface. Depending on humidity, the dust can become slightly sticky
            or form a thin crust.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            in crevices can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water runoff,
            thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in areas with high accumulation and humidity, discrete patches caused
            by localized contamination, spots/dots from individual dust particles, and stains that penetrate the nylon surface
            over time.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Flat surfaces tend to have mostly uniform distribution with
            minor variations. Edges and crevices are highly variable/irregular due to preferential accumulation. Overall,
            the distribution is moderately patchy.
        oak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to organic matter decomposition and oxidation of
            iron), and more difficult to remove. The thickness increases, and the texture becomes more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward,
            or occur as a uniform gradual accumulation across the surface. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering
            effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3). Aged dust (weeks): Yellowish-brown (#A0785A). Dust with
            high iron content: Rust-orange (#B7410E). Dust with soot: Dark grayish-brown (#4A4A4A). Dust with pollen: Pale
            yellow (#FAFAD2).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity. Areas sheltered from wind and rain tend to have thicker
            deposits. Flat surfaces show a more uniform coating, while complex geometries create localized concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical ones. Edges and
            corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and depressions act as traps for
            dust. Top surfaces exposed to the environment accumulate more dust than sheltered undersides. Sheltered areas
            may have higher concentrations of aged dust.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Visible
            film, color change subtle, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable color change, texture slightly altered,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant color change, texture clearly altered, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Thick, obscuring layer, original surface partially hidden, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on oak presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically appearing in shades of tan,
            brown, and gray. The texture varies from fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular feel, depending on humidity
            and composition. Coverage is rarely uniform, with accumulation influenced by surface geometry and airflow.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (along edges of boards or panels),
            point source spreading (radiating from a source like a nail hole), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners). Edge
            accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to a combination of factors: reduced airflow at edges, electrostatic attraction, and the tendency for edges to
            act as barriers, trapping airborne particles. The center of flat surfaces typically has a thinner, more uniform
            layer.'
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, acting as traps. Flat areas allow for pooling of dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drips due to gravity.
            Edges act as barriers, collecting dust. Contours influence airflow, creating localized areas of accumulation or
            removal. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Dust
            can hang from overhead surfaces, forming small accumulations before detaching.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends
            to highlight the variations in color and texture. A slight sheen may be visible on areas with higher organic content
            or where the dust has been compacted. No significant iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine, with particles ranging from 1-50 μm. With increased
            humidity or condensation, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a granular texture,
            especially with higher concentrations of mineral particles. The oak grain itself influences the texture, creating
            micro-ridges where dust accumulates.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm in sheltered areas or crevices. Extreme cases can reach up to 1 mm in very protected locations over
            extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces),
            thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity), discrete patches (due to
            localized sources), spots/dots (due to individual particles settling), stains (where moisture has dissolved dust
            components), uniform coatings (on relatively smooth, horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface roughness, the presence of crevices,
            and the source of the dust. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical ones.
        onyx:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly bound to the surface, often darkening in color due to the accumulation
            of organic matter and the chemical alteration of iron oxides. The texture can also become more consolidated and
            crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film deposited uniformly or at contact points (e.g., edges). Over
            days, the film thickens gradually. Over weeks, dust accumulates in crevices and along edges. Over months, the
            dust layer becomes more consolidated and may darken in color due to organic matter accumulation. Seasonal variations
            in dust deposition rates can lead to layering effects, with distinct layers of different colors and compositions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle variations depending on local soil composition.
            Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D, Sienna) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2723) where
            organic matter and soot are concentrated. Areas with iron oxide may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Pollen
            can add a yellowish tint (#F0E68C) during certain seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Streaking patterns
            are common on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. Areas sheltered from wind and rain often exhibit thicker,
            more uniform dust layers.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices where dust particles are
            trapped. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to direct rainfall
            tend to have lighter dust concentrations compared to sheltered undersides. Corners and areas with rough textures
            also exhibit higher dust concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as scattered specks and a very faint haze. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A thin, barely visible film. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that obscures
            the underlying surface slightly. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that significantly
            alters the appearance of the surface. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely
            obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on onyx typically presents as a matte, slightly granular layer with a dominant color
            range of light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by surface geometry and airflow,
            leading to variations in thickness and concentration across the surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along raised features, point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, and streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. Edge accumulation and uniform coating on horizontal surfaces
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and surface
            tension effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. While the center areas also accumulate dust,
            the concentration is generally lower than at the edges, especially on raised features.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical
            surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. Pooling occurs at bottom edges
            where dust accumulates after being washed down by rain. Runs down slopes are also common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the uneven distribution and variations in color. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch, due to the presence of silica
            and alumina particles. Under magnification (100x), individual dust particles appear as irregular, angular grains.
            In areas with moisture, the dust can become slightly sticky or form a thin, hardened crust.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in areas with minimal accumulation to a heavier
            buildup of 50-200 μm in sheltered areas or crevices. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in particularly
            sheltered locations over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in areas with moisture
            and organic matter, discrete patches where dust has settled unevenly, drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical
            surfaces due to water runoff, and buildups in crevices and along edges. Stains can occur if the dust contains
            soluble components that react with the onyx surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. It is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface roughness, airflow patterns, and exposure to environmental factors. Horizontal surfaces tend to have
            more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        palladium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, light gray film, barely noticeable. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated, often exhibiting a crusty or slightly
            hardened surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays are common due to the accumulation of organic matter
            and oxidation of metallic components.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more commonly, point sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust
            composition and deposition rates. Months of accumulation can lead to a noticeable crust.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5F5). Slightly aged: Pale tan (#E9DAC6). Moderately
            aged: Dusty brown (#A68B64). Heavily soiled: Dark brownish-gray (#696969) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E)
            spots from iron oxide.'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms uneven coatings, with localized spots and streaks. Accumulation is more
            pronounced in sheltered areas and crevices. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are frequently observed
            due to gravity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling.
            Sheltered areas and corners also exhibit higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment often
            have higher concentrations than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin, light gray film (1-2 μm). Light (10-30%):
            A noticeable but thin layer, with some areas of bare palladium visible (2-5 μm). Moderate (30-60%): A more substantial
            layer, partially obscuring the palladium surface (5-20 μm). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer, significantly
            obscuring the palladium surface (20-50 μm). Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring the
            palladium surface (50-200+ μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on palladium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color range
            from light gray to brownish-gray, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate
            unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments).
            2) Edge accumulation (very common due to electrostatic attraction and air currents). 3) Point source spreading
            (around vents or openings). 4) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from a dust source).
            5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition and surface irregularities). 6) Streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity and water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            air currents. The edges act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations compared to the center areas.
            This effect is particularly pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer, while vertical
            surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust
            particles, leading to a more uniform accumulation compared to vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the uneven distribution and variations in color. No significant iridescence
            or rainbow effects are expected unless specific contaminants (e.g., oil films) are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch, similar
            to chalk dust. At higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including
            spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and irregular soot aggregates.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm or more in heavily contaminated areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial deposition). 2) Discrete patches (uneven
            deposition). 3) Spots/dots (individual dust particles or small aggregates). 4) Stains (from dissolved contaminants).
            5) Buildups (in crevices and corners). 6) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 7) Runs/streaks (due to water runoff).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, electrostatic charge, airflow patterns,
            and the presence of localized dust sources.
        pcb:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. It may also exhibit signs of chemical
            reactions with the PCB materials, such as corrosion or discoloration. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points (e.g., component leads).
            It then spreads outward from these points, gradually covering the surface. Edges tend to accumulate dust faster
            than the center. Uniform gradual accumulation also occurs on horizontal surfaces. Layering effects can be observed,
            especially with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Timeframes: Visible film within days,
            significant buildup within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Medium gray-brown
            (#808069) with localized darker patches of soot (#000000) and reddish-brown iron oxide stains (#A62A2A). Areas
            near corroded components may exhibit greenish hues (#90EE90) due to copper oxidation. Pollen can introduce yellow
            or orange specks (#FFC300).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially around component leads, edges of the PCB, and in crevices. Flat
            surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer. Airflow patterns can create streaks or directional deposits. Point
            sources of contamination (e.g., nearby machinery) result in radial or gradient patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic effects and
            airflow stagnation. Crevices and areas around components also accumulate more dust. Top surfaces generally have
            higher concentrations than bottom surfaces due to settling. Exposed areas collect more dust than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin film. Light (10-30%): A faint grayish haze,
            1-5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring some surface details, 5-25 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%):
            A thick, obscuring layer, 25-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): A very thick crust, significantly altering the surface
            appearance, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on PCBs typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a dominant grayish-brown
            hue. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly sticky depending on humidity and organic content. Coverage varies
            significantly, often concentrating around edges and components.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation due to electrostatic attraction and airflow. 3) Point source spreading from nearby equipment. 4)
            Gradient from source, decreasing concentration with distance. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow
            or surface contamination. 6) Streaky/linear patterns aligned with airflow or component placement.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The center areas tend to have a more uniform, but often lighter, coating. This is because edges
            act as collection points for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a uniform layer. Vertical surfaces may exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points. Components create sheltered areas with varying dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Settling on horizontal surfaces is a dominant effect. Runs down slopes are common, especially
            with moisture present. Dust tends to hang from overhead surfaces in small clumps.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal reflection. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Oily or sticky dust may exhibit a slight sheen. The presence
            of metallic particles can create small specular reflections.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is powdery and easily disturbed. With increased humidity or the presence of
            oils, it becomes slightly sticky and can form a cohesive layer. Under magnification, individual particles of varying
            sizes and shapes are visible. The surface can feel slightly abrasive depending on the particle size distribution.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1-10 μm for a light coating to 50-200 μm for heavy buildup. In extreme
            cases, thickness can exceed 500 μm, resembling a thin crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Discrete patches around components.
            3) Spots/dots of concentrated dust. 4) Stains from liquid contaminants mixed with dust. 5) Buildups in crevices
            and corners. 6) Drip marks on vertical surfaces (if moisture is present).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on airflow patterns, electrostatic charge distribution,
            and the presence of localized contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical
            surfaces.
        peek:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated. The color shifts from light gray to brownish-gray,
            and the texture becomes more crusty and adherent. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust begins to accumulate
            at contact points and edges. After weeks, the dust spreads inward from the edges, forming a more uniform layer.
            Over months, the layer thickens and consolidates, becoming more difficult to remove. Seasonal variations in dust
            concentration and humidity can lead to layering effects, with distinct layers of different colors and textures.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5DC). Slightly aged: Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of yellow-brown. Moderately aged: Light brown (#A68B64) with reddish undertones due to iron oxide. Heavily aged:
            Dark brownish-gray (#848482) with localized dark spots from soot (#000000).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. On horizontal surfaces, a relatively uniform layer forms, while on vertical surfaces, streaks
            and drip marks are common. Point sources of contamination (e.g., nearby machinery) can lead to radial or fan-shaped
            patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered areas
            exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due
            to gravity. Flat surfaces accumulate a more uniform layer than curved surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A faint haze or film, slightly dulling the surface, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original surface texture, thickness 5-15 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            opaque layer, significantly altering the surface appearance, thickness 15-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick,
            crusty layer, completely obscuring the original surface, thickness >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on PEEK typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light gray to brownish-gray. The dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices and along edges,
            creating visible patterns and variations in color intensity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces in low-airflow
            environments), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (radial patterns from
            a single source), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution
            due to localized contamination), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to gravity and airflow). Edge accumulation
            and uniform coating are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter of the PEEK part often shows a higher concentration of dust compared to the
            central areas. This is because edges act as collection points for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling them over time. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces experience drip marks and streaking. Edges act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations.
            Depressions and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles
            on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, following the contours of the surface.
            Minimal hanging from overhead surfaces due to PEEK's relatively low surface energy.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The presence of soot can create localized dark spots
            that absorb light, while areas with higher concentrations of silica may appear slightly brighter. No significant
            iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x),
            individual particles are visible, ranging in size from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface feels
            slightly rough, similar to fine sandpaper (grit ~220). In humid conditions, the dust can become slightly sticky
            or crusty.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of <1 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 50-200 μm in sheltered
            areas. Typical thickness on exposed surfaces is 5-25 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas
            with high humidity), discrete patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles),
            stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (at edges and in crevices),
            drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on environmental conditions. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations is possible on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately
            patchy is typical on vertical surfaces or in areas with variable airflow. Highly variable/irregular is common
            near point sources of contamination. Uniformity is primarily affected by airflow, surface orientation, and proximity
            to contamination sources.
        pet:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a light, easily removable layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly bound to the PET surface, often exhibiting color changes due to chemical
            reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness builds up over time, and the texture can become more crusty or
            compacted.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days
            and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible in sheltered environments. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur due
            to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup can occur within months, especially
            in dusty environments.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones. Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C) with
            reddish-brown patches due to iron oxide. Heavy buildup: Dark Brown (#8B4513) with possible black soot deposits
            (#000000). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-Green (#9ACD32) mixed with gray. Industrial dust: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9) with
            possible metallic sheen.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, localized spots near ventilation
            sources, streaks on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation, and drip marks. Accumulation is often observed
            at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow stagnation.
            Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal samples may have
            higher concentrations than bottom surfaces due to settling from above.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A barely visible dusting, appearing as a slight haze. Thickness: 1-5 μm.
            Light (10-30%): A thin, but noticeable layer. The PET surface is still clearly visible. Thickness: 5-15 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A significant layer that obscures the PET surface to some extent. Thickness: 15-30 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            A thick layer that largely obscures the PET surface. Thickness: 30-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, opaque
            layer that completely obscures the PET surface. Thickness: >50 μm, potentially reaching several hundred μm in
            localized areas.'
          description: Environmental dust on PET typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            ranging from light gray to brownish-gray. Coverage patterns vary widely depending on the environment, but often
            exhibit edge accumulation and streaking due to airflow and gravity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (common on horizontal surfaces indoors),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (due
            to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow stagnation. The center areas tend to have lower concentrations, especially on large, flat surfaces. This
            is because edges act as collection points for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic charge. It builds up in
            crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity and condensation. It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction. It follows contours to some
            extent, but sharp edges tend to accumulate more dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rain or condensation washing dust downwards. Settling on horizontal
            surfaces is a primary mechanism for dust accumulation. Runs down slopes are observed, with thicker deposits at
            the bottom.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a slightly dull, grayish appearance. Heavy buildup may exhibit a slight sheen due to compacted particles.
            No significant iridescence is typically observed unless specific metallic particles are present.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual particles
            are visible, creating a granular texture. Depending on humidity, can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under high
            magnification (500x+), individual particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen, angular mineral fragments) are
            discernible.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (sparse coverage) to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm (extreme
            coverage). In extreme cases, localized buildup can reach up to 500 μm or more, especially in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on most surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to water flow), discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles
            or small clusters), stains (if dust reacts with the PET surface), uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations is possible on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately patchy distribution is common in
            outdoor environments. Highly variable/irregular distribution is typical near point sources or in areas with complex
            airflow. Uniformity is influenced by airflow, electrostatic charge, and surface orientation.
        phenolic resin composites:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Light, powdery, easily removed. Aged contamination (months/years):
            Darker, more compacted, harder to remove, potentially forming a thin, hardened crust. Color shifts towards darker
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and around imperfections. Over time,
            the film thickens and spreads, eventually covering more of the surface. Point sources expand outward, creating
            localized patches. Layering effects occur as new dust settles on top of older layers. Seasonal variations in dust
            concentration and humidity influence the rate and pattern of buildup. This process can take days to months to
            years.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C), Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark gray
            (#4A4A4A), Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA), Iron oxide-rich areas: Burnt Sienna (#E97451).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include edge accumulation, localized spots around surface imperfections, and streaks
            on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. Dust also tends to settle more heavily on horizontal surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas also exhibit higher concentrations.
            Top surfaces exposed to the environment generally have more dust than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            dusting, slightly alters surface color, 10-30 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, obscures original
            surface color, 30-60 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage, original surface barely visible, 60-100
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick layer, significantly alters surface appearance, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on phenolic resin composites typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer
            with a dominant color range of light brown to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends
            to accumulate in crevices and edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            2) Edge accumulation (very common), 3) Point source spreading (around vents or openings), 4) Gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface imperfections), 6)
            Streaky/linear (due to rain or cleaning).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            charge buildup. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more
            uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaks. Edges act
            as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Depressions and surface imperfections trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust. Slopes exhibit runs of dust, with thicker
            accumulation at the bottom. Overhead surfaces may have dust hanging from them, especially in areas with high humidity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the variations in color and texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At close range, individual
            particles may be visible, giving a slightly granular appearance. Depending on humidity, it can become slightly
            sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavier
            buildup of 50-200 μm in areas of accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces, 2) Thick crusts in sheltered areas,
            3) Discrete patches around imperfections, 4) Spots/dots from individual particles, 5) Stains from water runoff
            carrying dissolved contaminants, 6) Buildups in corners and crevices, 7) Drip marks on vertical surfaces.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, surface roughness, electrostatic
            charge, and the presence of localized sources of contamination.
        pine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and more difficult to remove. The color shifts towards deeper
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more consolidated.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly. Over time, these
            particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces.
            Seasonal variations in dust concentration and humidity influence the rate of buildup. Layering effects may occur
            due to alternating periods of high and low dust deposition. The timeframe for significant buildup can range from
            days to months, depending on environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E9DBC7) with subtle grey undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted ochre
            (#C2B280) to a reddish-brown (#A0785A) due to iron oxide accumulation. Soot-rich areas: Dark grey (#4A4A4A) to
            almost black (#222222). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-green tint (#D0D6B5) during pollen seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks from rainwater runoff. Sheltered areas tend to have thicker, more uniform
            coatings compared to exposed areas. Wind direction influences the distribution, creating directional patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces tend to have more dust than bottom surfaces
            due to settling. Corners and areas near potential dust sources (e.g., roads, construction sites) exhibit the highest
            concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            coating, easily disturbed, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, obscures the original surface
            texture, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring most of the original surface, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, significantly alters the appearance, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on pine presents as a heterogeneous layer, typically dominated by earthy tones ranging
            from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture varies from a fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular surface,
            depending on humidity and age. Coverage is rarely uniform, favoring crevices and sheltered areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very sheltered areas),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due
            to rain), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around small openings).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating. This edge accumulation is a very common
            characteristic.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas allow for even deposition. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, trapping
            dust particles. Depressions and indentations fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs and streaks.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Soot-rich areas appear darker and absorb more light.
            The overall appearance is generally non-reflective.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and fine, similar to talc. Over time, moisture and organic matter
            can cause it to become slightly sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a granular texture with visible particles
            of varying sizes (1-50 μm). The surface is generally rough, especially with heavier buildup.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup (100-500
            μm) in sheltered crevices and corners. Extreme cases with years of accumulation can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture), discrete patches (due to uneven
            airflow), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains (from organic matter), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (in corners), and no crystalline structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is extremely rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of crevices
            or obstructions. Sheltered areas tend to be more uniform than exposed areas.
        plaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time (months/years), the
            dust layer thickens and becomes more deeply embedded in the plaster's surface. Color shifts from light gray to
            darker browns and grays. Aged dust is more difficult to remove and may stain the plaster.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust begins to accumulate
            at contact points (edges, corners). Over weeks, the dust spreads inward from the edges. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources (e.g., vents) create expanding outward patterns. Layering effects
            occur with seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen in spring).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3). Aged dust: Yellowish-brown (#A07A55) due to iron oxide.
            Soot-rich areas: Dark gray (#4A4A4A). Pollen-rich areas: Pale yellow (#FAFAD2). Heavily soiled areas: Dark brown
            (#654321).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in corners, along edges, and in any surface imperfections. Vertical surfaces
            exhibit streaks from water runoff carrying dust downwards. Horizontal surfaces collect a more uniform layer. Areas
            sheltered from wind and rain accumulate dust more readily.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces of horizontal features accumulate more dust than undersides. Crevices and surface
            imperfections act as traps for dust particles. Vertical walls tend to have lighter concentrations overall, except
            for areas with water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, slight dulling of the plaster. Thickness: <10 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Subtle discoloration, visible only upon close inspection. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            discoloration, edges and crevices are clearly defined. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration,
            plaster color is obscured in many areas. Thickness: 200-400 μm. Extreme (>85%): Plaster color is almost completely
            obscured, thick layer of dust. Thickness: >400 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on plaster presents as a fine, matte layer that subtly alters the base color. The
            dust layer tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating darker, more pronounced areas. The overall
            appearance is a dulling of the plaster's original finish, shifting towards earth tones.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along walls and trim, point source spreading from vents or windows, gradient from source (e.g., darker near a
            road), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, and streaky/linear patterns from water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer. This is because edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles carried by air currents.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices and surface imperfections, acting as traps. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces
            experience drip marks. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Depressions fill with dust
            over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to water runoff. Horizontal surfaces experience settling. Runs
            down slopes are observed. Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces; it detaches and falls.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, highlighting surface imperfections
            and variations in color. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust seem less
            noticeable. The finish is generally matte, with no significant sheen or gloss unless the plaster itself has a
            glossy finish underneath.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine, almost velvety to the touch when lightly deposited.
            Heavier accumulations can feel slightly gritty due to the presence of larger particles like sand or mineral fragments.
            In humid environments, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, particularly
            in sheltered areas, buildup can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            from water, discrete patches in sheltered areas, spots/dots from individual dust particles, stains from embedded
            dust, and buildups in corners and crevices. No crystalline structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Uniformity varies depending on the location
            and exposure. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces. Areas near windows or vents
            are less uniform due to localized dust sources. Sheltered areas are more uniform than exposed areas.
        platinum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination (months/years)
            becomes darker, more consolidated, and harder to remove. Iron oxide components oxidize, leading to a more pronounced
            reddish-brown hue. Thickness increases, and the texture can become more crusty or granular.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Layering effects
            can occur with seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen in spring). The rate of buildup depends on
            environmental conditions (dust concentration, humidity, wind speed).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to light tan (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Medium reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) due to iron oxide oxidation. Dust with soot: Dark grayish-brown (#4F4F4F). Dust with pollen: Yellowish-tan
            (#EEE8AA). Dust with calcium carbonate: Off-white (#FAF9F6) with grayish undertones.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges. On vertical surfaces, streaks
            and drip marks are common. Flat, horizontal surfaces accumulate dust more uniformly. Areas sheltered from wind
            and rain exhibit heavier deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns and
            electrostatic attraction. Top surfaces of horizontal platinum pieces will have more dust than the bottom. Sheltered
            areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy layer. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, but platinum surface still visible. Thickness:
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant obscuring of the platinum surface. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Almost complete coverage, thick layer. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on platinum typically appears as a matte, grayish-brown to reddish-brown layer.
            The texture ranges from fine powder to a slightly crusty or granular deposit, depending on humidity and the presence
            of organic binders. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a complete coating, influenced by surface orientation
            and airflow.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along perimeters. 3) Point source spreading from localized contamination sources (e.g., bird droppings).
            4) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with
            uneven airflow.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The perimeter acts as a collection point for airborne particles. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces promote
            dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks
            on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Runs develop down slopes.
            Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a more muted color. Soot-rich dust absorbs light, appearing darker. Mineral-rich dust can exhibit slight
            reflectivity. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and loose. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
            Under magnification (100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral
            fragments, spherical pollen grains, and irregular soot aggregates. The surface is generally rough, with a matte
            finish.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas. 3) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4) Discrete patches where water has evaporated. 5) Stains from dissolved
            contaminants. 6) Buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. On horizontal surfaces sheltered from wind, the distribution
            can be mostly uniform with minor variations. On vertical surfaces, the distribution is highly variable/irregular
            due to gravity and water runoff. Edges and crevices tend to have higher concentrations, leading to non-uniformity.
        plywood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation of iron compounds
            and accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually, and the texture becomes coarser. Mold growth
            may become visible as dark, irregular patches.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges (hours/days).
            It then spreads outward from these points, gradually covering the surface (days/weeks). Edges continue to accumulate
            more dust than the center. Over months, layering effects become visible, with distinct strata of dust from different
            deposition events. Seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates can create noticeable changes
            in the dust layer's appearance.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E8DAB2) with a slight grey tint. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted Yellow-Ochre
            (#C69B44) to a Rust-Orange (#B7410E) depending on iron oxide content. Soot presence shifts the color towards a
            Greyish-Brown (#847059). Areas with moisture exposure may exhibit darker, almost black, patches due to mold growth
            or increased organic matter accumulation.'
          common_patterns: The dust tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices of the plywood due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, while vertical surfaces often show streaks
            or drip marks from rainwater or condensation. Point sources of dust (e.g., nearby construction) can create radial
            patterns spreading outward.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Top surfaces exposed to direct dust fallout have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and
            areas near dust sources exhibit the heaviest buildup. Vertical walls tend to have lower concentrations except
            where streaking occurs.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <10 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy coating, wood grain still clearly visible. Thickness: 10-30 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coating,
            wood grain partially obscured. Thickness: 30-75 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, almost complete coverage, wood grain
            largely obscured. Thickness: 75-150 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, complete coverage, wood grain completely obscured.
            Thickness: >150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on plywood typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to reddish-brown. The coverage varies from sparse speckling to a complete coating, often
            accumulating more heavily in crevices and along edges. The dust layer obscures the underlying wood grain to varying
            degrees depending on thickness.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along the perimeter. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution in areas with uneven exposure. 5) Gradient from source, with higher concentration near dust sources.
            Edge accumulation and uniform coating on horizontal surfaces are the most prevalent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. The edges act as a physical barrier, trapping airborne particles. The center areas may have
            a more uniform but thinner coating. This edge preference is a dominant characteristic.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for more uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and surface irregularities collect dust more readily.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust from above. Slopes exhibit runs of dust-laden
            water. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but gravity eventually causes it to fall.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to flatten the color and reduce the visibility of subtle texture variations. The presence of soot
            can create a slightly darker, more light-absorbing surface. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from a fine, powdery feel when freshly deposited to a slightly gritty or even
            crusty texture with age and moisture exposure. At a microscopic level, individual dust particles are visible,
            creating a slightly rough surface. The dust layer generally conforms to the underlying wood grain, accentuating
            it slightly if the layer is thin.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on exposure and time. A thin film can be as little as
            5-25 μm. Moderate buildup ranges from 50-150 μm. Heavy accumulation can reach 250 μm to 1 mm, especially in sheltered
            areas or along edges.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Thick crusts along edges and
            in crevices. 3) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4) Discrete patches in areas with localized contamination. 5)
            Stains from water runoff carrying dissolved contaminants. 6) Buildups in sheltered areas protected from rain.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Horizontal surfaces
            tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces. The presence of crevices, edges, and variations in surface texture
            disrupts uniform deposition. Wind and rain patterns also contribute to non-uniformity.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker browns and reds
            due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases over time, potentially leading to visible layering.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects become visible over months. Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration
            influence the buildup rate.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC), Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C), Rust-tinged dust: Burnt Sienna (#E97451),
            Soot-heavy dust: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-brown (#C04000).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to rainwater runoff, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Edges tend to collect more dust due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. Point source spreading occurs around vents or openings.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit
            the highest concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations than sheltered bottom
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, slightly obscuring the surface, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscuring details,
            thickness 25-75 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly obscuring the surface, thickness 75-150 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crust-like layer, almost completely obscuring the surface, thickness > 150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on polycarbonate typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by surface geometry
            and airflow, leading to variations in thickness and concentration across the surface. The dust layer obscures
            the underlying clarity of the polycarbonate.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around vents), streaky/linear (on vertical
            surfaces due to rain), localized concentrations (in crevices), and gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance from a dust source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The center of large flat surfaces tends to have lower concentrations unless sheltered. The perimeter
            often shows a higher concentration band.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks. Edges act as collection points.
            Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling. Runs down slopes are common. Dust does not hang
            from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the uneven distribution and subtle color variations. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oily contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution.
            It feels dry to the touch. At close range (10x magnification), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes
            are visible. Aged dust can become slightly compacted and harder to remove.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, accumulation
            in sheltered areas can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on smooth surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to water runoff), discrete patches (around point sources), spots/dots (from individual particles),
            stains (from organic matter), and buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on airflow, surface orientation, and proximity to dust sources. Sheltered
            horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than exposed vertical surfaces.
        polyester resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly bound to the surface, darker in color (due to oxidation and UV degradation
            of organic components), and potentially thicker due to continuous accumulation. It can also develop a slightly
            crusty or hardened texture.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and becomes
            more visible. Edges and crevices accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces. Over months, the dust layer hardens
            and becomes more difficult to remove. Seasonal variations in dust composition and weather patterns can lead to
            layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray-brown (#A29B90). Slightly aged: Tan (#D2B48C). Moderate dust: Reddish-brown
            (#C04000). Aged dust (high iron content): Burnt Sienna (#E97451). Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to rainwater runoff, accumulation in corners and crevices, and localized spots from point sources (e.g., bird
            droppings). Edges and raised features tend to accumulate more dust due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. The bottom edges of vertical panels often exhibit higher
            concentrations due to gravity-driven runoff. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film, 1-10 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Lightly
            visible layer, slightly alters surface color, 10-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures original
            surface color, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily visible layer, significantly alters surface appearance,
            100-250 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, completely obscures original surface, 250-500+ μm
            thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on polyester resin composites typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer
            with a dominant color range from light gray-brown to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust
            tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2)
            Edge accumulation along raised features and panel edges. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to
            rainwater. 4) Patchy/spotty distribution from localized sources (e.g., bird droppings, industrial emissions).
            5) Gradient from source, decreasing concentration with distance from the source.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            wind patterns. The perimeter of a panel often shows a higher concentration compared to the center. This is especially
            true for raised edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces experience drip marks and streaks. Edges act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow of dust particles, pooling at bottom
            edges, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. The angle
            of a sloped surface affects the rate of dust accumulation and runoff.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the granular texture and color variations. Depending on the composition, some dust layers
            may exhibit a slight sheen due to the presence of fine particles.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At close range, individual
            particles may be visible, creating a granular appearance. It can range from smooth (thin layer) to rough (thick
            buildup). The presence of organic material can make it slightly sticky, especially in humid conditions.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (sparse coverage) to a heavy buildup of 50-500
            μm (extreme coverage). In extreme cases, particularly in sheltered areas, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on smooth surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas where moisture accumulates. 3) Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4) Discrete patches from
            localized sources. 5) Buildups in corners and crevices. 6) Stains from organic components that have leached into
            the resin.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on the surface orientation, exposure to wind and rain, and proximity
            to dust sources. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered areas tend to have the most uniform coverage.
        polyethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Over time, the dust compacts, adheres
            more strongly, and darkens in color. Organic components decompose, contributing to a darker, more stained appearance.
            Thickness increases gradually, and the texture becomes more consolidated.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at edges
            and corners. After weeks, a noticeable layer forms on horizontal surfaces. Over months, the dust compacts, darkens,
            and thickens, with layering effects visible in sheltered areas. Seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g.,
            pollen in spring) can create distinct layers.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C)
            with localized areas of reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Heavily soiled (months): Dark Grayish-Brown
            (#4A4444) with possible black soot deposits (#000000). Areas exposed to moisture may exhibit a greenish tinge
            due to algae growth.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform. Horizontal surfaces tend to collect a thicker, more even layer.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks. Edges and corners accumulate dust more readily due to electrostatic
            effects and airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Sheltered areas (e.g., undersides of ledges) can
            have significantly higher concentrations than exposed areas. Top surfaces exposed to rain will have lower concentrations
            than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            dusting, surface texture still visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, surface texture
            partially obscured. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Near-complete coverage, surface texture largely obscured.
            Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, obscuring layer, significant buildup. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on polyethylene typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light gray to brownish-gray. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a near-uniform coating,
            influenced by surface orientation and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Uniform coating (horizontal surfaces indoors), Edge accumulation
            (all surfaces), Point source spreading (near vents or openings), Streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain
            or condensation), Patchy/spotty (uneven exposure), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance
            from a dust source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The perimeter of a polyethylene sheet or object will often have a visibly darker and thicker dust layer
            than the central areas.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more even layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection points.
            Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and streaks.
            Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Runs down slopes are common. Overhead surfaces
            accumulate less dust unless there is significant upward airflow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with a matte finish that diffuses
            light. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust less noticeable. No significant
            iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed unless oil-based contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. At close range (10x magnification), individual
            particles are visible, ranging from fine silt to coarser grains (5-50 μm). The surface is generally matte, lacking
            significant gloss unless wetted. Aged dust can become slightly crusty due to compaction and moisture.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (sparse film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). A light dusting is often <25
            μm. Heavy accumulation can reach 1 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (initial deposition), Drip marks (vertical surfaces),
            Runs/streaks (vertical surfaces), Discrete patches (uneven exposure), Spots/dots (individual particle deposition),
            Stains (organic component decomposition), Buildups (sheltered areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare except in controlled environments. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation,
            electrostatic charge, and the presence of surface imperfections.
        polyimide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the polyimide surface. Color shifts towards
            darker browns and grays due to the accumulation of organic matter and the oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness
            increases over time, and the texture can become slightly crusty in areas with high humidity.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup can occur within months in heavily polluted environments.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellowish tint due to pollen. Aged dust: Munsell
            5YR 4/4 (Moderate Brown) with reddish-brown (#A0785A) edges due to iron oxide. Soot concentration: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A)
            to Black (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Gray (#C8C8A9). Calcium Carbonate rich areas: Off-White (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, accumulation along edges and in
            crevices, and streaking on vertical surfaces due to gravity and rain. Point source contamination (e.g., near vents)
            leads to radial or gradient patterns. Electrostatic attraction can cause relatively uniform distribution, especially
            with finer particles.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and air flow patterns. Top surfaces generally accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered
            areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit streaking patterns, with higher concentrations
            at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a more uniform layer. Exposed areas are subject to wind and rain,
            which can reduce dust accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated particles or small patches, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            discontinuous film, slightly altering the surface appearance, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            layer, obscuring the original surface texture, thickness 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous layer, significantly
            altering the surface color and texture, thickness 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring the original
            surface completely, potentially forming crusts or buildups, thickness >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on polyimide typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light grays to brownish-grays, often with localized darker patches of soot or organic material.
            The distribution varies significantly based on the environment and orientation of the polyimide surface, ranging
            from uniform coatings to highly localized accumulations.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces in sheltered
            environments), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and air currents), point source spreading (radial
            patterns from vents or machinery), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven deposition due to wind or rain), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and
            air flow patterns. The mechanism is that edges act as charge concentrators, attracting charged dust particles.
            Air currents also tend to deposit particles at edges where flow is disrupted.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling depressions. On flat areas, it forms a relatively uniform layer. On vertical
            surfaces, it drips and streaks downwards. It collects at edges due to electrostatic forces. It follows contours
            to some extent. The physical reasons are related to airflow patterns, electrostatic forces, and gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common phenomenon. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes, creating streaks. Quantitatively, the settling velocity of particles can be estimated using
            Stokes' Law, but this is highly dependent on particle size and density.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal specular reflection. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Darker areas of soot absorb more light, appearing even
            darker. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed unless there is a thin film of oil
            present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine to slightly gritty depending on the particle size distribution.
            It generally feels dry to the touch. At higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes (spherical
            pollen, angular mineral fragments, fibrous organic material) are visible. The surface is generally matte, not
            glossy.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in relatively clean environments to a heavy
            buildup of 50-200 μm in heavily polluted areas. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses
            of up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (uniform coatings), thick crusts (in areas with high
            humidity and mineral content), discrete patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual particles or small
            aggregates), stains (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (horizontal surfaces), buildups (at edges
            and in crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor
            variations is possible in controlled environments. Moderately patchy is common in outdoor settings. Highly variable/irregular
            is typical near sources of contamination or in areas exposed to wind and rain. The uniformity level is primarily
            determined by air currents, electrostatic forces, and the presence of localized contamination sources.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic matter decomposition),
            and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the dust may become slightly hardened or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days
            and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur due
            to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Significant buildup can occur within months, especially
            in dusty environments.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Medium brown (#A67B5B)
            with rust-orange undertones (#B7410E) due to iron oxide. Soot-heavy areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich
            areas: Yellowish-brown (#C9AE5D). Areas with high CaCO₃: Off-white (#FAF9F6).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity and rain, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Point source spreading occurs around localized
            contamination sources. Edges and raised features tend to accumulate more dust due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow disruption.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            settling. Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            disruption. Crevices and sheltered areas also exhibit higher concentrations. Top surfaces of horizontal components
            tend to have more dust than bottom surfaces. Exposed areas subject to wind and rain may have lower concentrations
            than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy film. Thickness: 5-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, but the underlying surface is still visible.
            Thickness: 10-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coating, obscuring much of the underlying surface. Thickness:
            25-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Near-complete coverage, with a thick, obscuring layer. Thickness: 50-200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on polypropylene typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light to medium browns and grays. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a near-uniform coating,
            influenced by surface geometry and airflow patterns. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on
            vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners). Edge accumulation
            and uniform coating are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            disruption. The mechanism is that edges act as charge concentrators, attracting charged dust particles. The perimeter
            of a surface also tends to accumulate more dust than the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up on flat areas due to settling. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Dust collects at edges
            due to electrostatic effects. It follows contours to some extent, but sharp edges tend to accumulate more dust
            than smooth curves. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common due to rain or condensation. Dust settles on
            horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture
            or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with subtle variations in color
            and texture becoming visible. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust seem
            more uniform in color. The dust layer is generally matte, with minimal sheen or gloss. Soot-rich areas may exhibit
            a slight dull sheen.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution.
            It feels dry to the touch. At close range (10x magnification), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes
            are visible. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss unless moisture is present.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (sparse coverage) to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm
            (extreme coverage). In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach up to 1 mm in crevices or sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on most surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation), discrete patches (due to localized contamination),
            spots/dots (due to airborne particles), stains (if moisture is present), uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces), buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations is common on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately patchy distribution occurs in areas
            with uneven airflow. Highly variable/irregular distribution is seen in exposed areas subject to wind and rain.
            The uniformity level is primarily determined by airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the presence of localized
            contamination sources.
        polystyrene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted, darker in color (shifting towards browns and grays), and more difficult
            to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the texture can become crustier.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and becomes
            more noticeable. Edges and corners accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces. After months, the dust layer becomes
            compacted and darker, with potential layering effects from seasonal variations in dust composition. Point sources
            expand outward over time.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC), Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C), Soot-heavy dust: Dark grayish-brown
            (#4A4444), Iron-rich dust: Reddish-brown (#A0785A), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Point source spreading is also observed near vents or openings.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier accumulation
            due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Top surfaces exposed to settling dust have higher concentrations
            than sheltered undersides. Crevices and indentations act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, a very light dusting. Light (10-30%): a thin, easily disturbed
            layer, thickness around 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): a noticeable layer, slightly obscuring the surface, thickness
            around 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): a thick, easily visible layer, significantly obscuring the surface, thickness
            around 20-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): a very thick, crusty layer, almost completely obscuring the surface, thickness
            exceeding 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on polystyrene typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to brownish-gray. The distribution is often uneven, with heavier accumulation in crevices
            and along edges, creating a subtle gradient effect.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (along edges and corners), point source spreading (radiating from vents), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (irregular distribution), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to gravity). Edge
            accumulation and uniform coating are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to electrostatic
            attraction and reduced airflow. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is due to
            the edge effect, where electric fields are stronger at sharp corners and edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic forces. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces experience
            drip marks. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling, leading to thicker accumulation. Slopes
            exhibit runs down the incline. Overhead surfaces may have dust hanging precariously.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with a matte finish and minimal
            gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to wash out the color, making the dust appear lighter and less noticeable.
            No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and slightly gritty to somewhat sticky depending on humidity and
            organic content. It feels fine-grained with a slight resistance when touched. At close range, individual particles
            are visible, creating a slightly rough surface.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 50-200
            μm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on smooth surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            discrete patches (irregularly distributed), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (where moisture is present),
            uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices). Drip marks and thin films are common.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, and electrostatic charge. Horizontal surfaces tend to
            have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        polytetrafluoroethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light dusting, easily removed. Aged contamination becomes more
            adhered to the surface, with color darkening due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases
            over time, leading to a more pronounced texture and potential for crust formation. Organic matter can decompose,
            leading to darker, stickier deposits.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Accumulation begins at contact points
            (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads outward. Over days, the dust layer thickens, and color changes become
            more apparent. Over months, the dust layer can become quite thick, especially in sheltered areas. Seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) to Tan (#D2B48C). Aged dust (weeks): Yellow-Brown (#A07A48)
            due to iron oxide oxidation. Heavily contaminated: Reddish-Brown (#8B4513) if iron-rich soil is present. Soot-heavy:
            Dark Gray (#4A4A4A) to Black (#000000) in industrial areas.'
          common_patterns: Non-uniform coating is the most common pattern. Accumulation at edges and corners due to electrostatic
            effects and surface tension. Streaks and drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces. Localized spots and patches
            are common, especially around potential sources of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Edges and corners tend to have the heaviest concentration due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling.
            Sheltered areas (e.g., under overhangs) can have significantly higher concentrations than exposed areas. Crevices
            and surface defects act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            graying or browning, 5-10 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct color change, visible texture, 10-30 μm thick.
            Heavy (60-85%): Significant color change, thick layer, 30-50 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete obscuring
            of the PTFE surface, very thick layer, >50 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on PTFE typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light gray to reddish-brown, depending on the local soil composition. The hydrophobic nature of PTFE
            causes uneven distribution, often accumulating at edges and in crevices, rather than forming a uniform coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Most common patterns are: Edge accumulation (due to electrostatic charge), Point source
            spreading (from nearby sources), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), Patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven deposition), Streaky/linear (due to wind or water runoff). Uniform coating is rare on PTFE due
            to its hydrophobic nature.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic charge concentration
            and airflow patterns. The center areas tend to have a lighter, more scattered distribution. This is due to the
            hydrophobic nature of PTFE, which prevents uniform wetting and adhesion.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to have a more even, but still non-uniform, distribution. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks
            and streaks. Edges collect dust due to electrostatic charge concentration. Depressions and surface defects act
            as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled dust. Runs down slopes are common. Dust can hang
            from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas, but this is less common on PTFE due to its low surface energy.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle color variations and highlights the uneven distribution. No iridescence is typically observed unless
            specific metallic contaminants are present (rare). The dust layer reduces the reflectivity of the PTFE surface.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual particles
            are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface is not smooth; it has a slightly
            rough, matte finish. The texture can become crusty with prolonged exposure to moisture and subsequent drying.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-50 μm. Heavy buildup: 50-200 μm. Extreme buildup (rare):
            >200 μm, potentially reaching 1 mm in sheltered areas with continuous deposition.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: Thin films (initial deposition), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            Runs/streaks (due to water runoff), Discrete patches (localized contamination), Spots/dots (individual particle
            deposition), Stains (from dissolved contaminants), Buildups (in corners and crevices). Thick crusts can form in
            areas with repeated wetting and drying.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is the most accurate description. The hydrophobic nature of PTFE
            prevents uniform wetting and adhesion of dust particles. Electrostatic charges and surface irregularities further
            contribute to non-uniformity. Wind and rain patterns also influence the distribution.
        polyvinyl chloride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker browns and reds
            due to oxidation of iron compounds and accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases noticeably.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects become visible over weeks/months, with seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0) with hints of gray. Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A07A5A) with darker
            brown (#604020) in crevices. Heavily soiled: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E) with black soot deposits (#000000). Pollen-rich:
            Yellowish-Tan (#FAF0BE) with green undertones.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Edges and raised features tend to collect more dust due to
            electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal elements
            accumulate more dust than undersides. Vertical surfaces show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Almost imperceptible, slight dulling of the PVC surface. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film, color change barely noticeable, thickness <10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable color change, visible
            texture, thickness 10-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant color change, thick layer, obscuring original surface,
            thickness 100-300 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring original surface, thickness >300
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on PVC typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thicker,
            more noticeable coating, often accumulating in crevices and along edges. The overall appearance is dulling and
            obscures the original PVC surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along perimeters. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution in areas with uneven exposure. 5) Localized concentrations around point sources of contamination
            (e.g., vents, machinery).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter of a PVC sheet or object will often have a higher concentration of dust compared
            to the central areas. This is especially noticeable after prolonged exposure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions and indentations trap dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Runs develop
            down slopes. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and slightly reflective, with minimal gloss.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the dust distribution. No iridescence is typically
            observed unless specific industrial contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is powdery and fine, almost velvety to the touch. Over time, moisture and
            compaction can create a slightly crusty or gritty surface. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mix of fine
            particles. Feels slightly abrasive when heavily accumulated.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas or crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces. 3) Pools/puddles of dust in depressions or on horizontal surfaces. 4) Thick crusts in areas
            with repeated wetting and drying. 5) Discrete patches or spots where dust has adhered to sticky residues.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on airflow, surface orientation, and proximity to dust sources. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        poplar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation
            of iron compounds and accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases, and the texture can become more crusty
            or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is common in sheltered
            areas. Point sources (e.g., nearby construction) create expanding patterns. Layering effects occur due to seasonal
            variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Months/years lead to significant crusting and compaction.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            reddish-brown (#A0785A) to a darker, slightly orange-tinged brown (#8B4513) due to iron oxide. Soot presence can
            shift the color towards a dark gray (#4A4A4A). Pollen can add a yellowish-green tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaking due to rainwater runoff. Initial deposition often appears as a fine, even coating,
            which then thickens in specific areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend to have lower concentrations
            than undersides. Corners and areas near potential dust sources (e.g., roads, construction sites) exhibit higher
            concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            even coating, slightly obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer,
            obscuring some of the underlying texture. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significantly
            altering the appearance of the surface. Thickness: 100-300 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, completely
            obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: >300 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on poplar presents as a generally matte, light-to-medium brown coating. The texture
            is typically powdery or slightly gritty. Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a near-uniform layer, depending
            on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (light contamination), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns), point source spreading (from nearby construction or industrial
            activity), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition due
            to surface irregularities), streaky/linear (due to rainwater runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and wind patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Center areas may experience
            more even distribution but lower overall concentration compared to edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles.
            Depressions and surface irregularities provide sheltered areas for dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks
            as dust is washed away by rainwater.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the variations in color and texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to silt. Depending on humidity and organic
            content, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under magnification (10x or greater), individual particles of
            varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular mineral fragments and rounded pollen grains.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to rainwater), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity), discrete patches (uneven
            deposition), stains (where dust has dissolved and penetrated the wood), uniform coatings (light contamination),
            buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies from mostly uniform with minor variations (light contamination) to moderately
            patchy (moderate contamination) to highly variable/irregular (heavy contamination). Uniformity is affected by
            wind patterns, surface roughness, and the presence of sheltered areas.
        porcelain:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable powder. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the porcelain surface. Color darkens due
            to the accumulation of organic matter and the oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases, and the texture
            can become noticeably rougher.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens gradually
            over time, with the rate depending on environmental conditions. Accumulation often begins at contact points and
            edges before spreading inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is common on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand
            outward, creating circular or radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates. Timeframes range from hours for initial film formation to months/years for significant buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B8F). Aged dust: Medium brown (#796955). Soot-rich areas:
            Dark grayish-brown (#4A4440). Iron-rich areas: Reddish-brown (#8B4513). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-brown (#C19A6B).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity and rainwater runoff. Areas sheltered from wind and rain
            tend to have thicker, more uniform coatings.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces of horizontal features accumulate more dust than undersides. Sheltered areas
            exhibit higher concentrations than exposed areas. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity
            and runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, slightly alters surface color, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures original surface
            details, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significantly alters surface appearance, 50-100
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, completely obscures original surface, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on porcelain typically presents as a matte, light-to-medium brown or grayish-brown
            layer. The texture ranges from a fine powder to a slightly crusty film, depending on humidity and the presence
            of organic matter. Coverage varies significantly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along corners and seams, point source spreading from vents or openings, gradient from source with decreasing concentration,
            patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rain runoff,
            localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The perimeter of a porcelain object often exhibits a darker, more defined line of dust compared
            to the central areas. This effect is particularly noticeable on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, filling depressions and following contours. On flat areas, it pools and forms a relatively uniform
            layer. On vertical surfaces, it drips and forms streaks. It collects at edges, creating a defined border.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces, forming a layer that thickens over time. Runs down slopes are observed, and dust can hang from overhead
            surfaces in sheltered areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the grayish tones. Areas with higher concentrations of organic matter may exhibit a slight
            sheen. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels like a fine, dry powder. With moisture, it can become slightly sticky
            or crusty. Under magnification (100x), individual particles of SiO₂ appear as angular, translucent grains, while
            carbon black forms amorphous aggregates. Organic matter contributes a slightly greasy feel.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            100-500 μm in sheltered areas or crevices. Extreme cases in industrial settings can reach up to 1 mm in very sheltered
            locations.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by rainwater,
            pools/puddles in depressions, thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete patches
            around point sources, spots/dots from individual particles, stains from dissolved contaminants, uniform coatings
            on horizontal surfaces, buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven airflow, surface geometry, and the presence of localized
            sources of contamination.
        porphyry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, darker in color, and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases
            over time, and staining from iron oxides becomes more pronounced. Lichen growth may occur on very old, undisturbed
            dust layers.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges. Over weeks, the film thickens and spreads. Over months, localized accumulations form in sheltered
            areas and crevices. Layering effects occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            Rain events can wash away some dust, but also redistribute it, leading to streaking and drip marks.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90) with subtle reddish hues. Aged dust: Darker, muted
            brown (#4A4441) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining from iron oxide. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black
            (#333333). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#D2B48C). Areas with calcium carbonate: Whitish-gray (#F0F0F0).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Sheltered areas
            accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices, and lighter on exposed
            flat surfaces. Top surfaces of horizontal features accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and sheltered
            areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls have higher concentrations near the top due to runoff
            from above.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, minimal color change. Light (10-30%): Subtle discoloration,
            dust visible upon close inspection, thickness <10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable color change, granular texture
            visible, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant color change, thick layer, obscuring original surface
            texture, thickness 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscuring original surface, thickness
            >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on porphyry typically presents as a matte, slightly granular layer with a dominant
            color range of muted browns and grays, often with reddish or yellowish undertones due to iron oxides. Coverage
            varies significantly depending on exposure and surface orientation, ranging from sparse films to thick, localized
            accumulations.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along borders and crevices, point source spreading from bird droppings or other localized sources, gradient from
            source (e.g., decreasing dust concentration with distance from a road), patchy/spotty distribution due to wind
            and rain patterns, and streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to reduced wind exposure, electrostatic attraction, and the tendency of water to flow along edges, carrying dust
            particles with it. Center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water runoff. Flat areas
            pool dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges collect dust due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns.
            Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled dust. Runs down slopes are common. Dust hangs
            from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas, forming cobweb-like structures.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle color variations and highlights the granular texture. Damp dust may exhibit a slight sheen. Soot-rich
            areas absorb light, appearing darker under all lighting conditions.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine, powdery (like talc) when dry to slightly sticky or crusty when damp.
            At close range, individual dust particles are visible as a granular surface. The feel is generally rough, especially
            with thicker accumulations. Crystalline structures may be present in areas with high calcium carbonate content.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) to heavy buildup (up to 500 μm or more) in sheltered
            areas or crevices. Typical thickness on exposed flat surfaces is 25-100 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks caused by water runoff,
            thin films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete patches around point sources, stains
            from iron oxide, and buildups in crevices and corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low due to variations in surface texture, exposure to wind and rain, and the presence of localized sources
            of contamination. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        praseodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more consolidated, and potentially harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases over time, and the texture becomes more
            crusty.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles deposited randomly on the surface
            (hours). Over time, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer (days). Dust accumulates preferentially
            at edges and in crevices (days-weeks). The layer thickens gradually, and the color darkens due to oxidation and
            accumulation of soot (weeks-months). Seasonal variations in dust concentration and humidity can lead to layering
            effects, with distinct bands of different colors and textures (months-years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E8DAB2), Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark gray
            (#4A4A4A), Pollen concentration: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32), Iron oxide staining: Rust-orange (#B7410E).'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms localized spots and streaks, especially on vertical surfaces where gravity
            causes downward movement. Accumulation is often heavier in sheltered areas and crevices, while exposed surfaces
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling.
            Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Bottom edges of vertical surfaces often
            exhibit the heaviest buildup due to downward migration of dust particles.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Visual appearance is mostly clean praseodymium with scattered dust particles
            (1-5 μm thickness). Light (10-30%): A thin, barely visible film of dust covers the surface (5-15 μm thickness).
            Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer of dust is present, obscuring some of the underlying praseodymium (15-50
            μm thickness). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer of dust covers most of the surface (50-100 μm thickness).
            Extreme (>85%): A very thick, consolidated layer of dust completely obscures the underlying praseodymium (100-200+
            μm thickness).'
          description: Environmental dust on praseodymium typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating in crevices
            and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (dust collects along edges due to
            electrostatic forces and airflow patterns), Point source spreading (dust radiates outward from a specific source),
            Streaky/linear (dust forms streaks due to gravity and airflow), Localized concentrations (dust accumulates in
            specific areas due to surface irregularities), Patchy/spotty (dust forms discrete patches due to uneven deposition).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points, attracting and retaining dust particles. Center areas may
            have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges
            act as collection points, leading to increased dust buildup. Depressions and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to gravitational settling. Sloped surfaces
            exhibit runs and streaks as dust is carried downward by gravity and moisture.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the uneven distribution. Soot particles may create a slight
            sheen in localized areas.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly crusty or granular
            as it ages and absorbs moisture. It feels gritty to the touch. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous
            mixture of particle shapes and sizes, including angular mineral fragments and rounded organic particles.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm or more in areas of accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (uniform coatings on flat surfaces), Drip marks (vertical
            streaks caused by water runoff carrying dust), Discrete patches (localized areas of dust accumulation), Spots/dots
            (small, isolated dust particles), Stains (discoloration caused by dust reacting with the praseodymium surface),
            Buildups (thick accumulations in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by airflow patterns, surface geometry, electrostatic charge, and the presence of localized dust sources.
            Flat, horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than complex geometries.
        ptfe:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable powder. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly bound to the PTFE surface, often requiring mechanical cleaning. Color darkens
            due to the accumulation of organic matter and chemical reactions with atmospheric pollutants. The texture can
            transition from powdery to slightly crusty or even stained.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles that gradually thickens over time. Accumulation
            often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is
            possible in sheltered environments. Point sources of contamination can expand outward, creating localized patches.
            Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Significant buildup
            can occur within days in heavily polluted environments, while it may take months or years in cleaner areas.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to pale tan (#E9C2A6). Aged contamination: Ranges
            from a muted reddish-brown (#A0785A) to a darker, slightly greyish brown (#6B5441) if soot is present. Areas with
            high iron oxide content may exhibit a rust-orange hue (#B7410E). Pollen can add a yellowish tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity and
            electrostatic forces. Wind and airflow patterns can create streaks or localized concentrations. On vertical surfaces,
            light dustings may appear relatively uniform, while heavier accumulations can form drip marks or runs.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Sheltered
            areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal PTFE accumulate more dust than bottom
            surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dusting, individual particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, translucent layer, surface texture still visible, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): Opaque layer, surface texture partially obscured, thickness 10-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, noticeable
            layer, surface texture largely obscured, thickness 25-75 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, surface
            texture completely obscured, thickness >75 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on PTFE typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan to reddish-brown,
            depending on the local soil composition and air pollution. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often highlighting
            surface imperfections and edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to electrostatic charge), point
            source spreading (from localized contamination sources), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to wind or water runoff), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic charge concentration
            and airflow patterns. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of dust. This effect is more
            pronounced on smaller PTFE components.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and runs. Edges
            act as collection points, leading to a buildup of dust along the perimeter.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to a more uniform accumulation. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges and in depressions. Runs down slopes are common after rain or condensation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant and reveals subtle color variations.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust look more uniformly greyish-brown.
            The surface is generally matte, with minimal sheen or gloss unless moisture is present.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust layer feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. With moisture absorption,
            it can become slightly sticky or form a thin, hardened crust. At a microscopic level, individual particles are
            angular and irregular, with sizes ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface is generally
            matte, lacking significant gloss.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a barely visible film (sub-micrometer) to a heavy buildup of several hundred
            micrometers (250-500 μm) in areas of high accumulation. A typical light dusting might be 1-10 μm thick, while
            a moderate accumulation could be 25-75 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            of high accumulation and moisture), discrete patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual
            particles), stains (from absorbed liquids), uniform coatings (on sheltered surfaces), drip marks (on vertical
            surfaces), and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on environmental conditions and surface orientation.
            On vertical surfaces sheltered from wind, the distribution can be mostly uniform with minor variations. On exposed
            surfaces, the distribution is often moderately patchy or highly variable/irregular due to wind and rain. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        pvc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, adheres more strongly to the PVC surface, and exhibits a darker, more
            ingrained color. The thickness increases, and the texture becomes rougher due to the incorporation of more particles
            and potential chemical reactions with the PVC surface.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins
            at contact points or edges and spreads inward (days-weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Point sources expand outward (weeks-months). Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations,
            where different types of dust are deposited at different times of the year (months-years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            brownish-gray (#848482) to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide content. Soot-heavy areas: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9)
            to almost Black (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Gray (#C0C0C0) with a slight green tint.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaking on vertical surfaces
            due to rainwater runoff, and accumulation in crevices and corners. Edges and raised features tend to collect more
            dust due to electrostatic attraction and acting as barriers to airflow.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center areas. Top surfaces of horizontal elements receive
            more dust than the undersides. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Crevices and indentations
            act as traps for dust particles.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very thin film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%): A slightly
            noticeable haze, still translucent (5-15 μm). Moderate (30-60%): A visible layer, obscuring the original PVC color
            (15-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer, significantly altering the PVC appearance (50-150 μm). Extreme
            (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, potentially obscuring surface details (150+ μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on PVC typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant color
            range from light gray to brownish-gray. The distribution varies significantly depending on the PVC's orientation
            and exposure, ranging from a thin, almost invisible film to a noticeable buildup in sheltered areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (all surfaces), point source spreading (near vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven airflow), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain), localized concentrations
            (crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            the edge effect, where airflow is disrupted, leading to particle deposition. The center areas of flat surfaces
            tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner, layer of dust. This behavior is driven by a combination of airflow
            dynamics and surface charge distribution.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices act
            as traps, preventing dust from being easily removed. Flat areas allow for uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces
            experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Contours influence
            airflow, leading to variations in dust deposition.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven water runoff. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust and water mixtures. Overhead surfaces may accumulate
            dust, but it is more prone to falling off due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the variations in color and texture. The presence of soot can create darker, less reflective
            areas. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become somewhat crusty, especially if exposed to moisture and subsequent drying.
            Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous mixture of particle shapes and sizes.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1-10 μm for a light film to 50-200 μm for a moderate buildup, and
            can exceed 500 μm in areas with heavy accumulation or prolonged exposure. In extreme cases, buildup can reach
            1-2 mm in sheltered corners.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), drip marks (vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (vertical surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces in sheltered areas), thick crusts (areas
            exposed to moisture and drying), discrete patches (uneven airflow), spots/dots (individual particle deposition),
            stains (chemical reactions with PVC), uniform coatings (horizontal surfaces), buildups (corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform distribution,
            while vertical surfaces are typically moderately patchy due to gravity and airflow. Crevices and corners exhibit
            highly variable concentrations. The uniformity level is primarily influenced by airflow patterns, surface orientation,
            and the frequency of cleaning or rainfall.
        pyrex:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a light, easily removable powder. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and more difficult to remove. It may develop a slightly crusty
            or cemented texture due to the binding action of moisture and organic matter. The color shifts towards darker
            browns and grays as organic matter decomposes and binds to the mineral particles.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles settling on the surface (hours). It then
            thickens gradually as more particles accumulate (days). Accumulation often begins at contact points (edges, corners)
            and then spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Layering
            effects can be observed over longer periods (months/years), with distinct layers of dust from different sources
            or time periods. Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration can influence the buildup rate and
            appearance.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to light tan (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Medium brown (#A67B5B) with
            reddish-brown undertones due to iron oxides. Soot-rich dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to black (#000000) in localized
            areas. Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA) with a slight greenish tinge.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates more heavily along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust than vertical surfaces, where
            gravity causes streaking. Point sources of contamination (e.g., nearby vents) can create radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow stagnation. Top surfaces tend to collect more dust than bottom surfaces in enclosed spaces. Crevices
            and indentations act as traps for dust accumulation. Flat horizontal surfaces collect a more uniform layer than
            vertical walls. Exposed areas near vents or openings have higher concentrations than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and particles, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy film, slightly obscuring the surface. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating, partially obscuring the surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, significantly obscuring
            the surface. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring the surface completely. Thickness: >50
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Pyrex typically appears as a light to medium brown or grayish-brown coating.
            The texture ranges from a fine powder to a slightly gritty film, depending on the composition and age of the dust.
            Coverage varies from sparse speckling to a near-complete coating, often accumulating more heavily in corners and
            along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along perimeters, point source spreading from vents or openings, gradient from source with decreasing concentration
            further away, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity and moisture, localized concentrations in corners and crevices.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The edges of the Pyrex object act as collection points for airborne particles. The center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer of dust. This behavior is primarily driven by electrostatic forces
            and airflow dynamics.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation and electrostatic forces. It builds up in
            crevices and indentations, acting as traps. It pools on flat horizontal areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity and moisture. It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction. It follows contours
            to some extent, but sharp edges tend to accumulate more dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, following the
            path of least resistance. Does not hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more visible due to increased contrast. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to wash out the color slightly. The dust layer is generally matte, with no significant sheen or
            gloss unless it contains oily or greasy contaminants. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive when fresh. Over time, moisture and organic matter can cause
            it to become sticky or crusty. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles of varying sizes and shapes
            are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and fibrous organic debris. The surface
            is generally matte, not glossy.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-5 μm) in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup (50-200
            μm) in heavily contaminated areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered corners.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            due to gravity and moisture, discrete patches in areas with uneven airflow, spots/dots from individual particles
            settling, stains from organic matter binding to the surface, uniform coatings on sheltered horizontal surfaces,
            buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies depending on the environment. Horizontal surfaces in enclosed spaces tend
            to have mostly uniform distribution with minor variations. Vertical surfaces and surfaces exposed to airflow are
            typically moderately patchy. Areas near contamination sources are highly variable/irregular. The uniformity level
            is primarily determined by airflow patterns, electrostatic forces, and gravity.
        quartz glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is light in color and easily removed. Aged contamination (months/years
            old) becomes darker (more reddish-brown or gray), more consolidated, and harder to remove. Thickness increases,
            and the dust can become embedded in microscopic surface imperfections.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles adhering to the surface. Over time, more
            particles accumulate, thickening the layer. Accumulation often begins at contact points or edges and then spreads
            inward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. This process
            can take hours for a barely visible layer, days for a light layer, and months for a heavy buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E3DAC9 (light beige-gray). Light dust: #D2B48C (tan). Moderate dust: #A98D6C (medium
            brown). Aged dust: #8B4513 (saddle brown). Soot-heavy dust: #36454F (charcoal gray).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Point source spreading is also common near
            vents or construction activity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces exposed to settling dust have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides.
            Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity and runoff. Crevices and surface imperfections
            act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, a faint haze. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): a noticeable
            but thin layer. Thickness: 5-15 μm. Moderate (30-60%): a clearly visible layer, obscuring some of the glass''s
            clarity. Thickness: 15-30 μm. Heavy (60-85%): a thick, opaque layer. Thickness: 30-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): a very
            thick, obscuring layer. Thickness: 50-200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on quartz glass typically appears as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan
            to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, with heavier accumulation in crevices and along edges. Over
            time, it can become more consolidated and darker in color.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns), point source spreading (around vents or
            construction sites), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven
            surface adhesion), streaky/linear (due to rain or condensation runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices
            or corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The perimeter of the glass often shows a higher concentration than the center areas, especially on large
            surfaces. This is because edges are more exposed to airflow and attract charged particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It pools on flat areas, especially if moisture is present. On vertical surfaces, it drips and streaks downwards.
            Edges act as collection points, creating a visible perimeter of dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling, leading to a more uniform coating.
            Slopes exhibit runs, and overhead surfaces may have dust hanging due to electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and diffuses the light, reducing the glass's
            transparency. Indoor fluorescent lighting highlights the uneven distribution and any streaks or patterns. A slight
            sheen may be visible on areas with organic binder components.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is powdery and fine, easily disturbed. With moisture and time, it can become
            slightly sticky or crusty. At a microscopic level, individual particles are visible, ranging from sub-micron to
            tens of micrometers in size. It feels gritty to the touch when heavily accumulated.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (sparse) to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm (extreme).
            In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated
            wetting and drying), discrete patches (due to localized adhesion), spots/dots (individual dust particles), stains
            (from dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. On sheltered horizontal surfaces, it can be mostly uniform with
            minor variations. On vertical surfaces, it is typically moderately patchy or highly variable due to gravity and
            runoff. Exposed surfaces are more likely to have irregular distribution due to wind and rain.
        quartzite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adheres more strongly to the surface, and may exhibit a darker,
            more reddish-brown color due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases over time, leading to a more
            pronounced texture.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles deposited on the surface (hours).
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more uniform. After weeks, dust begins to accumulate in crevices and
            along edges. Months of exposure lead to the formation of thicker crusts and stains, with layering effects visible
            in sheltered areas. Seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen) can create distinct layers.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust (low iron): #C0B283 (khaki), Aged dust (high iron): #A0785A
            (sienna), Soot-rich dust: #36454F (charcoal grey), Pollen-rich dust (seasonal): #E4D00A (golden yellow cast)'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in surface irregularities, such as grain boundaries and micro-fractures.
            On inclined surfaces, it forms streaks and drip marks. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, while
            vertical surfaces show greater variation due to gravity and wind effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and sheltered
            areas exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity and runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): a faint haze, slightly obscuring the underlying material, thickness 5-20 μm.
            Moderate (30-60%): a noticeable layer, partially obscuring the underlying material, thickness 20-50 μm. Heavy
            (60-85%): a thick layer, significantly obscuring the underlying material, thickness 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            a very thick layer, almost completely obscuring the underlying material, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on quartzite typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color ranging
            from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices
            and along edges, creating a slightly textured surface that obscures the natural crystalline structure of the quartzite.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces in sheltered
            environments), edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns), point source spreading (around
            vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source), patchy/spotty
            (uneven deposition due to surface irregularities), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The perimeter of the quartzite often exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the
            center areas. This effect is more pronounced in sheltered environments.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling depressions and obscuring surface details. Flat areas tend to collect a more
            uniform layer of dust. Drips form on vertical surfaces, following the contours of the material.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common on exposed surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating
            a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, with increased contrast between
            clean and contaminated areas. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, reducing contrast.
            The surface is generally matte, with minimal sheen or gloss. Soot-rich dust may exhibit a slight darkening effect.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and slightly gritty to a more consolidated, almost crusty feel
            with age. At close range (10x magnification), individual dust particles are visible, often angular and irregular.
            The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss unless wetted.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, such
            as sheltered areas with minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages of contamination), thick crusts (aged
            contamination in sheltered areas), discrete patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual dust particles
            or aggregates), stains (discoloration due to chemical reactions), drip marks (vertical surfaces), buildups (accumulation
            in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered environments tend to be
            mostly uniform with minor variations. Vertical surfaces and exposed areas are typically moderately patchy to highly
            variable/irregular due to wind, rain, and gravity. Uniformity is influenced by surface roughness, exposure to
            weather, and the source of the dust.
        redwood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, the dust becomes more
            compacted and adheres more strongly to the redwood surface. Color deepens as organic matter decomposes and iron
            oxides oxidize. The layer can thicken, and in sheltered areas, may develop a slightly crusty or cemented texture
            due to moisture and mineral deposition.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges (hours/days).
            It then spreads gradually across the surface, thickening over time (days/weeks). Edges tend to accumulate dust
            faster than center areas. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates (months). The dust becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface as it ages.
          color_variations: Fresh dust exhibits a light tan (#D2B48C) to pale yellow (#F0E68C) hue. As it ages and incorporates
            more organic matter and iron oxides, it shifts towards a muted ochre (#C7B03B), eventually developing rust-orange
            (#A0522D) or even reddish-brown (#8B4513) tones in areas with higher iron content or moisture. Soot deposition
            can introduce grey (#808080) or black (#000000) mottling.
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along the grain of the redwood, accentuating its natural texture. It
            also collects in corners, crevices, and around any raised features. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks
            may form due to rain or condensation. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            elements accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and areas sheltered from wind and rain exhibit higher
            concentrations. Vertical walls tend to have lower concentrations than horizontal surfaces, except where streaking
            occurs due to water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            but thin layer, accentuates grain, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, obscures some of the redwood''s
            original color, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly alters the redwood''s appearance, 50-100
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, almost completely obscures the redwood, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on redwood presents as a fine, matte layer, typically exhibiting a range of earthy
            tones. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating subtle shading variations across the
            redwood surface. Coverage varies from sparse to heavy depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in sheltered areas with
            consistent dust deposition), edge accumulation (very common, due to airflow and electrostatic effects), point
            source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from
            a dust source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture or localized contamination), streaky/linear (on vertical
            surfaces due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Center areas tend to have lower concentrations, especially
            on flat surfaces exposed to wind and rain. This is a very common pattern.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, filling depressions and accentuating the surface texture. Flat areas tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff. Edges act as collection
            points, leading to higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces, creating a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes are observed, with thicker accumulations at the bottom.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. The color appears
            more vibrant and the texture more pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the colors appear more muted
            and the texture less defined. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed unless oil or other contaminants
            are present.
          texture_details: The dust layer feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch due to the presence of silica and
            mineral particles. At low concentrations, it may be almost imperceptible. Higher concentrations can create a slightly
            rough or chalky texture. Under magnification, individual particles of varying sizes and shapes are visible, including
            angular mineral fragments and rounded pollen grains.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavier
            buildup of 50-200 μm in areas with significant accumulation. In extreme cases, such as sheltered horizontal surfaces,
            the dust layer can reach thicknesses of up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture), discrete patches (due to localized
            contamination), spots/dots (due to individual dust particles or pollen), stains (where moisture has dissolved
            dust components), uniform coatings (rare, in sheltered areas), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface texture, airflow patterns, moisture levels, and the proximity
            to dust sources. Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than exposed vertical surfaces.
        rhenium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time (weeks to months),
            the dust layer thickens and becomes more visible. Color shifts occur as iron oxides oxidize further, leading to
            a more pronounced reddish-brown hue. Aged dust can become compacted and harder to remove, forming a more cohesive
            layer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film that uniformly covers the surface. Over hours
            and days, dust particles gradually accumulate, thickening the layer. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly.
            After weeks and months, the dust layer becomes more visible and uneven, with streaks and localized concentrations
            forming. Seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen) can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D0CB) with hints of yellow-ochre (#C7B299). Aged dust: Shifts
            towards a muted reddish-brown (#A0785A) due to iron oxide accumulation, sometimes with darker soot deposits (#333333).
            Pollen can introduce yellow-green hues (#A2AD71) during certain seasons. Calcium carbonate can cause a chalky
            white appearance (#F5F5F5) in localized areas.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges due to gravity and airflow patterns.
            Streaks are common on vertical surfaces due to water runoff carrying dust particles. Flat horizontal surfaces
            exhibit more uniform coverage, while areas shielded from direct airflow may have less dust accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity and
            water runoff. Edges and corners also exhibit higher concentrations due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat horizontal surfaces generally have more uniform coverage, but sheltered areas may accumulate more dust than
            exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, appearing as a faint haze. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy film. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer with some areas of bare Rhenium
            still visible. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, continuous layer obscuring most of the Rhenium surface.
            Thickness: 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer completely covering the Rhenium surface. Thickness:
            >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Rhenium typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a muted, earthy
            tone. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often exhibiting streaks or localized concentrations, and the overall
            appearance is matte and non-reflective.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along perimeters, point source spreading from vents or openings, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces
            due to water runoff, patchy/spotty distribution in areas with irregular airflow, and localized concentrations
            in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, causing dust particles to deposit along the perimeter. The center areas
            tend to have slightly less dust accumulation, especially on larger surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect dust more uniformly. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as
            barriers, causing dust to accumulate along the perimeter. Depressions and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges. Runs down slopes are common. Overhead surfaces tend to have less dust accumulation unless there is an upward
            airflow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and non-reflective, scattering light diffusely.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the uneven distribution patterns. There
            is no significant sheen or iridescence unless specific contaminants (e.g., metallic particles) are present, which
            is atypical for environmental dust.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to silt. It feels slightly abrasive
            to the touch. At higher magnifications (SEM), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including
            spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and irregular soot aggregates. In humid environments, the
            dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers (μm) for light to moderate dust accumulation. Heavy buildup
            can reach 100-200 μm in sheltered areas. Extreme cases with years of accumulation can exceed 500 μm, but this
            is rare in regularly maintained industrial environments.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on exposed surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            discrete patches in areas with localized dust sources, stains from water runoff carrying dissolved contaminants,
            and buildups in crevices and corners. Thick crusts can form in humid environments where dust particles become
            cemented together.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due
            to variations in airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of localized dust sources. The level of uniformity
            depends heavily on the environmental conditions and the frequency of cleaning.
        rhodium:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a very thin, almost imperceptible haze, often only
            visible under oblique lighting. Aged contamination (months/years): Develops a thicker, more visible layer with
            a darker, more pronounced color. The texture becomes coarser as particles agglomerate and bind together.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more often it's point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and concentration (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with slight yellowish tint due to pollen. Aged dust: Ranges
            from Tan (#D2B48C) to a muted Burnt Sienna (#B7410E) if iron oxide is prevalent. Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9)
            to near Black (#000000) in extreme cases. Pollen-dominant dust: Pale Yellow (#FFFFE0).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in recessed areas, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces
            due to gravity. Initial deposition often appears as a thin, relatively uniform film, which then develops into
            localized concentrations and streaks as dust accumulates over time.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Crevices and recessed areas also accumulate more dust than flat, exposed surfaces. Top surfaces
            exposed to the environment will have higher concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a faint haze, barely visible to the naked eye, typically <1
            μm thick. Light (10-30%): A slightly more noticeable film, with some visible discoloration, 1-5 μm thick. Moderate
            (30-60%): A clearly visible layer with distinct color variations, 5-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque
            layer that obscures the underlying rhodium surface, 50-200 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer
            that completely covers the rhodium surface, >200 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on rhodium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            gray to brownish-gray, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often highlighting surface imperfections and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (initial deposition), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic effects and air currents), point source spreading (from localized dust sources), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to
            airflow or water runoff). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and air
            currents. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by air. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, especially in the initial stages of contamination. This is due to the 'edge effect' where
            electric fields are stronger at sharp corners and edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, trapping
            dust particles carried by air currents. Depressions and surface irregularities provide sheltered areas for dust
            accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes dust to settle on horizontal surfaces and accumulate at the bottom edges of vertical
            surfaces. Drip marks can form on vertical surfaces if moisture is present, carrying dust particles downwards.
            Horizontal surfaces will have a higher dust accumulation rate than vertical surfaces. The settling velocity of
            dust particles is influenced by their size and density.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to accentuate the uneven distribution of the dust. No iridescence is typically observed unless
            specific contaminants (e.g., certain metallic oxides) are present in significant concentrations, which is rare
            for typical environmental dust.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly abrasive to the touch. Under
            magnification (50x-100x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible, including angular silica,
            rounded pollen grains, and irregular carbon aggregates. It is not typically sticky unless moisture is present.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, light coating to several
            hundred micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach
            up to 1 mm thick.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles or small aggregates), stains (if moisture
            is present), uniform coatings (rare, initial stage), buildups (in corners and crevices), drip marks (if moisture
            is present).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in surface roughness, electrostatic charge, airflow patterns, and the distribution of
            dust sources. The presence of surface defects or contaminants can also influence dust accumulation.
        rosewood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks/months), the dust
            compacts and adheres more strongly to the surface, becoming more difficult to remove. Color may darken due to
            chemical reactions with the wood or absorption of moisture and organic matter. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: 'Dust buildup on rosewood progresses as follows: Initially, a thin film forms within hours
            of exposure. Over the next few days, dust accumulates at contact points and edges. Within weeks, the dust layer
            thickens and spreads, becoming more noticeable. After several months, the dust compacts and adheres more strongly,
            potentially forming a crust in humid environments. Seasonal variations in dust composition and humidity can lead
            to layering effects.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #A39788 (Grayish Taupe). Aged dust (with iron oxide): #8C7853 (Tan with reddish undertones).
            Soot-heavy dust: #4A4A4A (Dark Gray). Pollen-rich dust: #D4C29F (Light Yellowish-Tan). Calcium Carbonate rich
            dust: #F0E6D4 (Off-White).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to gravity and electrostatic
            attraction. Horizontal surfaces exhibit more uniform coverage, while vertical surfaces show streaking and drip
            marks. Areas sheltered from wind and rain accumulate dust more rapidly.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center areas. Crevices and indentations act as traps for
            dust particles, resulting in higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment may have lower concentrations
            due to rain washing.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A barely perceptible dusting, with individual particles visible under
            magnification. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy layer that partially obscures the underlying wood
            grain. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more noticeable layer that significantly obscures the wood grain.
            Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that almost completely obscures the wood grain. Thickness:
            50-150 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures the wood grain. Thickness: >150
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on rosewood presents as a fine, matte layer that subtly obscures the wood's natural
            grain. The color is typically a muted, grayish-brown, with variations depending on the local dust composition.
            Coverage ranges from sparse to nearly complete, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along corners and borders, point source spreading from localized contamination, streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity, patchy/spotty distribution in areas with uneven airflow, and localized concentrations
            in crevices and indentations.'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on rosewood. This
            is due to a combination of factors: airflow patterns that concentrate particles at boundaries, electrostatic attraction
            between dust and the edge of the material, and the tendency for edges to be less frequently cleaned. The center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.'
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow
            patterns and electrostatic attraction. Crevices act as traps, leading to higher concentrations. Flat areas allow
            for more uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges provide a boundary for dust
            accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to uniform
            accumulation. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Runs down slopes are common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The dust does not typically exhibit iridescence or rainbow
            effects unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine to the touch, similar to talcum powder. Depending on
            humidity, it can become slightly sticky or form a thin, barely perceptible crust. At high magnification (50x+),
            individual dust particles are visible, exhibiting angular and irregular shapes.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, dust
            can accumulate to thicknesses of 0.5-1 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            buildups in corners and crevices, discrete patches in areas with localized contamination, stains caused by dust
            mixed with moisture, and uniform coatings on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Crusts can form in humid environments.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on the environment. Horizontal surfaces in sheltered
            areas tend to have mostly uniform distribution with minor variations. Vertical surfaces and areas exposed to wind
            or rain exhibit moderately patchy distribution. Crevices and edges show highly variable/irregular concentrations.
        rubber:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery film with a relatively uniform color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, more compacted, and may exhibit staining of the rubber surface.
            The thickness increases, and the texture becomes rougher due to the incorporation of moisture and organic matter.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It begins at contact points (e.g.,
            raised features) and then spreads. Edges accumulate dust faster than flat surfaces. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward in a radial pattern. Layering effects are
            observed with seasonal variations, where each season deposits a new layer of dust with slightly different composition
            and color. Timeframe for significant buildup (moderate coverage) is typically weeks to months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E0CBA8 (Light Tan), Aged dust: #A07A55 (Medium Brown), Iron-rich dust: #B7410E (Rust-Orange),
            Soot-heavy dust: #4A4A4A (Dark Gray), Pollen-rich dust: #F0E68C (Khaki).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, accumulation in crevices and low
            points, streaks on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation runoff, and localized spots around point sources
            of contamination (e.g., nearby construction).
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to airflow patterns
            and particle trapping. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
            Corners accumulate dust due to eddy currents.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A light dusting, barely visible, with individual particles scattered across
            the surface (thickness < 1 μm). Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film that slightly obscures the original rubber
            color (thickness 1-5 μm). Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that significantly alters the rubber''s appearance,
            with some areas still visible (thickness 5-25 μm). Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that completely covers
            most of the rubber surface (thickness 25-100 μm). Extreme (>85%): A very thick, encrusted layer that obscures
            the original rubber texture (thickness >100 μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on rubber typically presents as a matte, slightly rough layer with a dominant color
            range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the local soil composition. The dust tends to accumulate in
            crevices and on horizontal surfaces, creating a non-uniform coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (around raised edges), point source spreading (radial pattern from a single source), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition),
            streaky/linear (due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns
            and particle trapping. The edges act as barriers, causing particles to deposit. The center areas, especially on
            flat surfaces, may have a more uniform but thinner coating.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and particle trapping. It builds up in crevices,
            filling depressions. It pools on flat areas, especially if there is moisture. It drips on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity. It collects at edges due to airflow patterns. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the
            rubber surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rainwater runoff. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            down slopes are observed. Dust does not typically hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic
            forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Wet dust may exhibit a slight sheen. No iridescence is typically
            observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine when freshly deposited to slightly crusty and compacted
            over time, especially when exposed to moisture. It feels gritty to the touch. At close range (10x magnification),
            individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible, including angular mineral fragments and spherical
            pollen grains.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm or more in areas of accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of water accumulation and evaporation), discrete patches
            (due to localized contamination sources), stains (from prolonged contact with dust and moisture), buildups (in
            crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on the exposure to wind, rain, and the surface orientation. Sheltered
            horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than exposed vertical surfaces.
        ruthenium:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a very thin, almost imperceptible film, primarily
            light gray. Aged contamination (months/years): Darkens in color, becoming more reddish-brown or even rust-colored.
            The texture becomes more compacted and potentially crusty, with increased thickness.'
          buildup_progression: The buildup progression typically starts as a thin film that gradually thickens over time.
            Dust initially accumulates at contact points and edges before spreading inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is
            possible in controlled environments, but more often, point sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur
            due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. This process can take hours for a barely
            visible film to form, days for a light coating, and months for a heavy buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5DC). Slightly aged: Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of yellow. Moderately aged: Light brown (#A68B64) with reddish undertones. Heavily aged: Rust-orange (#B7410E)
            mixed with dark brown (#654321) in areas of higher concentration.'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with localized spots and streaks. Accumulation is
            more pronounced in areas sheltered from wind or direct abrasion. Drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces,
            indicating the influence of moisture.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where dust particles are trapped.
            Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling. Sheltered areas
            exhibit higher concentrations compared to exposed areas. Corners and areas with complex geometry also tend to
            accumulate more dust.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very faint dusting, barely visible to the naked eye, with
            a thickness of <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film is visible, with a thickness of 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A more noticeable layer with distinct color variations, with a thickness of 5-15 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            almost opaque layer with significant color variations, with a thickness of 15-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick,
            crusty layer completely obscuring the underlying Ruthenium surface, with a thickness of >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Ruthenium typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            gray to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Non-uniform coating with varying thickness. 2)
            Edge accumulation along the perimeter of the Ruthenium surface. 3) Point source spreading from localized contamination
            sources. 4) Gradient from source, with decreasing concentration further away. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution due
            to uneven settling.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and the barrier
            effect of the edge itself. The center areas may have a more uniform but thinner layer of dust. The perimeter often
            exhibits a higher concentration of dust compared to the central region.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and particle trapping. Flat areas tend to have a more uniform but potentially thicker layer
            of dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and runs due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to
            accumulate along the perimeter.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker accumulations. Runs down
            slopes are also observed. Pooling occurs at bottom edges where dust accumulates due to gravity and airflow patterns.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained when dry. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch.
            At higher concentrations, it can become slightly crusty or compacted, especially if exposed to moisture. Under
            magnification, individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light dust to a heavy buildup of 25-100
            μm or more in areas of high accumulation. Extreme cases can reach several hundred micrometers (0.2-0.5 mm) in
            sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films covering the surface. 2) Discrete patches of dust
            in localized areas. 3) Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4) Buildups in corners and crevices.
            5) Stains caused by moisture interacting with the dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. It is rarely
            perfectly uniform due to variations in airflow, surface roughness, and the presence of crevices or edges that
            trap dust particles. The composition of the dust itself also contributes to non-uniformity.
        sandstone:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film with a tan color (#D2B48C).
            Aged contamination (months/years) darkens to a sienna or brown color (#A07A55 or #8B4513), becomes more tightly
            bound to the sandstone surface, and may develop a slightly hardened crust.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, light-colored film (hours/days). Dust accumulates at contact points
            and edges first (days/weeks). Over time, the film thickens and darkens, spreading inward from the edges (weeks/months).
            Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months/years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust: #A07A55 (sienna), Heavily soiled: #8B4513 (brown), Soot-rich:
            #36454F (charcoal gray), Iron-rich: #B7410E (rust-orange).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, localized spots around point sources
            (e.g., bird droppings), streaks on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff, and accumulation in crevices and
            porous areas of the sandstone.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to settling. Edges and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to wind and water channeling.
            Sheltered areas have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal features tend to accumulate
            more dust than the undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            tan film, 10-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct tan to light brown coating, 25-50 μm thickness. Heavy
            (60-85%): Dark brown coating, obscuring some of the sandstone texture, 50-100 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick,
            dark brown to black crust, significantly obscuring the sandstone, >100 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental Dust Layer on sandstone typically presents as a matte, slightly granular coating with
            a dominant color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges,
            creating a non-uniform coverage pattern that highlights the sandstone's texture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on sheltered horizontal surfaces.
            2) Edge accumulation along raised features and joints. 3) Point source spreading from bird droppings or other
            localized contamination sources. 4) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. 5) Patchy/spotty
            distribution in areas exposed to varying levels of wind and rain.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due
            to wind and water channeling, which deposit dust particles along these features. Flat, central areas tend to have
            a more uniform but thinner coating.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water channeling. Flat
            areas tend to pool dust, especially if slightly concave. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust carried by wind
            and water. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of airborne dust. Slopes exhibit runs of dust
            particles, with heavier accumulation at the bottom.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to wash out the color, making the dust appear lighter and less defined. Soot-rich areas may exhibit
            a slight sheen under oblique lighting.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At close range (10x magnification),
            individual particles of varying sizes (5-50 μm) are visible, creating a granular surface. In areas with higher
            moisture, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-25 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm in areas with significant accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas with high moisture. 3) Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4) Discrete patches around point
            sources. 5) Stains in porous areas where dust has penetrated the sandstone.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low due to variations in surface texture, exposure to weather, and proximity to contamination sources. Sheltered
            horizontal surfaces tend to have the most uniform coverage.
        sapphire glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color may darken due to chemical
            reactions and the incorporation of more organic matter. Thickness increases over time, and the dust may become
            more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It begins at contact points
            and edges, then spreads inward. Accumulation is generally gradual and uniform, but point sources can create localized
            areas of heavy buildup that expand outward over time. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and concentration. Timeframes: Hours for initial film formation, days for noticeable accumulation,
            months for significant buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with slight yellow tint due to pollen. Aged dust: Ranges from
            a muted brownish-gray (#848482) to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) if iron oxide is prevalent. Soot contamination: Dark
            gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#F0E68C).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. It also tends to settle on horizontal surfaces more readily than vertical ones. Streaks and drip marks
            may be present on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to electrostatic effects and
            airflow patterns. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Crevices and
            surface imperfections act as traps for dust particles, leading to higher concentrations in these areas. Top surfaces
            exposed to the environment generally have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very light dusting, barely visible to the naked eye. Thickness:
            <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, slightly visible film. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer
            that reduces transparency. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque layer that significantly obscures
            the surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures the surface.
            Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on sapphire glass typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color
            ranging from light gray to brownish-gray. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often highlighting surface imperfections
            and edges. The overall effect is a reduction in the glass's transparency and clarity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (very common),
            point source spreading (common near vents or openings), gradient from source (common near industrial emissions),
            patchy/spotty (common due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (common on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation),
            localized concentrations (common in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the air. The center areas tend to be cleaner
            due to less airflow and reduced electrostatic attraction.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than curved surfaces. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried
            by airflow. Depressions and scratches provide nucleation sites for dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker accumulations. Runs down slopes
            are common after rain or condensation. Dust particles may hang from overhead surfaces due to electrostatic attraction,
            but eventually fall due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more visible due to increased scattering of light.
            The surface appears matte and less reflective. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of
            the dust distribution. A slight sheen may be observed if the dust contains oily or waxy components.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it may feel almost imperceptible.
            Heavier accumulations can feel slightly gritty or rough. Under magnification, individual particles are visible,
            ranging from rounded to angular shapes. It is generally non-sticky unless organic matter is present.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light dust to 25-100 μm for heavy buildup.
            In extreme cases, particularly in industrial environments, buildup can reach 200-500 μm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with heavy accumulation and moisture), discrete
            patches (due to localized sources of contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles or small aggregates),
            stains (if the dust contains staining compounds).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven airflow, electrostatic charge variations on the surface,
            and the presence of surface imperfections that act as nucleation sites for dust accumulation.
        scandium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust compacts and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to the accumulation of organic matter
            and the oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases gradually, and the texture may become slightly crustier.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles settling on the surface (hours). Over
            days, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Edges and corners accumulate dust more rapidly.
            Over weeks to months, the dust layer thickens and compacts, with color changes due to oxidation and organic matter
            accumulation. Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Medium grayish-brown
            (#848482) with possible rust-orange (#C04000) tinges from iron oxide. Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray to black (#36454F).
            Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-gray (#C8C8A9).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaking on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity and moisture, and accumulation in corners and crevices. Edges often exhibit a slightly thicker
            buildup. Point source spreading can occur near ventilation ducts or other sources of dust generation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal areas
            will have more dust than the bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks of dust, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy layer, Scandium surface still clearly visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous
            layer, partially obscuring the Scandium surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Nearly complete coverage,
            Scandium surface largely obscured. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, obscuring layer, completely covering
            the Scandium surface. Thickness: >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Scandium typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a matte finish.
            The color is generally a muted grayish-brown, varying in intensity depending on the dust composition and exposure
            time. Coverage can range from sparse speckling to a nearly complete coating, often accumulating in crevices and
            along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation,
            point source spreading (radial pattern), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Center areas tend to have a more uniform, thinner
            layer of dust. This effect is more pronounced on flat surfaces and in areas with high airflow.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a uniform layer of dust. Vertical
            surfaces experience streaking and drip marks. Edges act as collection points, leading to thicker buildup. Depressions
            fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a uniform
            layer. Pooling occurs at bottom edges, leading to thicker accumulation. Runs down slopes are common, especially
            with moisture present.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the subtle color variations within the dust layer. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch, similar
            to talcum powder with embedded grit. At higher magnification, individual particles of varying shapes and sizes
            are visible. It is not typically sticky unless moisture is present.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers for light to moderate dust accumulation. Heavy
            buildup can reach 100-200 micrometers, especially in sheltered areas. Extreme accumulation can reach up to 500
            micrometers in very specific conditions.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on smooth surfaces, thick crusts in areas with high
            humidity or condensation, discrete patches where dust adheres preferentially, spots/dots from individual particles
            settling, stains from dissolved contaminants, uniform coatings on horizontal surfaces, buildups in corners and
            crevices, drip marks on vertical surfaces.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due to variations in airflow, surface roughness, and electrostatic charge.
            The uniformity level is influenced by the dust source and the environmental conditions.
        schist:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the schist surface. Color deepens over time,
            especially if organic matter is present, due to decomposition and chemical reactions. Thickness also increases
            with age.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days and weeks. It often begins at
            contact points (edges, crevices) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces. Point sources (e.g., bird droppings) expand outward over time. Layering effects are observed, especially
            in areas with seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen in spring). Months to years are required for
            significant crust formation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted tan (#D2B48C)
            to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) if iron oxides are prevalent. Soot presence shifts colors to dark gray (#A9A9A9)
            or even black (#000000) in localized areas. Pollen can introduce yellow-green hues (#9ACD32) during certain seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices and between the schist's foliations. Streaks and drip marks
            are observed on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer of dust compared to inclined or vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. Edges and crevices tend to have higher concentrations due to dust trapping. Top surfaces of exposed
            schist flakes accumulate more dust than undersides. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible dust, mostly individual particles. Light (10-30%): A thin
            film, slightly altering the schist''s color. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring some of the schist''s
            texture. Heavy (60-85%): A thick layer, significantly altering the schist''s color and texture, with thickness
            around 100-300 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick layer, completely obscuring the schist''s surface, with thickness
            exceeding 500 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on schist typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color range
            of light browns and grays, often exhibiting subtle variations due to the composition of the dust and the schist's
            inherent texture. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a slightly uneven coverage
            pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (dust collects along the edges of
            schist flakes), crevice filling (dust fills in the gaps between foliations), point source spreading (dust originates
            from a specific point and spreads outwards), gradient from source (dust concentration decreases with distance
            from the source), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to wind or rain patterns), and streaky/linear (dust is
            deposited in streaks due to water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to wind patterns
            and the trapping of particles. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform but often thinner
            layer of dust. This is due to the edges acting as barriers, preventing dust from being blown away.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water runoff. Flat areas
            tend to pool dust, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges collect
            dust due to their exposure to wind and their ability to trap particles. Contours influence the flow of water and
            dust, creating streaks and patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            settled dust. Runs down slopes are observed, with dust concentrating in lower areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly brighter and more reflective than the underlying
            schist. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, reducing contrast. A matte finish is generally
            observed, with minimal sheen unless the dust layer is very thin and the underlying schist is somewhat reflective.
          texture_details: The dust layer feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch due to the presence of silica and
            other mineral particles. At close range (10x magnification), individual dust particles are visible, ranging in
            size from 1 μm to 50 μm. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant gloss unless wetted.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm in lightly dusted areas to a buildup of 100-500
            μm in areas of heavy accumulation, such as crevices or sheltered locations. In extreme cases, buildup can reach
            1-2 mm in sheltered horizontal areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (a barely visible layer of dust), thick crusts (a hardened
            layer of dust, often found in sheltered areas), discrete patches (isolated areas of dust accumulation), spots/dots
            (small, individual dust particles), stains (discoloration of the schist surface due to dust penetration), drip
            marks (vertical streaks caused by water runoff), and buildups (accumulation of dust in specific areas, such as
            crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. It is rarely perfectly uniform due to the
            irregular surface of the schist and variations in wind and rain exposure. Uniformity is higher on smooth, horizontal
            surfaces compared to rough, vertical surfaces.
        serpentine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adhering more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases over time, and the texture becomes more
            crusty.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles that gradually thickens over time.
            Accumulation begins at contact points (edges, crevices) and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs in sheltered areas. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects are observed
            as new dust deposits on top of older layers. Seasonal variations in dust deposition rates can lead to distinct
            layers with different compositions and colors. Timeframes: noticeable film within days, significant buildup within
            months, thick crusts within years.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a slight yellowish tint. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            tan (#D2B48C) to a reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide accumulation. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to almost
            black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Can exhibit a slight yellow-green hue.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is most pronounced in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravitational settling and rainwater runoff. Areas sheltered from
            wind and rain tend to have thicker, more uniform dust layers.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat areas. Crevices and depressions act as traps for dust particles.
            Top surfaces exposed to the elements may have lower dust concentrations due to rain washing.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a light dusting, barely visible to the naked eye, thickness
            < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, easily disturbed layer, slightly obscuring the underlying serpentine, thickness
            5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, partially obscuring the serpentine, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy
            (60-85%): A thick layer, significantly obscuring the serpentine, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick layer, almost completely obscuring the serpentine, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on serpentine typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of muted browns and grays. Coverage varies from sparse dusting to near-complete obscuration of the
            underlying serpentine, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered areas), edge accumulation
            (due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance from a dust source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface
            texture), and streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to rain).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            wind patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Center areas may have lower
            dust concentrations due to wind scouring or rainwater runoff.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles.
            Depressions and pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks
            as dust is carried down by rainwater. Overhead surfaces may have dust hanging in loose aggregates.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the textured surface. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual dust
            particles are visible, ranging in size from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The texture is generally non-uniform,
            with some areas appearing smoother due to finer particle accumulation and others rougher due to larger, aggregated
            particles.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly dusted areas to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm in sheltered areas and crevices. Extreme buildup in long-neglected areas can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on lightly dusted surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            with heavy buildup and moisture), discrete patches (due to uneven surface texture), spots/dots (individual dust
            particles or small aggregates), stains (caused by dissolved contaminants), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            and buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Uniformity is affected by surface roughness,
            exposure to wind and rain, and the proximity to dust sources. Flat, sheltered surfaces tend to have more uniform
            dust layers than rough, exposed surfaces.
        shale:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust can become more compacted and adhered to the shale surface, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions
            (e.g., oxidation of iron). Aged dust may also develop a slightly crusty texture due to the precipitation of dissolved
            minerals.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles adhering to the surface (hours).
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more continuous. Dust begins to accumulate at contact points (e.g., surface
            irregularities) and spreads outward. Edges accumulate dust more rapidly than center areas. Layering effects can
            occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E9DBC7), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-oxide rich areas: Burnt Sienna (#E97451), Calcite-rich areas: Off-White (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from wind and rain.
            On inclined surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer
            of dust. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby stack) will create a gradient of dust concentration.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat areas due to wind turbulence and electrostatic attraction. Crevices
            and depressions act as traps for dust particles. Exposed areas are generally lighter than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated dust particles, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy layer, shale surface still clearly visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous
            layer, partially obscuring the shale surface. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, almost complete coverage,
            shale surface largely obscured. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring the shale surface
            completely, potential for crust formation. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on shale presents as a fine, particulate layer, typically exhibiting earthy tones
            ranging from light tan to reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a
            mottled or streaked appearance, especially on weathered surfaces. The texture varies from powdery to slightly
            crusty depending on humidity and composition.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to wind and electrostatic effects), point source spreading (radial pattern from a source),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture),
            streaky/linear (on inclined surfaces due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to wind turbulence and electrostatic
            effects. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner, layer of dust. Crevices
            near edges will have the highest concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat
            areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces are less prone to dust accumulation due
            to gravity and wind. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions and pits fill with dust over
            time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom on inclined surfaces. Vertical streaking is common due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal
            surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Runs down slopes create visible trails. Overhead surfaces may
            accumulate hanging dust formations, but this is less common on shale than on other materials.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the variations in color and texture. Areas with higher iron oxide content may exhibit a
            slight sheen. Soot-rich areas will appear darker and absorb more light.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch when dry. Can become slightly sticky or crusty when
            exposed to moisture. At close range, individual particles are visible, ranging in size from 1-50 μm. The surface
            is generally rough, with variations depending on the shale's inherent texture.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a thicker layer of
            50-500 μm in areas with heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1-2 mm in sheltered crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            with high humidity and mineral content), discrete patches (due to localized sources), spots/dots (individual dust
            particles adhering to the surface), stains (caused by dissolved minerals in rainwater), uniform coatings (on sheltered
            horizontal surfaces), buildups (in crevices and along edges), drip marks (on inclined surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface roughness, wind exposure, and the proximity to dust sources.
            Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to have the most uniform coverage.
        silicon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, almost imperceptible film, often light
            gray. Aged contamination (months/years) darkens in color, thickens, and can become more consolidated, forming
            a harder, more visible layer. Organic components may decompose, leading to color changes and increased stickiness.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens over time,
            with accumulation being faster in areas with higher dust concentration. The process often begins at contact points
            (edges, corners) and then spreads inward. Layering effects can occur due to intermittent dust deposition events.
            Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration can influence the buildup rate and appearance. Timeframes:
            Hours (initial thin film), Days (visible patchy layer), Months (significant buildup and color change).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5F5). Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C) with
            hints of reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Heavy accumulation: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with darker brown
            (#8B4513) edges. Soot-rich dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to black (#000000) in concentrated areas.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks caused by airflow or gravity, and accumulation
            in crevices and along edges. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer compared to vertical
            surfaces, where streaks and drip marks are more prevalent.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and physical trapping. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Top surfaces
            exposed to airflow may have less dust than sheltered areas. Corners and depressions act as collection points.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual particles or small clusters. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film, slightly dulling the silicon surface. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscuring the underlying
            silicon in some areas. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coverage, with a distinct color and texture change. Extreme
            (>85%): Almost complete coverage, forming a thick, opaque layer. Thickness correlates with coverage, ranging from
            sub-micrometer to hundreds of micrometers.'
          description: Environmental dust on silicon typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            gray to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. It often accumulates unevenly, influenced
            by gravity and surface features, creating a patchy or streaked appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (common due to electrostatic effects), point source spreading (from a localized source of contamination),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (irregular distribution), streaky/linear
            (due to airflow or gravity), localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and reduced
            airflow. The perimeter often shows a higher concentration compared to the center. This is especially true for
            freshly deposited dust.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection points.
            The dust tends to follow contours and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to the relatively low adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically has a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and variations in color. Soot-rich areas may appear
            darker and less reflective. No significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly abrasive.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become crusty or slightly sticky, especially if organic components are present.
            Microscopic examination reveals irregular particle shapes and sizes.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible to the naked eye) to several hundred micrometers
            (visible as a distinct layer). Typical range: 0.1 μm to 500 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 1-2 mm in extreme cases.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial stage), thick crusts (aged, heavy accumulation),
            discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (from liquid-borne contaminants),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (at edges and in crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks
            (due to gravity or airflow).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare outside of controlled deposition experiments. The non-uniformity is caused by variations
            in airflow, electrostatic charge, surface roughness, and the nature of the dust source.
        silicon carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time (weeks/months), the dust
            layer can become more compacted and adhered to the surface, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions
            and the incorporation of more organic matter. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates
            at contact points and edges, gradually spreading inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates. Months of exposure lead to a thicker, more compacted layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Ranges from reddish-brown (#A0522D)
            due to iron oxides, to dark gray (#4A4A4A) from soot, to yellowish-brown (#B8860B) if pollen is prevalent. Can
            also exhibit a chalky white (#F5F5F5) if calcium carbonate is a significant component.'
          common_patterns: Distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges.
            Vertical surfaces tend to have streaks or drip marks. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a more uniform layer. Proximity
            to dust sources significantly impacts the pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than the center of flat surfaces. Crevices and low-lying areas
            act as collection points. Top surfaces of horizontal components exposed to the environment will have higher concentrations
            than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin film,
            slightly alters surface appearance, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures original surface
            color, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, completely obscures original surface, thickness
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, may alter surface texture, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Silicon Carbide typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a matte
            finish. The color is usually a muted range of browns and grays, often with a slight reddish or yellowish tint
            depending on the local soil composition. Coverage can range from sparse to complete, influenced by surface orientation
            and exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation due to electrostatic attraction. 3) Point source spreading from nearby machinery or vents. 4) Streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation runoff. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with
            variable exposure.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            reduced airflow. The perimeter of a SiC wafer or component will often exhibit a higher concentration of dust compared
            to the center. This effect is more pronounced on smaller components and in environments with high electrostatic
            charge.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas allow for uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust along their perimeter. Depressions and
            pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Runs down
            slopes are common. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the particulate nature of the deposit. No iridescence
            is typically observed unless specific industrial contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch. At
            higher magnification (SEM), individual particles are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers.
            In humid environments, it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in crevices or areas
            with constant dust deposition.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on smooth surfaces. 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces. 3) Discrete patches and spots/dots where individual particles have landed. 4) Buildups in
            crevices and corners. 5) Stains where moisture has dissolved and redeposited contaminants. Thick crusts can form
            in areas with repeated wetting and drying cycles.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by airflow patterns, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and
            the proximity to dust sources. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        silicon carbide (sic):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation
            of iron). The texture can become harder and more difficult to remove, sometimes forming a cemented layer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, gradually spreading inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in sheltered environments. Point
            sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust
            composition and concentration. Months of exposure lead to thicker, more consolidated deposits.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust (low Fe content): Pale tan (#E5D7BA). Aged
            dust (high Fe content): Rust-orange (#B7410E) with brown edges (#704214). Soot-rich dust: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)
            to black (#000000). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#FAF0BE).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravity. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks or drip marks from water runoff. Areas sheltered from wind
            and rain tend to have thicker, more uniform deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. Crevices
            and depressions act as collection points, leading to localized heavy deposits. Top surfaces exposed to rain tend
            to have lower concentrations than sheltered bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, slightly visible, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, color change evident, thickness
            5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, obscuring underlying surface, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Thick, crusty deposit, completely obscuring surface, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on SiC typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a dull, matte finish.
            The color is usually a muted grayish-brown, tending towards reddish-brown in areas with higher iron oxide content.
            Coverage varies greatly depending on environmental conditions and surface orientation, ranging from sparse films
            to thick, uneven deposits.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered environments), edge
            accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns), point source spreading (around vents or openings),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface roughness),
            streaky/linear (due to water runoff), and localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions). Edge accumulation
            and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points, attracting and trapping airborne particles. This effect is more
            pronounced in areas with high dust concentrations and low airflow. The center areas tend to have thinner, more
            uniform deposits.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect dust more readily than sloped surfaces. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and
            streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Depressions and pits fill with dust over
            time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust, resulting in thicker deposits. Slopes exhibit
            runs and streaks as dust is carried downward by water. Overhead surfaces can accumulate dust, but the deposits
            are often thinner and more easily dislodged.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface irregularities. The presence of organic particulates
            can sometimes create a slight sheen or oily appearance.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            Heavy accumulations can form a crusty or slightly sticky surface, especially in humid environments. Microscopic
            examination reveals a heterogeneous mixture of particle shapes and sizes.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light film to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) or even a millimeter (1 mm) in areas of heavy accumulation. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several
            millimeters in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with high humidity),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination sources), spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from
            dissolved contaminants), and uniform coatings (in sheltered environments).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on factors such as airflow, surface orientation, and the
            presence of surface defects. Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to have the most uniform distribution.
        silicon germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. The color darkens due to oxidation
            of iron compounds and the accumulation of organic matter. The thickness increases over time, and the texture may
            become slightly crusty in areas with high humidity.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin film of individual particles. 2) Accumulation
            begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and then spreads inward. 3) Over time, the film thickens and becomes
            more continuous. 4) Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration.
            5) Point sources of contamination expand outward, creating localized areas of heavy buildup. Timeframe: Hours
            to days for initial film formation, weeks to months for significant thickening, and years for heavy encrustation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with a slight yellowish tint. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            Rust-Orange (#A0522D) to a darker Burnt Sienna (#8A3324) due to iron oxide content. Soot particles contribute
            to dark gray (#4A4A4A) or black (#000000) specks. Pollen adds a yellowish-green hue (#9ACD32) in some areas. Calcium
            Carbonate can create a chalky white (#F5F5F5) appearance.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in areas with surface imperfections, such as scratches or
            pits. It also collects along edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. On vertical
            surfaces, gravity can cause streaks and drip marks. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in corners due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal samples will generally have higher concentrations than the bottom
            surfaces. Crevices and pits act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations in these areas. Vertical
            walls will have a concentration gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and a very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy layer that partially obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more
            continuous layer that significantly obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            opaque layer that almost completely obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, heavily encrusted layer that completely obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Silicon Germanium typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a color range
            from light gray to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, with heavier accumulation in crevices and
            along edges. The texture is generally powdery and easily disturbed.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along the perimeter of the Silicon Germanium. 3) Point source spreading from localized contamination
            sources. 4) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas
            with uneven surface roughness. 6) Localized concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter of the Silicon Germanium acts as a collection point for airborne particles.
            While the center areas also accumulate dust, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges. This effect
            is more pronounced on larger surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and builds up
            in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points, leading to higher
            concentrations along the perimeter. Depressions and pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking
            is a common phenomenon. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs down the
            incline. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs precariously.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution and color variations. The presence of soot particles can create a slight
            darkening effect. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed unless there is a thin
            film of oil present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to talcum powder. It feels slightly
            abrasive to the touch due to the presence of silica and alumina particles. Under high magnification, individual
            particles appear as irregular shapes, with some crystalline structures (especially calcium carbonate) and fibrous
            organic matter (pollen). Soot particles are typically spherical and clustered.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm for light contamination to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm or more in extreme cases. In crevices, the thickness can exceed 500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in areas with high
            humidity and prolonged exposure. 3) Discrete patches and spots/dots scattered across the surface. 4) Drip marks
            and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 5) Buildups in crevices and corners. 6) Stains caused by the leaching of
            soluble components from the dust layer.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The uniformity level is influenced by factors such as airflow patterns, surface roughness,
            electrostatic charge, and the location of contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than
            vertical surfaces.
        silicon nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color may darken due to oxidation
            and the accumulation of organic matter. Thickness increases over time, potentially leading to visible buildup.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments,
            but more often it's point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in
            dust composition and concentration (months).
          color_variations: Fresh dust often exhibits a light tan color (#D2B48C) due to the presence of silicates and carbonates.
            As it ages and absorbs moisture, it can darken to a muted brown (#8B4513). Iron oxides contribute rust-orange
            hues (#A0522D), while soot particles create dark gray to black spots (#36454F). Pollen can introduce yellow or
            greenish tints (#E4D00A).
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily on horizontal surfaces due to gravitational settling. It
            also collects in crevices, corners, and along edges where airflow is reduced. Wind and rain can create streaks
            and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Point sources of contamination, such as nearby construction, can lead to
            localized concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and reduced airflow. Crevices
            and depressions act as collection points. Top surfaces exposed to the environment accumulate more dust than sheltered
            undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible film, 1-2 μm thick. Light (10-30%): thin, patchy layer,
            2-5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): visible coating, 5-20 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): substantial layer, 20-50 μm thick.
            Extreme (>85%): thick, obscuring layer, >50 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on silicon nitride typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a muted,
            earthy tone. The color is often a blend of light browns and grays, with localized variations depending on the
            specific composition of the dust. Coverage can range from a barely visible film to a substantial coating, influenced
            by environmental factors and surface orientation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns), point source spreading (radial pattern
            from a specific source), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven
            distribution due to surface irregularities), streaky/linear (caused by wind or water), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points, trapping particles carried by the air. The center areas may have
            lower concentrations due to higher airflow and less electrostatic attraction.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than angled surfaces due to gravitational settling. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and surface irregularities provide collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a thicker layer.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in depressions. Runs down slopes are common.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. The presence of metallic particles (e.g.,
            iron oxides) can create subtle sheen or sparkle in certain areas. No significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly abrasive to the touch. Under
            magnification, individual particles are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers in size. In
            humid environments, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty due to moisture absorption and the presence
            of organic matter.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm. In extreme
            cases, particularly in industrial environments, localized accumulations can reach thicknesses of up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial layer), thick crusts (aged accumulation), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (discoloration from absorbed contaminants),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in corners or crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due
            to water or wind).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in airflow, surface charge, and the distribution of contamination sources. The presence
            of surface defects or contaminants can also influence dust accumulation.
        silver:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more adhered, and potentially thicker. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays
            due to the accumulation of soot and organic matter. The texture can become crusty or even slightly cemented in
            areas with repeated moisture exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in relatively clean environments. Point
            sources expand outward, creating localized concentrations. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and deposition rates. Months of exposure lead to thicker, more adhered layers with darker
            coloration.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#C8C5B7). Slightly aged: Tan with hints of yellow (#D2B48C). Moderately
            aged: Light brown with reddish undertones (#A68B64). Heavily aged: Dusty brown with dark gray patches (#736357)
            due to soot accumulation. Areas with moisture exposure may exhibit darker, almost black (#211E1E) staining from
            organic matter.'
          common_patterns: Distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in recessed areas, along edges, and on horizontal
            surfaces. Streaking can occur on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation. Fingerprints or other contact
            points tend to attract and hold more dust, creating localized concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction
            and air flow patterns. Crevices and recessed areas accumulate more dust due to reduced air flow and physical trapping.
            Top surfaces exposed to the air typically have more dust than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and light dusting, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film, silver surface still clearly visible. Thickness: 5-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Noticeable layer, partially obscuring the silver surface. Thickness: 10-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant obscuration,
            silver surface barely visible. Thickness: 25-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): Near-complete coverage, silver surface almost
            entirely hidden. Thickness: >50 μm, potentially exceeding 100 μm in some areas.'
          description: Environmental dust on silver presents as a fine, often uneven layer with a dominant grayish-tan hue.
            The texture ranges from powdery to slightly adhered depending on humidity and composition. Coverage varies greatly,
            from sparse speckling to near-complete obscuration of the silver surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (in controlled environments with low air movement).
            2) Edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction and air currents). 3) Point source spreading (from a nearby
            source of dust). 4) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source). 5) Patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven surface conditions or localized contamination). 6) Streaky/linear (due to water runoff or wind).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            air flow patterns. The mechanism involves the concentration of electric fields at sharp edges, attracting charged
            dust particles. Air currents also tend to deposit dust along edges due to turbulence and stagnation points.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced air flow and physical trapping. Flat areas
            tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking due to gravity.
            Edges act as collection points due to electrostatic attraction and air currents. Depressions and pits fill with
            dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead surfaces tend to accumulate
            less dust, but particles can hang from them due to electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal sheen. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the unevenness of the dust distribution. Darker, soot-rich areas absorb more
            light, appearing dull, while lighter areas reflect more light, appearing slightly brighter. No significant iridescence
            is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust is powdery and easily disturbed. Over time, especially with humidity, it becomes
            more adhered and slightly sticky due to hygroscopic components like salts and organic matter. Close inspection
            reveals a fine granular texture, with occasional larger particles like pollen or insect fragments visible. Under
            high magnification, individual particles of SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ appear as irregular, angular shapes.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. A light dusting may be only 1-5 μm thick. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 10-50 μm. Heavy accumulation can reach 100-250 μm or even thicker in sheltered areas or crevices. Extreme
            cases can exceed 500 μm, resembling a thin coating of soil.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial stage of dust accumulation). 2) Discrete
            patches (localized areas of contamination). 3) Spots/dots (individual dust particles or small aggregates). 4)
            Stains (discoloration caused by dust reacting with the silver surface, especially in the presence of moisture).
            5) Uniform coatings (in relatively clean environments). 6) Buildups (thick accumulations in sheltered areas).
            7) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces due to water runoff).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare outside of controlled laboratory settings. The level of uniformity is primarily influenced
            by air currents, surface geometry, and the presence of localized contamination sources.
        slate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light gray, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and more difficult to remove. The color shifts towards darker
            grays and browns due to the accumulation of organic matter and chemical reactions with the slate surface. Thickness
            increases over time, especially in sheltered areas.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens gradually (days/weeks). Accumulation begins
            at contact points (edges, crevices) then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in sheltered areas.
            Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects are observed with seasonal variations (e.g., pollen deposition
            in spring). The timeframe for significant buildup (visible to the naked eye) is typically weeks to months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D3D3D3 (light gray) with subtle variations depending on local soil composition.
            Aged dust: #A9A9A9 (dark gray) to #808080 (gray) with possible tinges of #A0522D (sienna) from iron oxides or
            #6F4E37 (brown) from organic matter. In areas with high pollen concentration, a slight yellowish tint (#FAFAD2)
            may be present. Soot can darken the dust to #36454F (charcoal).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks from rainwater runoff. Sheltered areas tend to have a more uniform coating
            compared to exposed areas. Point sources of contamination (e.g., bird droppings, industrial emissions) create
            localized concentrations with radial or gradient patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas compared
            to vertical surfaces and exposed areas. Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. The
            top of a slate surface may have a different dust composition than the bottom due to gravitational settling and
            rainwater runoff. Corners and areas near point sources exhibit the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick, slight discoloration. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy coating, 5-10 μm thick, subtle texture change. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, 10-50 μm thick,
            visible texture. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring coating, 50-100 μm thick, significant texture. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, crusty buildup, >100 μm thick, obscuring underlying surface.'
          description: Environmental dust on slate typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            grayish-brown hue. Coverage varies significantly depending on exposure and surface orientation, ranging from a
            barely visible film to a noticeable accumulation in sheltered areas. The dust layer often highlights the natural
            texture of the slate.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in sheltered areas), edge accumulation
            (along roof tiles or paving stones), point source spreading (around vents or chimneys), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven exposure), streaky/linear (from rainwater runoff),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to reduced airflow and the
            barrier effect. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is because edges act as traps
            for airborne particles, while the center is more exposed to wind and rain.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas tend to pool dust particles. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as barriers, trapping
            dust particles. Contours influence the flow of rainwater, creating localized areas of higher or lower dust concentration.
            Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common phenomenon. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are observed. Dust does not hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The dust layer does not typically exhibit iridescence
            or rainbow effects unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch. At higher
            magnifications (100x+), individual particles of varying sizes (1-50 μm) are visible. The dust layer conforms to
            the underlying slate texture, accentuating any natural roughness or cleavage planes. In areas with moisture, the
            dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in exposed areas to a heavier buildup of 50-200
            μm in sheltered areas. In extreme cases, accumulation in crevices can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from rainwater),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from chemical
            reactions), uniform coatings (in sheltered areas), and buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is higher in sheltered areas with minimal exposure to wind and rain. Variations are caused by differences in surface
            orientation, exposure to the elements, and proximity to contamination sources.
        soapstone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more deeply embedded in the soapstone's porous surface, darker in color, and more difficult
            to remove. The thickness increases over time, and the texture may become more consolidated or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days
            and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Layering effects can be observed with seasonal variations in dust composition and
            deposition rates. Months of accumulation can lead to visible crusts and stains.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust: Darker, muted brown (#796957) with possible
            reddish-brown (Burnt Sienna, #E97451) or yellowish-brown (#C19A6B) tinges depending on iron oxide and organic
            content. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-green (#9ACD32) cast, especially
            during pollen seasons.'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with localized spots and streaks. Accumulation is
            most pronounced in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces where dust can settle. Drip marks may be
            visible on vertical surfaces, especially after rain or cleaning.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly across the surface. Edges and crevices tend to have
            heavier concentrations due to dust trapping. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces.
            Sheltered areas have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Top surfaces may have more dust than bottom surfaces
            due to settling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 5-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film, easily removable, 10-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, some texture, 25-50 μm thickness.
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, obscuring the surface, 50-100 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Very thick buildup, significant
            texture, >100 μm thickness.'
          description: Environmental dust on soapstone typically appears as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of muted browns and grays, often with reddish or yellowish undertones depending on the local soil
            composition. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (dust collects along edges and corners),
            point source spreading (dust radiates outward from a specific source), gradient from source (dust concentration
            decreases with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution with distinct patches), streaky/linear
            (dust forms streaks due to water runoff or air currents), and localized concentrations (dust accumulates in specific
            areas due to surface irregularities).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced
            airflow and trapping. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is due to the edges acting
            as barriers, preventing dust from being blown away.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and trapping. Flat areas allow dust to settle and accumulate. Vertical surfaces experience
            drip marks and runoff. Edges act as barriers, collecting dust. Depressions and indentations fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common. Pooling occurs
            at bottom edges where dust accumulates due to gravity and water runoff.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the texture and variations in color. Soot particles may exhibit a slight sheen under strong light.
            No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it can easily be smeared
            or brushed away. With heavier buildup, it can become slightly crusty, especially if exposed to moisture and subsequent
            drying. Close inspection may reveal individual dust particles and fibers.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 5-20 μm to a heavy buildup of 100-500 μm, or even
            up to 1 mm in sheltered areas with prolonged accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks caused by water runoff), runs/streaks
            (linear patterns caused by air currents), thin films (uniform coatings of dust), thick crusts (consolidated layers
            of dust), discrete patches (isolated areas of dust accumulation), spots/dots (small, individual dust particles),
            and stains (discoloration caused by embedded dust).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by air currents, surface geometry, and the location of dust sources. Sheltered areas tend to have
            higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        soda-lime glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, almost imperceptible film, often with
            a light tan color. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker (more brown or gray), thicker, and more consolidated.
            It may also exhibit signs of weathering, such as cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., edges) and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments.
            Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. Months to years
            will result in a visible, often uneven, layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E0D8B4 (light beige-tan). Aged dust (weeks): #A39781 (grayish-tan). Dust with high
            iron content: #B7410E (rust-orange). Dust with soot: #463E3A (dark grayish-brown). Dust with pollen: #F0E68C (khaki).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating (in sheltered environments), localized spots (from point
            sources), streaks (from water runoff), and drip marks (on vertical surfaces). Accumulation is often heavier at
            edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and reduced airflow.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravitational settling.
            Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas due to reduced wind erosion. Top surfaces of horizontal
            panes will have more dust than the underside.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as a very faint haze, almost invisible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): A slightly more noticeable film, with some visible patches. Thickness: 5-15 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A
            clearly visible layer, with distinct patches and streaks. Thickness: 15-40 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque
            layer, obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: 40-80 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer, completely
            obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: >80 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on soda-lime glass typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color
            range of light tan to brownish-gray. The distribution varies from a thin, almost invisible film to a more noticeable,
            patchy accumulation, often concentrated at edges and in crevices. The texture is generally powdery and easily
            disturbed.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: 1) Uniform coating (in controlled environments),
            2) Edge accumulation (due to electrostatic forces), 3) Point source spreading (from localized contamination sources),
            4) Streaky/linear (due to water runoff), 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and reduced
            airflow. The perimeter of the glass pane will often show a higher concentration of dust compared to the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It pools on flat areas due to gravitational settling. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects
            at edges due to electrostatic forces. It may bridge small gaps between surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to water runoff. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. The settling
            rate depends on particle size and density.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more visible and may exhibit a slight matte sheen.
            Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the dust layer is less noticeable and appears more subdued. There is no significant
            iridescence or rainbow effect unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and fine-grained, similar to talcum powder. It feels slightly
            abrasive to the touch, especially with heavier accumulations. At higher magnification (e.g., 50x optical microscope),
            individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. The surface is matte, not glossy.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 to 100 micrometers (μm). A thin film is typically 1-10 μm, while
            heavy buildup can reach 50-100 μm or more in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (on exposed surfaces), 2) Thick crusts (in sheltered
            areas), 3) Discrete patches (from localized contamination), 4) Spots/dots (from airborne particles), 5) Drip marks
            (on vertical surfaces), 6) Runs/streaks (from water runoff).'
          uniformity_assessment: The uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare in uncontrolled environments. Uniformity depends on airflow, surface orientation, and the
            presence of localized contamination sources.
        stainless steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time, the dust can become more
            compacted and adhere more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and reds due to oxidation
            of iron compounds. Thickness increases with continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, the film
            thickens and becomes more visible. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly. After weeks, the dust begins
            to compact and adhere more strongly. Seasonal variations in dust composition and weather patterns can lead to
            layering effects. Months of exposure result in a significant, potentially crusty layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #E0E0E0). Aged dust (days): Pale yellowish-brown (#CDB38B).
            Aged dust (weeks/months, with Fe₂O₃): Rust-tinged brown (#A07A55). Heavily soiled (organic content): Dark grayish-brown
            (#4A4A4A). Pollen-rich: Yellowish-green tint (#9ACD32, subtle).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform. Common patterns include streaks on vertical surfaces due to
            rain or condensation, localized spots around point sources of contamination, and heavier deposits in crevices
            and along edges. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas have the highest concentrations.
            Top surfaces of horizontal members accumulate more than undersides. Exposed areas generally have lower concentrations
            due to wind and rain.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A thin film, slightly obscuring the underlying stainless steel. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable
            layer, with some of the underlying surface still visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick layer, significantly
            obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, obscuring layer. Thickness:
            >100 μm, potentially reaching millimeters.'
          description: Environmental dust on stainless steel typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a
            dominant color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution varies from a thin, almost invisible film
            to localized accumulations, often influenced by surface geometry and airflow patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Uniform coating (on horizontal, sheltered surfaces),
            Edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and airflow), Point source spreading (radial patterns from vents
            or machinery), Streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation), Patchy/spotty (uneven deposition
            from air currents), Localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as barriers, trapping particles carried by the air. Center areas tend to have lower concentrations,
            especially on flat surfaces exposed to wind or rain.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices act
            as traps for dust particles. Flat areas allow for more uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces experience runoff,
            leading to streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust. Slopes experience runs of dust-laden water.
            Overhead surfaces can accumulate dust, but less readily than horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced and the color is more vibrant. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to wash out the color, making the dust appear grayer. The surface is generally matte,
            with minimal specular reflection. Oily components can introduce a slight sheen.
          texture_details: Feels powdery or slightly gritty to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), individual particles
            are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant
            gloss unless oily components are present. Aged dust can become slightly crusty due to moisture absorption and
            cementation.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light film to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. Extreme cases in industrial settings can reach millimeters
            (1-2 mm) in thickness.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (on most surfaces), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            Runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces), Discrete patches (randomly distributed), Spots/dots (from individual particles),
            Stains (from dissolved contaminants), Buildups (in corners and crevices), Thick crusts (in areas with repeated
            wetting and drying).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with
            minor variations is possible on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Moderately patchy is common on vertical surfaces.
            Highly variable/irregular is typical in areas with complex airflow or localized contamination sources. The level
            of uniformity is primarily determined by airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the source of the dust.
        stainless steel 304:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, light-colored film, often barely visible.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated. The color shifts towards deeper
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. The texture can become more crusty and difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye, within hours of exposure.
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more visible, especially at edges and in crevices. Over weeks and months,
            the dust layer consolidates and darkens due to oxidation and the accumulation of additional contaminants. Seasonal
            variations in dust concentration and precipitation influence the rate of buildup. Layering effects can occur due
            to alternating wet and dry periods.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust (weeks): Yellowish-brown (#967969
            to #A07A55). Dust with high iron content: Rust-orange (#B7410E to #A2503A). Dust with soot: Dark grayish-brown
            (#4A444D to #605851). Color varies significantly based on local soil composition.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates most readily on horizontal surfaces and in crevices. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            streaks due to gravity and rain. Edges and corners tend to collect more dust than flat, exposed areas. Wind direction
            and surface roughness significantly influence the distribution pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges, corners, and crevices tend to accumulate more dust than flat, exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal
            components accumulate more dust than undersides. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas. The
            concentration gradient decreases with increasing distance from dust sources.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, scattered dust particles. Thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, translucent film. Thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscuring the underlying metal
            finish. Thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque layer, significantly altering the surface appearance. Thickness
            100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup. Thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Stainless Steel 304 typically appears as a fine, matte layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The texture is generally powdery, and the distribution varies from
            uniform coatings to localized accumulations depending on surface orientation and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along welds and seams. 3) Point source spreading from vents or openings. 4) Streaky/linear patterns
            on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with uneven airflow.
            6) Gradient from source, decreasing concentration with distance.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to reduced airflow
            and electrostatic effects. The edges act as barriers, trapping airborne particles. Center areas tend to be cleaner
            due to greater exposure to wind and rain. This behavior is more pronounced on horizontal surfaces than vertical
            surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and indentations fill with dust over time. The dust layer tends to follow
            the contours of the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven water flow carrying dust particles.
            Settling on horizontal surfaces is primarily driven by gravity. Runs down slopes are influenced by both gravity
            and surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the lighter, grayish tones. The presence of oily residues within the dust can create
            a slight sheen. No iridescence is typically observed unless specific contaminants (e.g., certain metallic oxides)
            are present.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it disperses easily.
            With higher moisture content, it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Under magnification (100x), individual
            particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen, angular mineral fragments, fibrous organic matter) are visible.
            It feels slightly abrasive to the touch.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (barely visible film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered
            areas with minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more. Average thickness on exposed horizontal surfaces
            is typically 25-100 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on exposed surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in sheltered
            areas. 3) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4) Runs/streaks caused by water flow. 5) Discrete patches in areas
            with localized contamination. 6) Stains caused by dissolved contaminants. 7) Buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the presence
            of localized dust sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        stainless steel 316:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and harder to remove. Iron oxide components oxidize further,
            leading to a more pronounced reddish-brown hue. Thickness increases over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and spreads outward. Edges and crevices accumulate dust more rapidly. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Layering effects can be observed with seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates. Months of exposure lead to a thicker, more compacted layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan). Lightly aged: #A98D61 (sandy brown). Moderately aged: #8B4513 (saddle
            brown). Heavily aged (with iron oxide): #B7410E (rust-orange). Soot-rich areas: #36454F (charcoal gray).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation, and accumulation in crevices and corners. Edges and welds tend to collect more dust due
            to electrostatic attraction and surface roughness.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to the environment have higher
            concentrations than sheltered undersides. Crevices and welds act as dust traps.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, easily removed, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures the underlying metal, 20-50
            μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, difficult to remove, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick,
            crusty buildup, significantly alters the surface appearance, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on Stainless Steel 316 typically presents as a fine, matte layer, ranging from light
            tan to reddish-brown. Coverage varies greatly depending on exposure and surface orientation, often accumulating
            in crevices and along edges. The texture is generally powdery and easily disturbed.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (all surfaces), point source spreading (near vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces due to water runoff), localized
            concentrations (crevices, corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and increased surface roughness. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have slightly less dust accumulation,
            especially on vertical surfaces where gravity and runoff remove dust from the center more readily.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            attraction. Flat areas allow for even settling. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act
            as collection points. Contours influence airflow and dust deposition patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of
            dust particles. Runs down slopes are observed on inclined surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the lighter tan and gray tones. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and fine-grained, similar to silt. It feels slightly abrasive
            to the touch. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. In
            areas with high humidity, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for light dust to 50-200 μm for heavy buildup.
            In extreme cases, buildup in sheltered areas can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with moisture),
            discrete patches (where dust settles unevenly), spots/dots (individual particles adhering to the surface), stains
            (where dust mixes with moisture and adheres strongly), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (in
            sheltered areas), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by air currents, surface orientation, and the presence of crevices or other features that trap dust.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed layer with a powdery
            texture and a tan or light gray color. Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes darker, more compacted, and
            may exhibit slight staining or discoloration of the steel surface. The thickness increases, and the texture can
            become more crusty or adherent.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye, within hours of exposure.
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more noticeable, starting at contact points and edges. Over weeks, the
            dust spreads inward from the edges and accumulates in crevices. Over months, layering effects become apparent,
            with older layers becoming compacted and darker. Seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates
            can also influence the buildup pattern.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust: #A9A9A9 (dark gray), Dust with high iron content: #8B4513
            (brown), Dust with organic matter: #696969 (dim gray), Dust near industrial areas: #46362B (dark brown)'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in sheltered areas, crevices, and along edges. On vertical surfaces, it
            often forms streaks due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces exhibit a more uniform coating, although variations
            in thickness are common. Areas near sources of dust (e.g., roads, construction sites) will have higher concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier accumulation
            due to airflow patterns and electrostatic effects. Top surfaces of horizontal members accumulate more dust than
            undersides. Sheltered areas and crevices trap dust. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to
            gravity and runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, partially obscuring the steel surface, thickness 25-100
            μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring layer, significant color change, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very
            thick buildup, completely obscuring the steel, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on steel presents as a fine, particulate layer, typically light brown to grayish-tan,
            that obscures the underlying metallic sheen. The texture is generally powdery or slightly gritty, and the distribution
            varies from a thin, almost invisible film to a noticeable coating, depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along corners and seams, point source spreading from vents or machinery, gradient from source with decreasing
            concentration, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation runoff, and localized concentrations in areas with electrostatic charge.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to airflow patterns
            and electrostatic charge buildup. The edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by the wind. Center
            areas on flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner, layer of dust.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for pooling of dust. Vertical surfaces experience dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection
            points. Contours can influence airflow and create localized areas of higher or lower dust concentration. Depressions
            fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a direct result of gravity-driven runoff. Horizontal surfaces experience
            settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more
            prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. The dust does not typically exhibit iridescence or rainbow
            effects unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine and powdery (like talc) when freshly deposited to slightly gritty
            or crusty as it ages and absorbs moisture or reacts with the steel surface. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual
            particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible. It feels dry to the touch unless exposed to humidity, in which
            case it can become slightly sticky.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (barely visible film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme
            cases, such as in heavily polluted industrial environments, buildup can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on most surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            caused by water, pools/puddles in depressions, thick crusts in areas with repeated wetting and drying, discrete
            patches where dust adheres to surface imperfections, spots/dots from individual particles, and stains where dust
            reacts with the steel.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on factors like airflow, surface orientation, and proximity to dust sources.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        stoneware:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly bound to the surface, often requiring scrubbing to remove. Color deepens
            over time due to oxidation of iron compounds and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually,
            potentially leading to visible crust formation.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film on all exposed surfaces. It then thickens gradually, with faster
            accumulation at edges and in crevices. Accumulation begins at contact points with the air and spreads outward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns.
            Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates. This process can
            take hours for a barely visible film, days for a light coating, and months for a heavy buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#D2B48C) with a slight gray undertone. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted
            reddish-brown (#A0785A) to a darker, rust-orange (#B7410E) due to iron oxide accumulation. Soot presence can shift
            the color towards grayish-brown (#848482). Pollen can add a yellowish tint (#FAFAD2) in certain seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks and
            drip marks from rainwater or condensation washing away some of the dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than the center areas of flat surfaces. Crevices and depressions act as
            collection points, leading to significantly higher concentrations. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed
            areas. Top surfaces of horizontal features collect more dust than the undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 10 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy film, slightly alters surface color, thickness 10-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures
            some surface details, thickness 25-75 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring most surface details, thickness 75-150
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, completely obscures surface, thickness >150 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on stoneware presents as a fine, matte layer, typically ranging from light tan to
            reddish-brown. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating subtle color variations and
            textural differences compared to the clean stoneware surface. Coverage can range from sparse to nearly complete,
            depending on exposure and cleaning frequency.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along raised features, point source spreading from nearby sources, gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces
            due to water runoff, and localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The mechanism is that edges disrupt airflow, causing dust particles to deposit more readily. Additionally,
            edges can have a slightly higher surface charge, attracting dust particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns. It builds up in crevices and depressions,
            acting as collection points. It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. It drips on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity and water runoff. It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow. It follows
            contours, creating subtle variations in thickness. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a uniform layer. Runs occur down slopes due to water runoff.
            Dust does not typically hang from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly lighter and more reddish-brown. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the grayish undertones. The surface remains matte under all lighting conditions,
            with no significant sheen or gloss. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly deposited, it feels slightly gritty.
            Heavier accumulations can form a thin, crusty layer that is easily disturbed. Under magnification (10x), individual
            dust particles are visible, exhibiting irregular shapes and sizes. The surface is matte, lacking any significant
            gloss.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            from water runoff, pools/puddles in depressions, thick crusts in sheltered areas with minimal cleaning, discrete
            patches in areas with localized contamination sources, stains from organic matter, and uniform coatings on horizontal
            surfaces. No crystalline structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Horizontal surfaces tend to have mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations in thickness. Vertical surfaces are moderately patchy due to water runoff. Edges and crevices
            exhibit highly variable/irregular distribution with concentrated buildup. The uniformity level is primarily influenced
            by airflow, surface orientation, and cleaning frequency.
        stucco:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable layer. Over time, the dust becomes more
            embedded in the stucco's texture, harder to remove, and may undergo chemical changes due to UV exposure and moisture.
            Color darkens and can become more reddish-brown due to iron oxidation. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges. Over time, the
            film thickens and spreads, gradually covering more of the surface. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects occur due to seasonal variations in dust deposition. This process can take days to
            months for noticeable changes and years for significant buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to light tan (#E9C2A6). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted brownish-gray
            (#848482) to a reddish-brown (#A0785A) due to iron oxide accumulation, and sometimes a greenish-gray (#A7B19B)
            where algae or mold are present. Soot deposits can create dark gray to black (#000000-#434A54) areas.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from direct rain. Vertical
            surfaces often exhibit streaks and drip marks, while horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform coating.
            Areas near sources of pollution (e.g., roads, industrial sites) will exhibit higher concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices where dust particles are
            trapped. Top surfaces of horizontal features tend to accumulate more dust than undersides. Vertical walls have
            a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity and rain washing. Exposed areas are generally lighter than sheltered
            areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            dulling of the surface, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct color change, visible dust layer, 20-50 μm
            thick. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, thick dust layer, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Surface almost
            completely obscured, very thick dust layer, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on stucco presents as a generally matte, dulling layer, shifting the stucco's original
            color towards muted browns, grays, and tans. The texture is typically powdery or slightly gritty, and the distribution
            is often uneven, influenced by wind, rain, and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (along window frames and trim), point source spreading (from vents or chimneys), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance from a road), patchy/spotty (due to uneven moisture exposure),
            streaky/linear (due to rain runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to the
            edges acting as barriers to airflow, trapping dust particles. The center areas of flat surfaces are more exposed
            to wind and rain, which tend to remove dust.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and water runoff. Flat areas
            tend to collect dust more readily than angled surfaces. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions
            and pores in the stucco surface provide anchoring points for dust accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles and water, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Vertical streaking
            is a common manifestation of gravity-driven water runoff carrying dust.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and dull, reducing the stucco's reflectivity.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the uneven distribution and subtle color variations. There is generally
            no sheen or gloss unless the dust layer is mixed with oily substances.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and fine-grained, with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 50 micrometers.
            It can feel slightly gritty to the touch, especially with higher concentrations of silica. In areas with moisture,
            it can become slightly sticky or crusty. Close inspection may reveal individual dust particles and aggregated
            clumps.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 micrometers in lightly contaminated areas to
            a buildup of 50-200 micrometers in heavily contaminated areas. In extreme cases, sheltered areas can accumulate
            up to 1 millimeter of dust over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with moisture), discrete patches (due to localized
            sources), stains (from organic matter), uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low due to variations in wind exposure, rain washing, surface texture, and proximity to dust sources. Sheltered
            areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        tantalum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, more consolidated, and potentially harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker
            browns and reds due to oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases with time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and becomes
            more noticeable. Over weeks, it begins to accumulate at edges and in crevices. Over months, the dust consolidates,
            darkens, and can form thicker, crustier deposits. Seasonal variations in pollen and particulate matter can lead
            to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E9DAC6), Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D, Sienna), Soot-rich dust:
            Dark gray (#4A4A4A), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#F0E68C), Iron-rich dust: Rust-orange (#B7410E).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction and airflow
            patterns. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks
            from water runoff carrying dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and sheltered areas exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical
            walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity and water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy layer, color
            of the tantalum is still easily visible. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, tantalum color partially obscured,
            thickness ~10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, tantalum color largely obscured, thickness ~50-250 μm.
            Extreme (>85%): Very thick, consolidated layer, tantalum color completely obscured, thickness >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on tantalum typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly, often concentrating
            in crevices and along edges, creating a mottled appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation,
            point source spreading from vents or openings, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff,
            patchy/spotty distribution in areas with variable airflow, and localized concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but often thinner, layer. This
            is because edges act as initial collection points for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection
            points. Depressions and pits trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling. Sloped surfaces exhibit runs. Overhead surfaces may accumulate
            dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it easily disperses.
            With heavier accumulation, it can become slightly crusty, especially if exposed to moisture. Tactile feel ranges
            from slightly gritty to smooth depending on particle size and composition.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            from water erosion, pools/puddles in depressions, discrete patches in areas with localized contamination sources,
            and buildups in corners and crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. On horizontal surfaces shielded from direct airflow, distribution
            can be mostly uniform with minor variations. On vertical or complex surfaces, distribution is typically moderately
            patchy to highly variable/irregular due to gravity, airflow, and surface geometry.
        teak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable layer. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more deeply embedded in the wood grain, darker in color, and more difficult to remove.
            The dust can also react with moisture and organic compounds in the wood, leading to staining and discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days and weeks. It begins at contact
            points (edges, grain) and spreads inward. There is uniform gradual accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Layering
            effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition (e.g., pollen in spring). Significant buildup (visible
            to the naked eye) typically occurs within days to weeks, depending on environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90). Aged dust: Darker, muted brown (#796959) with possible
            reddish-brown (rust-colored) tinges from iron oxides (#B7410E). Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray to almost black (#36454F).
            Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-brown (#C19A6B).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates along the grain of the teak, in corners, and around edges. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to collect more dust than vertical surfaces due to settling. Streaking can occur on vertical surfaces
            due to rain or condensation washing away some of the dust, leaving behind a residue.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust due to electrostatic effects and airflow patterns. Crevices and grain
            lines act as traps for dust particles. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered
            undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            dusting, slightly alters color, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Clearly visible layer, obscures original color,
            20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly alters color, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very
            thick buildup, completely obscures original color, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on teak presents as a fine particulate layer, typically exhibiting a muted, earthy
            tone. The dust tends to accumulate in the grain and crevices of the wood, creating a slightly textured surface
            with variable coverage depending on exposure and cleaning frequency. The dominant colors are usually shades of
            brown and gray, influenced by local soil composition and air pollution.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or cleaning), streaky/linear (due to rain or
            condensation). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in the grain. This is due
            to electrostatic effects, airflow patterns, and the physical trapping of particles by the edges and grain. The
            center areas of flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust due to settling. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles. Depressions
            and grain lines fill with dust, creating a textured surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust due to settling. Runs down slopes are common, creating
            streaky patterns. Dust hangs from overhead surfaces in minimal amounts due to electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the variations in color and texture. The presence of soot or metallic particles can create
            subtle variations in reflectivity, but generally, the surface remains non-reflective.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. Over time, especially with
            moisture, it can become more compacted and slightly sticky. Close inspection reveals fine particles clinging to
            the wood grain, creating a subtle roughness. The texture varies from smooth, thin films to slightly crusty accumulations
            in sheltered areas.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 micrometers (μm) for freshly deposited dust to
            a buildup of 50-200 μm or more in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure. Extreme buildup in crevices can reach
            up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas
            with moisture), discrete patches (due to uneven cleaning), spots/dots (from individual dust particles), stains
            (from chemical reactions), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare due to variations in airflow, surface texture, and cleaning practices. Sheltered areas and crevices tend
            to accumulate more dust, leading to non-uniform distribution.
        tempered glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a very thin, almost imperceptible film, often only
            visible under oblique lighting. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more firmly adhered
            to the surface. It may also develop a crusty or mottled appearance due to repeated wetting and drying cycles.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often only visible under oblique lighting (hours). It then thickens
            gradually, with dust particles adhering to the initial layer (days). Buildup often begins at contact points (e.g.,
            edges, corners) and spreads inward (weeks). Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with slight tan undertones. Aged dust (dry): Medium gray-brown
            (#848482) with reddish-brown (rust) tinges near metallic components (if present). Aged dust (moist): Darker, muddy
            brown (#604A3F). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-gray (#C0C090). Soot-heavy dust: Dark gray to black (#404040).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coatings on horizontal surfaces, streaks on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation runoff, and accumulation along edges and in corners. Point source spreading is also common
            near vents or other sources of dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity and
            water runoff. Edges and corners also tend to accumulate more dust due to electrostatic effects and reduced airflow.
            Sheltered areas (e.g., under overhangs) will have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Horizontal surfaces
            collect more dust than vertical.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, slight haze. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): Visible
            as a faint film, reduces transparency slightly. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Clearly visible, reduces
            transparency noticeably. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque in some areas, significantly reduces transparency.
            Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost completely opaque, thick crusts may form. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on tempered glass typically appears as a light to medium gray-brown film, often
            with variations in color and texture depending on the local environment and age of the deposit. It tends to accumulate
            more heavily in areas sheltered from wind and rain, creating visible patterns and gradients.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (common due to electrostatic attraction and wind patterns), point source spreading (radial pattern
            from a specific source), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven
            deposition), streaky/linear (due to water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            wind patterns that create eddies near edges. The center areas tend to be cleaner, especially on vertical surfaces
            where gravity and water runoff remove dust. Horizontal surfaces may exhibit more uniform distribution, but edges
            still tend to have higher concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection
            points. Depressions fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust particles.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer can appear slightly reflective, especially if it contains
            metallic particles. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to make the dust appear more matte and less vibrant. A thin
            layer may exhibit a slight haze or reduced transparency. Soot-heavy dust absorbs light, making the glass appear
            darker.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly abrasive. Over time, especially with moisture, it
            can become sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a fine-grained texture, sometimes with visible individual
            particles (especially pollen). Can feel smooth if very thin, rough if thick.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, light coating to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) or even a millimeter (1 mm) for heavy, aged buildup in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water),
            thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete
            patches (due to localized contamination), spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from dissolved contaminants).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the airflow patterns, surface orientation, and the presence
            of localized dust sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        terbium:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Light, easily removable, uniform in color. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Darker, more consolidated, potentially exhibiting staining or etching of the Terbium surface,
            thicker buildup, and harder to remove. Color shifts towards darker browns and grays due to organic matter decomposition
            and increased soot content.'
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film then thickens over time. It often begins at contact points (e.g.,
            edges, corners) then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point sources
            that expand outward. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration.
            Timeframes: Hours - initial thin film, Days - noticeable coating, Months - significant buildup, Years - thick,
            consolidated layer.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-brown (#A29B90), Aged dust: Medium brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513),
            Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F), Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-brown (#C2B280), Iron oxide staining:
            Rust-orange (#B7410E).'
          common_patterns: Non-uniform coating with preferential accumulation in low-lying areas and crevices. Streaking patterns
            are common on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture. Edges and corners tend to have higher concentrations.
            Flat horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces. Edges
            and corners tend to have higher concentrations due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. Crevices
            and low-lying areas accumulate more dust. Top surfaces exposed to direct airflow may have lower concentrations
            than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily visible
            layer, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick buildup, potentially obscuring the Terbium surface, thickness
            > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Terbium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant grayish-brown
            hue. The coverage varies significantly depending on the environment, ranging from a barely visible film to a noticeable
            coating, often accumulating in crevices and along edges. The texture is generally powdery and easily disturbed.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (very common),
            point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            and radial patterns (around small particles acting as nucleation sites).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. The perimeter often has a higher concentration than the center. This effect is more pronounced
            on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at edges, and follows contours.
            Sharp edges tend to accumulate more dust than rounded edges.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom,
            and vertical streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. The settling velocity of dust particles is typically
            in the range of 0.01-0.1 m/s, depending on particle size and density.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the grayish tones. The presence of iron oxides can create subtle reddish reflections.
            Soot particles absorb light, creating dark spots.
          texture_details: Powdery and fine-grained to the touch. Under magnification (100x), individual particles of SiO₂
            appear as angular, translucent grains. Al₂O₃ particles are typically smaller and more rounded. Soot particles
            are black and amorphous. The overall texture can become slightly sticky or crusty if exposed to moisture.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (barely visible film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In extreme cases, buildup
            can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stage), thick crusts (aged, moisture-affected),
            discrete patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (chemical reactions), uniform
            coatings (rare), buildups (in sheltered areas), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and runs/streaks (due to gravity
            and moisture).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and
            the presence of moisture. Smooth surfaces tend to have more uniform distribution than rough surfaces.
        terracotta:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): A light, barely perceptible film that slightly dulls the terracotta''s
            original color. Aged contamination (months/years): A more noticeable, darker layer that can significantly alter
            the terracotta''s appearance. The texture becomes more consolidated and potentially crusty, and the color deepens
            due to chemical reactions and the incorporation of organic matter.'
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin, almost invisible film that gradually
            thickens over time. Initially, dust particles adhere to contact points and edges, then spread inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources, such as bird droppings, expand outward. Layering
            effects can be observed as new dust deposits on top of older layers. Seasonal variations in dust deposition are
            common, with higher accumulation rates during dry and windy periods. Timeframes: Hours: Initial adhesion of particles.
            Days: Formation of a thin film. Months: Noticeable thickening and color change. Years: Formation of a thick, crusty
            layer.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E9DABB), Aged dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D), Soot-rich dust: Dark grayish-brown
            (#4A4444), Iron-rich dust: Burnt Sienna (#E97451), Calcium-rich dust: Off-white (#F8F8FF) with a slight grayish
            tint.'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in crevices, corners, and along edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are often observed due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal
            surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer of dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly depending on location. Edges and corners tend to have
            heavier concentrations due to airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal elements accumulate more dust than
            undersides. Crevices and depressions act as traps for dust particles. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top
            to bottom due to gravity and rainwater runoff. Exposed areas generally accumulate more dust than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely perceptible dusting, slight dulling of the terracotta color, thickness
            < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, visible film that slightly alters the terracotta color, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A noticeable layer that significantly changes the terracotta color, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            A thick, opaque layer that obscures the original terracotta color, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, crusty layer that completely hides the terracotta surface, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on terracotta presents as a fine, matte layer that subtly alters the original color.
            The dust layer typically exhibits a range of earthy tones, from light tan to reddish-brown, and tends to accumulate
            in recessed areas and along edges, creating a slightly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along borders and corners, point source spreading from localized sources of contamination (e.g., bird droppings),
            gradient from source (e.g., heavier near a road), patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven exposure, streaky/linear
            patterns from rainwater runoff, and localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to airflow
            patterns and electrostatic attraction. The edges act as barriers, causing dust particles to deposit along their
            perimeter. Center areas tend to have a more uniform, but often lighter, distribution. This is due to the edges
            disrupting airflow and creating areas of lower pressure where dust particles are more likely to settle.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects dust distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along their perimeter.
            Depressions and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in dust distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common
            due to rainwater runoff. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Dust can hang from overhead surfaces in sheltered areas, but this is less common on terracotta.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more pronounced, highlighting the texture and color
            variations. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the dust layer less noticeable.
            The dust layer is generally matte, with minimal sheen or gloss. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from a fine, powdery feel when lightly deposited to a slightly gritty or crusty
            feel with heavier accumulation. At a microscopic level, individual particles of dust are visible, creating a slightly
            rough surface. The dust layer is generally matte, lacking significant gloss or sheen.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly dusted areas to a heavier buildup
            of 50-200 μm in areas of significant accumulation. In extreme cases, crusts exceeding 1 mm can form.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks from rainwater, thin
            films on exposed surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, discrete patches from localized sources, spots/dots
            from individual particles, stains from organic matter, uniform coatings on horizontal surfaces, and buildups in
            corners and crevices. Crystalline structures are not typically observed unless specific salts are present in the
            dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due
            to variations in airflow, surface geometry, and exposure to environmental factors. The level of uniformity is
            influenced by the surrounding environment and the duration of exposure.
        thermoplastic elastomer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more compacted and adhered, often darkening in color due to chemical reactions and the incorporation of
            oils and moisture. The thickness increases, and the texture becomes less powdery and more crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in controlled environments. Point
            sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration.
            Significant buildup can occur within weeks in heavily polluted environments, while it may take months or years
            in cleaner environments.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E9DBC7), Aged dust: Grayish-brown (#808069), Soot-rich dust: Dark gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich dust: Reddish-brown (#A0522D), Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan (#FAF0E6).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Common patterns
            include a general coating with heavier buildup in sheltered areas, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and localized
            concentrations around point sources of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit the highest
            concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment are often more heavily contaminated than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            but thin layer, color change subtle, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, color change evident, 20-50
            μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily disturbed layer, significant color change, 50-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, crusty layer, obscuring original surface, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) typically presents as a matte, slightly textured
            layer with a dominant color range from light tan to grayish-brown. Coverage varies significantly depending on
            exposure and surface geometry, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            2) Edge accumulation (very common due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns), 3) Point source spreading
            (radial pattern from a specific source), 4) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), 5)
            Patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to surface irregularities), 6) Streaky/linear (due to wind or water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The perimeter of the TPE part often shows a higher concentration of dust compared to the center
            areas. This is especially pronounced in parts with sharp edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as collection points.
            The dust layer tends to follow the contours of the TPE surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit
            runs down the surface. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. Soot-rich areas may appear slightly darker
            and less reflective. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and slightly gritty to a more adhered, almost clay-like consistency
            depending on humidity and compaction. It feels dry to the touch unless moisture is present, in which case it can
            become slightly sticky. Close inspection reveals a fine particulate structure, sometimes with visible pollen grains
            or soot aggregates.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup (100-500
            μm or more) in areas with prolonged exposure and accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial contamination), 2) Thick crusts (aged contamination
            in high-exposure areas), 3) Discrete patches (localized contamination), 4) Spots/dots (individual particles or
            small aggregates), 5) Drip marks (vertical surfaces), 6) Buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface charge, airflow patterns, surface geometry,
            and the location of contamination sources.
        tile:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more compacted, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic matter decomposition),
            and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases over time, and the dust may become slightly cemented or crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at edges and corners (hours/days). The film
            gradually thickens and spreads across the surface (days/weeks). Over time, the dust becomes more compacted and
            may darken in color (weeks/months). Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates (months/years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #E0D8B4 (light beige-tan). Aged dust (indoors): #A6937C (grayish-brown). Aged dust
            (outdoors, iron-rich soil): #B7410E (rust-orange). Soot-heavy dust: #463E3A (dark grayish-brown). Pollen-rich
            dust: #F0E68C (khaki).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation along edges and in corners is very common. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to have a
            more uniform coating. Vertical surfaces show streaks and drip marks, especially after rain or condensation. Crevices
            and grout lines exhibit the heaviest accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in corners. Top surfaces of horizontal
            tiles tend to have higher concentrations than vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed
            areas. Crevices and grout lines exhibit the highest concentrations. Concentration decreases with increasing distance
            from dust sources (e.g., vents, windows).
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy film, easily disturbed, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures the original surface
            texture slightly, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significantly alters the surface appearance,
            100-250 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, almost completely obscures the original surface,
            250-500 μm+ thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on tile typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            tan to reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age. The dust tends to accumulate in corners, along edges,
            and in any surface imperfections, creating a subtly textured appearance.
          distribution_patterns: Edge accumulation is highly prevalent. Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces is common.
            Streaky/linear patterns are observed on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff. Patchy/spotty distribution
            occurs in areas with uneven airflow or localized sources of contamination. Point source spreading can be seen
            around vents or openings.
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. The edges act as barriers, trapping particles. The center areas tend to have a more uniform, but often
            lighter, coating.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for uniform settling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers,
            trapping dust particles. Depressions and imperfections fill with dust.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settled dust. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead
            surfaces may have dust hanging in loose clumps or layers.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly brighter and more reflective, but remains
            matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the gray tones. There is no significant sheen or gloss unless
            the dust is mixed with oily substances. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles
            of varying sizes are visible. The surface is generally matte, with a slight roughness due to the particulate nature
            of the dust. No crystalline structure is typically visible without higher magnification.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup in sheltered areas). Average thickness
            on exposed surfaces is 25-100 μm.
          typical_formations: Thin films are the most common formation. Drip marks and runs/streaks are prevalent on vertical
            surfaces. Discrete patches and spots/dots occur in areas with localized contamination. Thick crusts can form in
            areas with prolonged exposure and moisture. Stains may develop if the dust contains staining agents (e.g., iron
            oxides).
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is generally moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due to
            variations in airflow, surface texture, and contamination sources. Uniformity is higher on smooth, horizontal
            surfaces in enclosed environments. Highly variable distribution is common outdoors.
        tin:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a very light, almost imperceptible film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes darker, thicker, and more consolidated. The color shifts towards darker browns and
            grays. The texture becomes more crusty and harder to remove. Over very long periods (years), the dust can become
            partially cemented to the tin surface.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens gradually
            over time, becoming more visible. The accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and then
            spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point sources of contamination
            expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration. Significant buildup can occur within days in heavily polluted environments, while it may take
            months or years in cleaner environments.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Medium brownish-gray (#848482
            to #796959). Areas with higher iron oxide content: Rust-tinged brown (#A0785A). Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to
            almost black (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas (seasonal): Yellowish-tan (#FAF0BE).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in recessed areas, along edges, and in corners due to airflow
            patterns and electrostatic attraction. On vertical surfaces, slight streaking may be visible due to gravity. Horizontal
            surfaces accumulate a more uniform layer. Point sources of contamination (e.g., nearby construction) can create
            radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and recessed areas act as traps for dust particles.
            Top surfaces exposed to the air accumulate more dust than sheltered bottom surfaces. Areas near potential dust
            sources (e.g., construction sites) will have higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A very light, almost invisible film. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            A barely noticeable dusting. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A visible layer of dust, obscuring the original
            surface slightly. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily disturbed layer of dust, significantly altering
            the surface appearance. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, consolidated layer of dust, completely
            obscuring the original surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on tin typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light grayish-tan
            to darker brownish-gray, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate unevenly,
            often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a slightly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and airflow), point source spreading (from localized contamination
            sources), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to
            uneven surface conditions), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer of dust. This behavior is more pronounced on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices, acting as dust traps. It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. It drips on vertical
            surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a visible line. It follows contours, conforming to the
            shape of the surface. It bridges gaps, forming dust webs.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust
            settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in dust thickness.
            Dust rarely hangs from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the uneven distribution and texture. The color appears slightly washed out under fluorescent
            light compared to natural light. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. When lightly disturbed, it easily smears or
            lifts off. Heavier accumulations can feel slightly gritty. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles
            of varying shapes and sizes are visible. In humid conditions, the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 1-10 μm for a light coating to 50-200 μm for a heavy buildup. In
            extreme cases, accumulations in crevices can reach up to 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages of contamination), thick crusts (aged,
            heavy contamination), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles adhering
            to the surface), stains (where moisture has dissolved some of the dust components), uniform coatings (on sheltered
            horizontal surfaces), buildups (in crevices and corners), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of crevices or other surface features. Sheltered horizontal surfaces tend to have the most uniform distribution.
        titanium:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Lightly colored, easily removed, thin film. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Darker, more adhered, thicker buildup. Color shifts towards darker browns and reds due to oxidation
            of iron compounds. Can become cemented and harder to remove due to chemical reactions with the titanium surface
            or atmospheric moisture.'
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). Begins at contact points
            (e.g., edges, crevices) then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered surfaces. Point
            sources expand outward in a radial pattern. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates (months/years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Tan (#E0DAC0), Aged dust: Reddish-Brown (#A0785A), Soot-rich dust: Dark Gray
            (#4A4A4A), Iron-rich dust: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E), Calcium-rich dust: Off-White (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from wind or rain.
            On vertical surfaces, it often forms streaks due to gravity. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer. Point sources (e.g., exhaust vents) create radial or gradient patterns.
          concentration_variations: Edges and crevices tend to have the highest concentrations. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Corners and sheltered areas have heavier deposits. Vertical walls
            have a concentration gradient, with more dust accumulating near the bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, individual dust particles scattered across the surface,
            thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A faint haze, slightly alters the color of the titanium, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscures the original surface texture, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            opaque layer, significantly alters the color and texture, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, encrusted
            layer, completely obscures the original surface, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on titanium typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan to
            reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. It tends to accumulate in crevices and along
            edges, often forming streaks or localized patches. The texture is generally powdery or slightly gritty.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to electrostatic forces and airflow patterns),
            Point source spreading (radial pattern from a source), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            Patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), Streaky/linear (due to rain or wind), Localized concentrations (in crevices
            or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic forces and airflow patterns. The
            edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform,
            but thinner, layer of dust.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners (due to airflow patterns), Builds up in crevices (sheltered from wind),
            Pools on flat areas (settling of dust), Drips on vertical surfaces (gravity), Collects at edges (electrostatic
            forces and airflow), Follows contours (conformal coating), Bridges gaps (dust particles adhering to each other),
            Fills depressions (settling of dust).
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges of vertical surfaces and in depressions on horizontal surfaces. Settling on horizontal
            surfaces creates a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, creating streaks. Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal
            due to the relatively low adhesion of dry dust.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant and the texture is more pronounced.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance and reduce color saturation. The dust layer is generally
            matte, so there is minimal specular reflection. Oily components can introduce a slight sheen.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles
            are visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers in size. The surface is generally matte, with
            no inherent gloss unless oily components are present. Can become crusty if exposed to moisture and then dried.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup in sheltered areas. Extreme cases in industrial settings can reach 1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (due to rain or condensation), Thin films (on
            exposed surfaces), Thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), Discrete patches (due to localized
            sources), Spots/dots (individual dust particles), Stains (where dust has reacted with the surface), Uniform coatings
            (on relatively flat, sheltered surfaces), Buildups (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in airflow, surface geometry, and dust source locations. Flat, exposed surfaces might have a relatively uniform
            layer, but edges and crevices will always have higher concentrations.
        titanium alloy (ti-6al-4v):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust can become more compacted and adhered to the surface, especially in humid environments. Color darkens due
            to oxidation and the incorporation of more organic material. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on sheltered horizontal surfaces. Point
            sources expand outward over time. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and
            deposition rates. Months of exposure lead to a thicker, more compacted layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow. Aged dust (weeks): Light reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) due to iron oxide oxidation. Heavily soiled (months): Darker brown (#8B4513) with possible black soot
            inclusions (#000000). Dust with high calcium carbonate: Off-white to light gray (#F5F5DC). Pollen-rich dust: Yellowish-tan
            (#EEE8AA).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and in areas sheltered from direct wind or
            rain. On vertical surfaces, it often forms streaks due to gravity and water runoff. Flat, horizontal surfaces
            tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Point source contamination (e.g., from a nearby chimney) will create
            a gradient pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier along edges and in crevices due to airflow patterns
            and particle trapping. Top surfaces of horizontal components tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces.
            Corners and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter)
            to bottom (heavier) due to gravity and water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Patchy,
            light tan appearance, 5-10 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable tan to light brown layer, 10-25 μm thick. Heavy
            (60-85%): Darker brown, visibly thick layer, 25-50 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, potentially
            obscuring the underlying titanium surface, 50-100+ μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on Ti-6Al-4V typically presents as a fine, matte layer ranging from light tan to
            reddish-brown, depending on the composition and age of the dust. It tends to accumulate in crevices and along
            edges, often exhibiting a slightly rough texture. Coverage varies significantly based on exposure and environmental
            conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along boundaries, point source spreading from localized sources, gradient from source towards less contaminated
            areas, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to water
            runoff, and localized concentrations in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and particle
            trapping. The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have lower concentrations unless they are sheltered or have
            a rough surface texture. The perimeter of a component often shows a higher concentration than the central area.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and particle trapping. Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Vertical surfaces
            exhibit drip marks and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along their length. Depressions
            and indentations act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, pooling
            at bottom edges, and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's
            influence. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs of dust and water mixtures.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can make the dust appear slightly brighter and more uniform in color. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Feels slightly gritty or powdery to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x), the texture appears
            as a collection of fine, irregularly shaped particles. Depending on humidity, it can become slightly sticky or
            crusty. No distinct crystalline structure is typically visible without high magnification (SEM).
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a thicker layer of
            25-100 μm in heavily soiled areas. In extreme cases, buildup in crevices can reach up to 500 μm (0.5 mm).
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks
            due to water flow, pools/puddles in depressions, thick crusts in areas with repeated wetting and drying, discrete
            patches where dust has settled, and stains where liquids have evaporated leaving behind residue.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. On horizontal surfaces sheltered from wind, the distribution
            can be mostly uniform with minor variations. On vertical or exposed surfaces, the distribution is typically moderately
            patchy to highly variable/irregular due to wind, rain, and gravity. Crevices and edges always show higher concentrations.
        titanium carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust can become more compacted and adhered to the surface, especially with moisture exposure. Color shifts towards
            darker browns and reds as iron oxides oxidize. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days to weeks). Begins at contact points
            (surface imperfections) then spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Layering
            effects can occur due to intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration
            can influence the buildup rate.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with subtle beige undertones (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Tan
            (#D2B48C) with hints of rust-orange (#A0522D) due to iron oxide oxidation. Heavily contaminated: Burnt Sienna
            (#E97451) to reddish-brown (#8B4513) with darker gray patches from soot.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform, with preferential deposition in crevices, along edges, and on
            horizontal surfaces. Streaking can occur on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture. Point source contamination
            (e.g., from a nearby vent) will result in a radial distribution pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Top surfaces
            exposed to the environment tend to have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides. Corners and areas near
            potential contamination sources (vents, machinery) exhibit the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible to the naked eye, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy layer, slightly alters surface color, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer,
            obscures original surface texture, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, surface color largely
            obscured, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, completely obscures original surface, thickness
            >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Titanium Carbide typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a dominant
            color range of light grays to reddish-browns, depending on the iron oxide content. The texture is generally powdery
            and matte, with coverage varying from sparse speckling to a more uniform coating depending on exposure and surface
            orientation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (common due to electrostatic effects and air currents), point source spreading (radial pattern),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface roughness
            or localized contamination), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and air currents. The edges
            act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas tend to have lower concentrations unless there is
            a direct source of contamination in the center.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas allow for pooling of dust, especially with moisture. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking.
            Edges act as collection points due to electrostatic effects. Depressions and surface imperfections trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a more uniform layer. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and
            in low-lying areas. Runs down slopes are common, creating visible streaks.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the powdery texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Powdery and fine-grained to the touch. Under magnification (50x-100x), individual particles are
            visible, ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. May exhibit slight clumping or agglomeration, especially
            in humid conditions. Can feel slightly abrasive if rubbed.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-300 μm) for heavy buildup. Extreme cases can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged, compacted
            dust), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual particle deposition), stains (due to
            moisture and dissolved contaminants), buildups (in corners and crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is rarely achieved in real-world conditions. Variations
            are caused by air currents, surface roughness, electrostatic charges, and localized sources of contamination.
            Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations than exposed areas.
        titanium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, loosely adhered layer with lighter colors.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes more compacted, thicker, and darker due to the accumulation of organic
            matter and chemical reactions with the environment. The aged layer may exhibit signs of weathering, such as cracking
            or flaking.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup typically starts as a thin film of individual particles or small clusters. Over
            time, these particles coalesce and form a more continuous layer. Dust accumulates faster at contact points and
            edges. The buildup can be gradual and uniform, or it can be concentrated in specific areas depending on the source
            of contamination. Seasonal variations in dust levels can lead to layering effects, with distinct layers of different
            compositions and colors. Timeframes: Hours - initial deposition of particles. Days - formation of a thin film.
            Months - thickening and compaction of the dust layer.'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light grey (#D3D3D3) or beige (#F5F5DC) due to the presence
            of silica and calcium carbonate. As iron oxide accumulates, the color shifts towards a reddish-brown (#A0522D).
            Organic particulates and soot contribute darker shades, ranging from dark grey (#A9A9A9) to near-black (#000000).
            Aged dust can exhibit a dull, ochre-like hue (#CC7722).
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravitational settling. Wind and airflow patterns can create streaks or localized concentrations. Point sources
            of contamination (e.g., nearby machinery) can lead to radial or gradient patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravitational settling. Edges and corners often accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to airflow patterns
            and electrostatic effects. Crevices and recessed areas act as traps for dust particles. Top surfaces exposed to
            the environment will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Individual dust particles or small clusters are visible, with the TiN
            surface largely exposed. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, discontinuous layer of dust covers a portion
            of the surface. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous layer of dust partially obscures the TiN
            surface. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick layer of dust significantly obscures the TiN surface. Thickness:
            20-50 μm. Extreme (>85%): The TiN surface is almost completely obscured by a thick, dense layer of dust. Thickness:
            >50 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Titanium Nitride typically presents as a heterogeneous layer with a muted, earthy
            tone. The dust layer often exhibits a powdery or slightly granular texture, with coverage patterns varying from
            sparse speckling to near-complete obscuration of the underlying TiN surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (common near machinery), gradient from source (common
            near vents), patchy/spotty (common in areas with variable airflow), streaky/linear (common due to rain or condensation),
            localized concentrations (common in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            effects. The edges act as barriers, causing dust particles to be deposited along the perimeter. The center areas
            may have slightly less dust accumulation, especially on larger surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces experience less dust accumulation but
            are prone to drip marks. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along their perimeter.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to higher concentrations.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in recessed areas. Runs down slopes are common after rain or condensation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight variations in color and texture. Depending on the composition and particle
            size, some iridescence may be observed, particularly with fine particulate matter.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine and powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution.
            Individual particles are often visible under magnification (100x or greater). The dust layer can feel slightly
            abrasive to the touch. In humid environments, the dust may become slightly sticky or crusty due to moisture absorption.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the dust layer can vary significantly, ranging from a thin film of 1-5 μm in relatively
            clean environments to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm or more in heavily polluted areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized sources), spots/dots (individual particles), stains (due to moisture), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (in crevices), drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The level of uniformity depends on factors such as airflow, surface orientation, and the proximity to
            contamination sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        tool steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust layer compacts and adheres more strongly. Color darkens due to oxidation and the incorporation of organic
            matter. Thickness increases gradually, potentially forming a hardened crust.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Begins at contact points (edges, crevices)
            and then spreads outward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in controlled environments. Point sources expand
            outward over days. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations influence dust
            composition and accumulation rates (e.g., pollen in spring).
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with hints of yellow (#F0E68C). Aged dust: Shifts towards
            reddish-brown (#A0522D) due to iron oxide formation. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black (#36454F). Pollen concentration:
            Yellowish-green (#9ACD32) speckles. Calcium carbonate rich areas: Off-white (#F8F8FF).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform. Horizontal surfaces tend to collect more dust than vertical
            surfaces. Edges and crevices act as traps, leading to thicker deposits. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical
            surfaces, especially after rain or condensation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in sheltered areas. Edges
            and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Top surfaces exposed to the environment will generally
            have higher concentrations than undersides. Crevices and indentations act as dust traps.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated specks and particles, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, steel surface still clearly visible. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, partially obscuring the steel.
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, steel surface largely obscured. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring all underlying
            details, potentially forming a crust. Thickness increases proportionally with coverage.'
          description: Environmental dust on tool steel presents as a fine, often uneven layer, typically exhibiting muted
            earth tones. The texture ranges from powdery to slightly adhered depending on humidity and time. Coverage varies
            significantly, from sparse speckling to near-complete obscuration of the underlying steel.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Edges
            act as barriers, preventing dust from being easily blown away. Center areas tend to have thinner, more uniform
            coverage. The mechanism is primarily related to airflow patterns and surface charge distribution.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Crevices act
            as traps, preventing dust from being easily removed. Flat areas allow for settling and accumulation. Vertical
            surfaces experience less accumulation due to gravity, but drip marks are common. Edges act as barriers, leading
            to buildup along their length.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling and accumulation. Sloped surfaces exhibit
            runs and streaks. Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to falling off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight variations in color and texture. Soot particles may exhibit a slight sheen. No significant iridescence
            is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and loose, easily disturbed by airflow. With moisture, it can become slightly
            sticky or crusty. Close inspection reveals a fine granular texture, sometimes with visible pollen grains or soot
            aggregates. Feels gritty to the touch, especially with heavier buildup.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with minimal
            disturbance, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), thick crusts (aged buildup, especially
            with moisture), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (individual dust particles or pollen grains),
            stains (caused by dissolved contaminants), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in corners and crevices), drip marks
            (on vertical surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is rare due to variations in airflow, surface texture,
            and exposure. The presence of crevices, edges, and other surface features disrupts uniform deposition. Air currents
            and electrostatic forces also contribute to non-uniformity.
        travertine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily removable film. Over time (months/years), the dust
            becomes more tightly bound to the travertine surface, darkening in color and potentially forming a harder, more
            cohesive layer. Iron oxide staining can become more prominent with age, leading to reddish-brown discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours/days) that is barely visible. It then thickens gradually
            (days/weeks), becoming more noticeable. Dust begins to accumulate at contact points (edges, crevices) and then
            spreads outward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources (vents) expand outward
            over time (weeks/months). Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition
            rates.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3 to #C0B283). Aged dust: Darker brownish-gray (#848482
            to #736F6E), sometimes with reddish-brown hues (#A0522D) due to iron oxide. Soot-rich areas: Dark gray to black
            (#36454F). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#EEE8AA).'
          common_patterns: Dust commonly accumulates in travertine's characteristic pits and voids, creating a speckled appearance.
            Streaks and drip marks are visible on vertical surfaces, especially after rain. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer. Edges and corners often show heavier buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners, in crevices and pits, and on horizontal
            surfaces. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with higher concentrations at the bottom due
            to gravity. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film, slightly obscures the travertine texture, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Clearly visible layer, partially
            obscures the travertine texture, 15-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick layer, significantly obscures the travertine
            texture, 50-150 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick layer, almost completely obscures the travertine texture,
            >150 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on travertine typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range of light tan to brownish-gray. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, creating
            a non-uniform coating that obscures the natural texture of the travertine.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (perimeter of tiles), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance from a source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface texture), streaky/linear (vertical surfaces
            due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in pits and voids).'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to a
            combination of factors: airflow patterns that concentrate dust at edges, electrostatic attraction at edges, and
            the tendency for dust to settle into low-lying areas. The center areas tend to be cleaner due to more frequent
            cleaning or exposure to airflow.'
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices and pits due to gravity and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to settling. It drips on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity and water runoff. It collects at edges due to airflow patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead
            surfaces is minimal due to the lack of adhesive forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            can highlight the uneven distribution of the dust, emphasizing shadows in crevices. No significant iridescence
            or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, feeling slightly gritty to the touch. At higher
            magnifications (100x+), individual particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen, angular mineral fragments, fibrous
            organic matter) can be observed. Aged dust can become slightly crusty due to moisture and mineral precipitation.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy accumulation
            in crevices: up to 500 μm (0.5 mm) or more.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            thin films (horizontal surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high moisture and mineral content), discrete patches
            (uneven surfaces), spots/dots (individual dust particles in pores), stains (iron oxide staining), uniform coatings
            (horizontal surfaces with low airflow), buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is affected by the travertine's inherent porosity and surface roughness, as well as airflow patterns and cleaning
            practices. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        tungsten:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a very light, almost imperceptible film. Color is
            typically light gray. Aged contamination (months/years): Becomes darker and more consolidated. Color shifts towards
            yellowish-brown or reddish-brown due to oxidation. The layer thickens and may become harder to remove.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days
            and weeks. Accumulation often begins at contact points (e.g., corners, edges) and then spreads inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is less common than localized buildup. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations
            in dust composition and concentration. Months of accumulation can lead to visible crusts and discoloration.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with hints of beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Yellowish-brown
            (#A07A55) due to iron oxide formation. Dust with high soot content: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to almost black (#000000).
            Dust with high calcium carbonate: Off-white (#F8F8FF) to light gray (#D3D3D3). Dust with high iron oxide: Burnt
            Sienna (#E97451) to Rust-Orange (#B7410E).'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices, corners, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces often exhibit streaks or drip marks due to gravity and moisture. Edges and areas with surface imperfections
            tend to attract more dust.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas have the highest concentrations.
            Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as isolated specks or a very faint dusting. Thickness: <1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): A thin, barely visible layer. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer that obscures
            the underlying surface. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, easily visible layer that significantly alters
            the surface appearance. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures
            the underlying surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on tungsten typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a matte finish.
            The color is generally a muted, earthy tone, ranging from light gray to reddish-brown, depending on the composition
            and age of the dust. Coverage can vary from sparse spotting to a complete, albeit thin, coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Uniform coating (rare, usually after specific events
            like construction). Edge accumulation (very common). Point source spreading (around vents or openings). Gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance). Patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface conditions).
            Streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            disruption. The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have lower concentrations
            unless there is a direct source of dust in that area.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices because these areas are sheltered from airflow. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on
            vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture. It collects at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow disruption.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Dust rarely hangs from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or
            electrostatic forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more matte and the color is more pronounced. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to wash out the color, making the dust appear lighter and grayer. There is generally
            no sheen or gloss unless the dust contains oily residues, in which case a slight sheen may be visible.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained. It feels slightly abrasive to the touch. At
            higher magnification (SEM), individual particles are visible, often angular or irregular in shape. In humid environments,
            it can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred
            micrometers (100-500 μm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 millimeters in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Thin films (initial stage). Drip marks (on vertical surfaces).
            Runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces). Discrete patches (due to localized sources). Spots/dots (small particles
            adhering to the surface). Stains (if the dust contains soluble components and is exposed to moisture). Buildups
            (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and
            the location of dust sources.
        tungsten carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks/months), the dust
            compacts and adheres more strongly to the surface, becoming darker and potentially developing a slightly crusty
            texture. Thickness increases gradually, and color variations become more pronounced due to chemical reactions
            (e.g., oxidation of iron).
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources
            expand outward, creating localized patches. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration. After months, the dust compacts and adheres more strongly, becoming more difficult to remove.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) to Off-White (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of Burnt Sienna (#E97451) where iron oxides are concentrated. Soot-rich areas: Dark Gray (#A9A9A9) to near Black
            (#000000). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-Gray (#C0C080).'
          common_patterns: Non-uniform coating is most common. Accumulation along edges and in crevices due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. Streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Localized spots around
            point sources of contamination (e.g., leaks, vents).
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices compared to flat, exposed
            surfaces. Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces due to settling. Corners and sheltered
            areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%): Patchy distribution
            with visible dust particles (5-10 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable dust layer with some areas still exposed
            (10-25 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Significant dust buildup, obscuring most of the surface (25-50 μm). Extreme (>85%):
            Thick, continuous dust layer completely covering the surface (50-200 μm).'
          description: Environmental dust on Tungsten Carbide typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a dominant color
            range from light gray to brownish-gray, often with localized darker patches due to soot or organic accumulation.
            The texture is generally powdery, and the distribution varies depending on the environment, but often shows edge
            accumulation and gravitational effects.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: 1) Edge accumulation: Dust concentrates along
            edges and corners. 2) Streaky/linear: Vertical streaks due to gravity and water runoff. 3) Patchy/spotty: Irregular
            distribution due to localized sources or uneven surface conditions. 4) Gradient from source: Concentration decreases
            with distance from a contamination source. 5) Localized concentrations: Buildup in crevices and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
            The edges act as collection points for airborne particles. The center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform
            layer of dust. This behavior is driven by the increased surface area and charge density at edges.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to have a more uniform but thinner layer of dust. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks.
            Edges act as collection points, leading to higher dust concentrations. Depressions and indentations fill with
            dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on
            vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks. Overhead
            surfaces may have dust hanging in loose formations, eventually detaching due to gravity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle color variations and highlights the powdery texture. No significant iridescence or rainbow
            effects are typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Powdery and fine-grained to the touch. Under magnification (100x), individual particles are visible,
            ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. Can become slightly sticky or crusty in humid environments
            due to hygroscopic components like calcium carbonate. No inherent crystalline structure is typically visible without
            specialized analysis.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (sparse coverage) to a heavy buildup of 50-200 μm (extreme
            coverage). In extreme cases, localized accumulations can reach up to 500 μm or even 1 mm in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: Initial layer of dust covering the surface. 2) Drip
            marks: Vertical streaks formed by water runoff carrying dust. 3) Runs/streaks: Similar to drip marks but less
            defined. 4) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of dust accumulation. 5) Buildups: Thick accumulations in sheltered
            areas. 6) Stains: Discoloration of the surface due to chemical reactions with the dust.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in airflow, surface charge, and contamination sources. It is typically concentrated in specific areas, such as
            edges and crevices. Uniformity is further reduced by gravity and surface irregularities.
        urethane composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more consolidated, adhering more strongly to the surface. Color darkens over time due
            to the accumulation of soot and organic matter. Thickness increases, and the texture may become slightly crusty
            in areas exposed to repeated wetting and drying cycles.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, dust accumulates at contact
            points and edges. Over weeks, the film thickens and spreads. Over months, layering effects become visible, with
            distinct strata of dust from different environmental events. Seasonal variations in pollen and soot concentration
            can influence the color and composition of the dust layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with slight beige undertones. Aged dust (weeks): Medium brown
            (#A67B5B) with hints of rust-orange (#B7410E) due to iron oxide. Heavily soiled: Dark gray (#4A4A4A) to almost
            black (#000000) in areas with high soot concentration. Pollen-rich: Yellowish-brown (#C2B280) cast. Calcium Carbonate
            rich: Off-white (#F5F5DC) cast.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate more heavily on horizontal surfaces due to gravitational settling. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks from rainwater runoff. Edges and crevices act as collection points, leading
            to thicker deposits in these areas. Areas sheltered from wind and rain accumulate dust more rapidly.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and crevices exhibit higher concentrations than flat surfaces. The top of a vertical surface may be cleaner
            than the bottom due to rainwater washing. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light speckling, barely visible. Typical thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film. Typical thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, partially obscuring the underlying
            surface. Typical thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, significantly obscuring the underlying surface.
            Typical thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, obscuring the underlying surface completely. Typical
            thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on urethane composites typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with
            a dominant color range of light to dark browns and grays. Coverage varies significantly depending on environmental
            conditions and surface orientation, ranging from sparse speckling to a thick, obscuring coating. The dust tends
            to accumulate in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge
            accumulation along raised features. 3) Streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to rainwater runoff. 4)
            Patchy/spotty distribution in areas exposed to intermittent rain or wind. 5) Localized concentrations in crevices
            and depressions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to reduced airflow
            and the barrier effect of the edge. The center of a flat surface may exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating.
            This is due to the edge acting as a collection point for airborne particles.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and gravitational settling. Flat
            areas allow for uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as barriers, causing
            dust to accumulate along their perimeter. Depressions and indentations trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of airborne dust. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs precariously until disturbed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal specular reflection. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The dust layer generally lacks iridescence or rainbow
            effects unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from fine and powdery to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size distribution.
            It feels dry to the touch unless mixed with moisture. Close inspection reveals a heterogeneous mixture of fine
            particles, with occasional larger grains of sand or organic matter. The surface is generally matte, lacking significant
            gloss.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 100-500 μm or more in heavily soiled regions. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 mm in sheltered crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Drip marks and runs/streaks
            on vertical surfaces. 3) Thick crusts in areas exposed to repeated wetting and drying. 4) Discrete patches in
            areas sheltered from rain. 5) Buildups in crevices and along edges. 6) Stains where moisture has dissolved and
            redeposited contaminants.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface orientation, wind exposure, rainfall patterns, and the
            presence of surface features (e.g., edges, crevices). Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical
            surfaces.
        vanadium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time, it becomes more compacted
            and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color shifts towards darker shades of brown and gray as organic matter
            decomposes and reacts with the vanadium surface. Thickness increases gradually, and the texture becomes more consolidated.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film, often initiated at contact points or surface irregularities.
            It then spreads outward, gradually thickening over time. Edges tend to accumulate dust first, followed by the
            center areas. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition and deposition rates.
            This process can take hours for a barely visible layer, days for a light coating, and months for a significant
            buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to beige (#F5F5DC). Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown
            (#A0522D) due to iron oxide content to a darker, sooty gray (#696969) when carbonaceous material is present. In
            areas with high calcium carbonate, a chalky off-white (#FAF9F6) may be observed. Pollen can add a yellowish tint
            (#FFFFE0) during certain seasons.'
          common_patterns: Dust tends to accumulate in sheltered areas, such as crevices, corners, and horizontal surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks and drip marks due to rain or condensation. Edges and welds are common
            accumulation points. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravitational settling. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            attraction. Crevices and depressions act as collection points. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed
            areas. Top surfaces exposed to rain may have lower concentrations than sheltered undersides.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy layer, visible but easily removed, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures the
            original surface color, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring layer, difficult to remove, thickness
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, significant alteration of surface appearance, thickness >100
            μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on vanadium typically presents as a fine, particulate layer with a muted, earthy
            tone. The color is often a blend of browns, grays, and reddish-browns, influenced by the local soil composition
            and industrial pollutants. Coverage varies from sparse to heavy, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            2) Edge accumulation (very common), 3) Point source spreading (around vents or openings), 4) Gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow or surface irregularities),
            6) Streaky/linear (due to rain or condensation runoff), 7) Localized concentrations (in crevices or depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and electrostatic
            charge buildup. The edges act as collection points, disrupting the airflow and causing particles to deposit. The
            center areas may have lower concentrations due to higher airflow and less electrostatic attraction.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer of dust. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking.
            Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them. Depressions and pits fill with dust over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Dust settles on horizontal surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges. Runs develop down slopes. Overhanging surfaces may accumulate dust that hangs precariously before falling.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the variations in color and texture. Depending on the composition, some
            particles may exhibit a slight sheen or sparkle, particularly if they contain metallic oxides or crystalline silica.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to silt. When lightly deposited, it
            feels slightly gritty. With heavier accumulation, it can become crusty, especially if exposed to moisture and
            subsequent drying. Under magnification, individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 50-500 μm or more in heavily contaminated zones. In extreme cases, crusts exceeding 1 mm can form.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (due to water
            runoff), 3) Thin films (early stages of contamination), 4) Thick crusts (in areas with prolonged exposure and
            moisture), 5) Discrete patches (due to localized sources), 6) Spots/dots (individual particles or small aggregates),
            7) Stains (discoloration of the vanadium surface due to chemical reactions with dust components), 8) Buildups
            (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in airflow, surface roughness, and electrostatic charge. The level of uniformity depends
            heavily on the environmental conditions and the geometry of the vanadium surface.
        walnut:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Over time, the dust becomes more
            compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to the incorporation of organic matter and
            the oxidation of iron compounds. Thickness increases gradually.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points and edges. Over days, the
            film thickens and spreads. After a week, accumulation becomes noticeable in crevices. Over months, a thicker,
            more compacted layer forms, with layering effects visible in sheltered areas. Seasonal variations in pollen and
            soot contribute to changes in color and composition.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #D2B48C (tan), Aged dust (1-2 weeks): #A68A64 (sandy brown), Heavily soiled/aged
            dust (months): #8B4513 (brown with reddish undertones), Soot-rich dust: #36454F (charcoal gray), Pollen-rich dust
            (seasonal): #E4D00A (yellowish-tan)'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in recessed areas, such as pores and grain lines. On horizontal
            surfaces, a more uniform layer forms. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks, especially after rain
            or condensation. Edges and corners tend to collect thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Top surfaces tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces. Corners and areas near windows or vents exhibit
            heavier contamination. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, a slight dulling of the surface. Thickness: <5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): a thin, easily disturbed film. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): a noticeable layer, partially
            obscuring the wood grain. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): a thick layer, significantly obscuring the wood
            grain. Thickness: 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): a very thick, obscuring layer. Thickness: >250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on walnut presents as a fine, matte layer, typically ranging from light tan to reddish-brown.
            It tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating a subtle contrast with the underlying wood grain.
            The overall effect is a dulling of the walnut's natural luster.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along borders, point source spreading from localized contamination, gradient from source (e.g., window sill),
            patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven airflow, streaky/linear patterns on vertical surfaces due to gravity
            and water runoff, and localized concentrations in crevices and pores.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to a combination
            of factors, including airflow patterns, electrostatic attraction, and the sheltering effect of edges. The center
            areas of flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. It builds up
            in crevices because these areas are sheltered from wind and rain. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips
            on vertical surfaces due to gravity and water runoff. It collects at edges due to surface tension and airflow.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Dust settles on horizontal
            surfaces due to gravity. Runs down slopes are also observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is not typical unless
            the dust is mixed with a sticky substance.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte and slightly reflective, scattering light
            diffusely. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the dullness and color variations. There is no significant
            sheen or gloss unless the dust is mixed with oils or moisture.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine, with a slightly gritty feel due to the presence of silica
            and other mineral particles. It's not typically sticky unless mixed with moisture or oils. At high magnification
            (SEM), individual particles of varying sizes and shapes are visible, including spherical pollen grains and angular
            mineral fragments.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 250 μm (heavy buildup in crevices). On flat,
            exposed surfaces, the thickness is usually between 10-50 μm. In sheltered areas, it can reach up to 500 μm or
            even 1 mm over extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in sheltered areas, drip
            marks on vertical surfaces, discrete patches where dust has settled, stains from water-soluble components, and
            buildups in corners and crevices. No crystalline structures are typically observed without specific chemical reactions.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due
            to variations in surface texture, airflow, and exposure. Uniformity is higher on smooth, horizontal surfaces and
            lower on complex geometries with crevices and edges.
        willow:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust becomes more compacted and adheres more strongly to the surface. Color darkens due to oxidation of iron compounds
            and the incorporation of organic matter. Thickness increases gradually with continued deposition.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often concentrated at contact points (e.g., where leaves
            overlap). It then spreads outward from these points, gradually covering the entire surface. Edges tend to accumulate
            dust first, followed by the center areas. Layering effects may occur due to seasonal variations in dust composition
            and deposition rates. This process can take days to months to reach significant levels.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light tan (#E0DAC0) with subtle grey undertones. Aged dust: Ranges from a muted reddish-brown
            (#A07A55) to a darker, more saturated brown (#6B4F32) due to iron oxide oxidation. Soot-rich areas: Dark grey
            to almost black (#333333). Pollen-rich areas: Yellowish-tan (#F0E68C).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is typically non-uniform. Dust tends to concentrate along edges of leaves and branches,
            in crevices of the bark, and on horizontal surfaces. Streaking patterns are common on vertical surfaces due to
            rain or dew washing away some of the dust, leaving behind residue.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces
            due to gravitational settling. Edges and crevices accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Sheltered areas (e.g.,
            undersides of leaves) may have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Top surfaces of horizontal branches will
            have higher concentrations than the bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a very light dusting. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy coating
            that partially obscures the underlying surface. Moderate (30-60%): A more noticeable coating that significantly
            alters the color of the surface. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, almost complete coating that largely obscures the underlying
            surface. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, dense coating that completely obscures the underlying surface; thickness
            >200 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on willow presents as a fine, matte layer, typically ranging from light tan to reddish-brown.
            The dust tends to accumulate more heavily in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coating that obscures
            the underlying green of the willow bark. The overall appearance is often dry and powdery.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: edge accumulation (along leaf margins and branch
            edges), crevice filling (in bark fissures), point source spreading (around localized sources of contamination),
            and streaky/linear patterns (on vertical surfaces due to water runoff). A gradient from source is also possible
            if there is a nearby industrial source.'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental Dust Layer preferentially accumulates at edges due to aerodynamic effects and
            the trapping of particles. The edges act as barriers, causing dust to deposit along them. The center areas tend
            to have less dust due to greater wind exposure.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced wind exposure and the trapping of particles.
            Flat areas tend to collect more dust than curved surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges
            act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more dust than vertical surfaces due to settling. Runs
            down slopes are common after rain events.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears slightly lighter in color and more matte. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the grey undertones. There is no significant sheen or gloss, even under
            bright light. The layer is generally non-reflective.
          texture_details: Feels powdery and slightly gritty to the touch due to the presence of silica and other mineral
            particles. At a microscopic level, the dust layer exhibits a heterogeneous texture with varying particle sizes
            and shapes. It is generally non-reflective and matte, lacking any significant gloss or sheen.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 200 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with minimal
            disturbance, buildup can reach up to 500 μm. The thickness varies significantly depending on exposure and cleaning
            frequency.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages), discrete patches (localized contamination),
            drip marks (on vertical surfaces), stains (where moisture has dissolved some of the dust components), and buildups
            (in sheltered areas). No crystalline structures are expected.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy. It is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface texture, wind exposure, and the presence of sheltered areas. The level of uniformity is influenced
            by wind direction and the proximity to dust sources.
        wrought iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, powdery film with a relatively uniform
            color. Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes darker, more consolidated, and may exhibit color variations
            due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of iron). Thickness increases, and the texture becomes rougher.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual particles deposited randomly on the surface (hours).
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more uniform. Over weeks, dust accumulates preferentially in crevices
            and along edges. Over months, the dust layer consolidates and may undergo chemical changes (e.g., oxidation).
            Seasonal variations in dust deposition rates can lead to layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: #A0785A (light brown, similar to raw umber). Aged dust: #804A00 (dark brown, like
            burnt umber). Dust with high iron oxide content: #B7410E (rust-orange). Dust with high calcium carbonate: #E5E5E5
            (off-white, chalky). Soot-rich dust: #36454F (charcoal gray).'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit streaks and drip marks due to gravity. Areas sheltered from rain or wind tend to have thicker
            deposits. A common pattern is a gradient of dust concentration, with higher levels near the base of vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces compared to vertical surfaces.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and indentations act as traps for
            dust particles. The bottom of vertical surfaces often has a higher concentration due to gravity-induced runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light, barely visible film, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            coating, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with some surface features obscured, thickness
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating obscuring most surface features, thickness 100-250 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, crusty buildup completely obscuring the original surface, thickness > 250 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on wrought iron typically presents as a matte, slightly granular coating with a
            dominant color range of muted browns and reddish-browns. The distribution is often uneven, accumulating more heavily
            in crevices and along edges, creating a subtly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), point source spreading
            (from bird droppings or other localized sources), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance
            from a source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to rain or wind), localized concentrations
            (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to airflow patterns and surface
            tension effects. Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles carried by wind or water. The center areas of
            flat surfaces may have a slightly thinner layer due to wind scouring.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and increased surface area. Flat
            areas tend to collect dust more readily than curved surfaces. Vertical surfaces experience drip marks and streaking.
            Edges act as barriers, trapping dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of dust particles. Slopes exhibit runs and streaks.
            Overhead surfaces may accumulate dust, but it is more prone to dislodging.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle variations in color and texture. Soot-rich dust absorbs light, appearing darker and less reflective.
            High humidity can cause a slight darkening and increased adherence.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from slightly powdery to weakly adherent. It feels gritty to the touch, especially
            with higher concentrations of silica. Under magnification (10x-20x), individual particles are visible, creating
            a slightly rough surface. Aged dust can become more consolidated and crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from 5 μm (thin film) to 500 μm (heavy buildup). In sheltered areas with
            minimal cleaning, buildup can reach up to 1 mm or more over several years.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water flow),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas), discrete patches (from localized sources),
            spots/dots (from individual particles), stains (from organic matter), uniform coatings (rare, only in very sheltered
            environments), buildups (in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare due to variations in surface geometry, exposure to wind and rain, and the presence of localized contamination
            sources. Horizontal surfaces tend to be more uniform than vertical surfaces.
        yttria-stabilized zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily disturbed film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more consolidated, darker in color (due to oxidation and organic decomposition), and more
            difficult to remove. Thickness increases, and the texture becomes more crusty or cemented.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It begins at contact points and edges,
            then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward
            over days. Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration. Over months,
            the dust consolidates and thickens, forming a more cohesive layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to pale yellow (#FAFAD2). Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C)
            with hints of rust-orange (#A0522D) where iron is present. Heavily contaminated/aged: Reddish-brown (#8B4513)
            with darker, almost black (#000000) soot deposits in sheltered areas. Color varies significantly based on local
            dust composition.'
          common_patterns: Dust accumulates preferentially in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to airflow patterns
            and electrostatic attraction. On vertical surfaces, streaks and drip marks are common. Horizontal surfaces exhibit
            more uniform coverage, but with variations due to particle settling.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to be heavier than the center.
            Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than undersides. Crevices and sheltered areas have the highest
            concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Very light dusting, barely visible, 1-2 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy film, slightly alters surface color, 2-10 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures original
            surface in places, 10-30 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Substantial coating, significantly alters surface appearance,
            30-100 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Thick, obscuring layer, may form crusts, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) typically presents as a fine, matte layer with
            a color range from light tan to reddish-brown, depending on the iron oxide content. The dust tends to accumulate
            unevenly, often concentrating in crevices and along edges, creating a subtly textured surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to electrostatic effects and
            airflow), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with
            distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven settling), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation),
            and localized concentrations (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic effects and airflow
            patterns. The mechanism is a combination of increased surface area at edges and the tendency of charged particles
            to be attracted to edges. Center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas allow for more uniform settling. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping and streaking. Edges act as collection points. Depressions and pits trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks
            on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Dust rarely hangs from overhead surfaces unless bound by moisture or electrostatic
            forces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears more vibrant, with reddish-brown hues becoming more
            pronounced. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the color and highlight the matte texture. There is typically
            no significant sheen or iridescence, unless oily contaminants are present.
          texture_details: Initially, the dust feels powdery and slightly abrasive. Over time, moisture and organic matter
            can cause it to become sticky or slightly crusty. At a microscopic level, individual particles are angular and
            irregular. The overall texture is matte, lacking significant gloss unless oils are present.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup of
            50-200 μm in heavily contaminated areas or crevices. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm in sheltered
            locations.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas), discrete patches (due to localized sources),
            spots/dots (due to individual particle settling), stains (where moisture has dissolved contaminants), and buildups
            (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on airflow, surface orientation, and the presence of electrostatic
            charges. Sheltered areas and crevices tend to have higher concentrations.
        yttrium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, easily disturbed layer. Over time (weeks to months), the
            dust compacts, darkens in color due to organic decomposition and iron oxidation, and becomes more difficult to
            remove. Thickness increases with continued exposure. May develop a slightly sticky or oily feel due to absorbed
            moisture and organic breakdown.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). Begins at contact points and
            edges, then spreads inward (days to weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is rare. Point sources expand outward
            (days to weeks). Layering effects occur with seasonal variations in dust composition and concentration (months).
            Significant buildup is noticeable after several months of exposure.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with slight Yellowish-Brown tint (#C19A6B). Aged dust: Dull
            Brown (#A67B5B) with Rust-Orange specks (#B7410E) from iron oxide. Heavily soiled: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A) with possible
            greenish tinge from organic matter. Pollen-rich: Yellowish-Green (#9ACD32) localized spots.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often non-uniform, with heavier deposits in sheltered areas and along edges. Streaks
            and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more even layer. Crevices
            and corners act as collection points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns. Top surfaces of horizontal components tend to accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces.
            Sheltered areas exhibit higher concentrations compared to exposed areas. Vertical walls show a gradient from top
            to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a light dusting. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): A
            thin, patchy film. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A noticeable layer, obscuring the original surface slightly.
            Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, obscuring layer. Thickness: 50-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick,
            obscuring layer, potentially forming crusts. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Environmental dust on Yttrium typically presents as a light to moderate coating, exhibiting a range
            of earthy tones. The texture is generally powdery, with accumulation varying based on surface orientation and
            airflow patterns. Coverage can range from sparse to heavy, depending on exposure duration and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in very controlled environments), edge
            accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due
            to gravity and moisture), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns.
            Edges act as collection points for airborne particles. Center areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform layer.
            This effect is more pronounced on smaller components.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation. Builds up in crevices, acting as particle traps.
            Pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges
            due to electrostatic forces and airflow patterns. Follows contours to some extent, but sharp edges disrupt uniform
            deposition.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in drip marks and vertical streaking. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker deposits. Runs
            down slopes, creating visible trails. Hanging from overhead surfaces is minimal due to Yttrium's surface energy,
            but some dust can adhere.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically
            observed. Darker, aged deposits absorb more light, appearing less reflective.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine, becoming slightly compacted and crusty with moisture absorption over
            time. Grain size varies from sub-micrometer to several micrometers depending on the source. Feels slightly abrasive
            to the touch. Under high magnification, individual particles of varying shapes (spherical pollen, angular mineral
            fragments, fibrous organic matter) are visible.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a thicker layer of
            50-200 μm in heavily soiled regions. Extreme buildup in sheltered areas can reach up to 500 μm or more.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to moisture), thin films (on exposed surfaces),
            thick crusts (in areas with repeated wetting and drying), discrete patches (due to localized sources), spots/dots
            (individual particle deposition), stains (from dissolved contaminants), buildups (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is rare due to variations in airflow, surface orientation,
            and particle deposition mechanisms. Even on seemingly uniform surfaces, microscopic examination reveals significant
            variations in particle density and composition.
        zinc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly adhered, darker in color, and may exhibit signs of consolidation or cementation
            due to moisture and chemical reactions. The thickness also increases over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film of individual dust particles deposited on the surface. Over time,
            these particles accumulate and coalesce, forming a more continuous layer. The layer thickens gradually, with faster
            accumulation in sheltered areas and along edges. Seasonal variations in dust concentration and humidity can lead
            to layering effects, with distinct layers of different colors and textures. The timeframe for significant buildup
            can range from days to months, depending on environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light grey (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5DC). Aged dust (weeks): Tan (#D2B48C) to
            light brown (#A68B64) with possible reddish-brown (#8B4513) tinges from iron oxide. Heavily soiled areas: Dark
            grey (#4A4A4A) to almost black (#222222) due to soot accumulation.'
          common_patterns: The dust typically distributes non-uniformly, with higher concentrations in sheltered areas, crevices,
            and along edges. Vertical surfaces often exhibit streaks and drip marks, while horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more even layer. Areas exposed to direct wind or rain may be relatively clean.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            gravitational settling. Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more dust than flat surfaces due to electrostatic
            attraction and airflow patterns. Top surfaces exposed to rain may be cleaner than sheltered bottom surfaces. Corners
            and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, slightly alters surface appearance, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable layer, obscures some surface
            details, 15-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, obscuring layer, significantly alters surface appearance, 50-100
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, completely obscures surface details, >100 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on zinc typically presents as a matte, slightly granular layer with a dominant color
            range from light grey to brownish-grey, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate
            in crevices and along edges, creating a non-uniform coverage pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to electrostatic attraction
            and airflow patterns), point source spreading (from localized sources like chimneys or vents), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition and removal),
            streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation runoff).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to electrostatic attraction and
            airflow patterns. The edges act as collection points, leading to higher dust concentrations compared to the center
            areas. This is especially noticeable on flat panels and around openings.
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction.
            Flat areas tend to accumulate a more uniform layer, while vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as collection
            points, leading to higher dust concentrations. Depressions and scratches trap dust particles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of dust particles, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate a thicker layer of dust due to settling. Slopes exhibit runs
            and streaks as dust is washed down by rain or condensation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the granular texture and color variations. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow
            effect unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and slightly abrasive to the touch. At low magnification (10-50x),
            individual dust particles are visible, creating a granular appearance. In areas with high humidity or condensation,
            the dust can become slightly sticky or crusty.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for freshly deposited dust to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm or more in sheltered areas over extended periods. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 1 mm
            in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (on relatively clean surfaces), thick crusts (in areas
            with high humidity and dust accumulation), discrete patches (due to localized sources or uneven deposition), spots/dots
            (from individual dust particles or water droplets), stains (from dissolved contaminants), drip marks (on vertical
            surfaces), buildups (in crevices and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in surface geometry, airflow, and exposure to the elements. Uniformity
            is higher on smooth, horizontal surfaces sheltered from wind and rain.
        zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a light, easily removable film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes more tightly adhered, darker in color due to chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of
            iron), and potentially forms a harder, more crust-like layer. Thickness increases over time, and layering effects
            from repeated deposition events become visible.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye, within hours of exposure.
            Over days, the film thickens and becomes more visible, starting at contact points and edges. After weeks, the
            dust spreads inward from the edges, forming a more continuous coating. Over months, layering effects become apparent
            due to repeated deposition events, and the dust becomes more tightly adhered. Seasonal variations in dust composition
            and concentration can lead to distinct layers with different colors and textures.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light grayish-tan (#D3D3D3) with subtle yellow undertones. Aged contamination:
            Ranges from a muted reddish-brown (#A0522D) to a darker, almost chocolate brown (#3E2723) in areas of higher concentration.
            Areas with higher iron oxide content exhibit rust-orange hues (#B7410E). Soot presence shifts the color towards
            a dark gray (#4A4A4A).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include a general coating with heavier accumulation in crevices and along edges.
            Streaks and drip marks are observed on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a more uniform layer. Areas sheltered from wind and rain may exhibit thicker, more concentrated deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier concentrations
            due to airflow patterns and electrostatic attraction. Top surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more dust than
            bottom surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit the highest concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient
            from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, 1-2 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, slightly alters surface color, 2-5 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, obscures original surface
            texture, 5-20 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, uneven layer, significantly alters surface appearance, 20-50 μm
            thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crust-like buildup, completely obscures original surface, >50 μm thick.'
          description: Environmental dust on zirconia typically presents as a matte, slightly textured layer with a dominant
            color range from light tan to reddish-brown. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry, leading to variations in thickness and concentration across the surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only in controlled environments),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: 'Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to a combination of factors: increased
            surface area, electrostatic attraction, and airflow patterns that concentrate particles at boundaries. The center
            areas tend to have a thinner, more uniform coating, unless there are specific point sources of contamination.'
          geometry_effects: Dust accumulates in corners due to airflow stagnation. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered
            areas. It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity and
            condensation. It collects at edges due to electrostatic attraction and airflow patterns. It follows contours,
            conforming to the surface shape. It bridges gaps, forming dust bridges between adjacent surfaces. It fills depressions,
            creating a smoother overall surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is
            common due to rain or condensation. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Dust can
            hang from overhead surfaces, forming small stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer appears matte with minimal gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals subtle variations in color and texture. The presence of organic particulates can cause a slight dulling
            effect. No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and fine to slightly gritty, depending on the particle size and
            composition of the dust. It feels dry to the touch. At higher magnification (SEM), individual particles of varying
            shapes and sizes are visible, including spherical pollen grains, angular mineral fragments, and irregular soot
            aggregates.
          thickness_range: Typical thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm in lightly contaminated areas to a heavy buildup
            of 50-200 μm in areas of high accumulation, such as crevices or sheltered corners. Extreme cases can reach up
            to 500 μm in industrial settings with high dust levels.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff),
            thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (in sheltered areas with prolonged exposure), discrete patches
            (due to localized deposition), spots/dots (from individual particle impacts), stains (from dissolved contaminants),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Uniformity is affected by airflow patterns, surface orientation, electrostatic charge, and the presence
            of surface imperfections. Sheltered areas accumulate more dust than exposed areas.
        zirconium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, almost imperceptible film. Over time (days to weeks), the
            dust darkens and becomes more visible as it absorbs moisture and reacts with the environment. Months or years
            of exposure lead to a thicker, more consolidated layer with a reddish-brown or rust-colored appearance, often
            with localized crusting.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, the
            film thickens and becomes more visible, especially at edges and in crevices. After weeks, the dust begins to consolidate
            and darken. Months of exposure lead to a thick, crusty layer with significant color variations. Seasonal variations
            in humidity and dust concentration can create layering effects.
          color_variations: 'Fresh dust: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to off-white (#F5F5F5). Slightly aged: Tan (#D2B48C) with hints
            of yellow. Moderately aged: Light brown (#A68A64) with reddish undertones due to iron oxide. Heavily aged: Rust-orange
            (#B7410E) to dark brown (#654321) in areas of high accumulation.'
          common_patterns: The dust commonly forms a non-uniform coating, with heavier accumulation in sheltered areas and
            along edges. Streaks and drip marks are often visible on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is also common around
            fasteners and other surface features.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            settling. Edges and corners accumulate more dust than flat surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas exhibit the
            highest concentrations. Top surfaces exposed to the environment accumulate more dust than bottom surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a light dusting. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film,
            easily wiped off. Moderate (30-60%): A more visible, continuous layer with some variations in thickness. Heavy
            (60-85%): A thick, noticeable layer with significant color variations and crusting in some areas. Extreme (>85%):
            A very thick, consolidated layer that obscures the underlying zirconium surface.'
          description: Environmental dust on zirconium typically presents as a fine, matte layer with a color range from light
            gray to brownish-red, depending on the composition and age of the dust. The dust tends to accumulate in crevices
            and along edges, creating a non-uniform coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), point source spreading
            (around vents or openings), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due
            to uneven airflow), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to gravity and moisture), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices and depressions).'
          edge_center_behavior: Environmental dust preferentially accumulates at edges due to reduced airflow and electrostatic
            effects. The perimeter of the zirconium surface acts as a collection point. The center areas tend to have a thinner,
            more uniform layer of dust.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Dust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and electrostatic attraction. Flat areas tend to collect a more uniform layer. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Edges act as barriers, causing dust to accumulate along them.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow of dust particles and moisture. This
            results in pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, and settling on horizontal
            surfaces. The settling velocity of dust particles varies depending on their size and density, but larger particles
            settle more quickly.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the dust layer typically exhibits a matte finish with minimal gloss. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the variations in color and thickness. No iridescence or rainbow effects are
            typically observed unless oil or other contaminants are present.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery and fine-grained, similar to talcum powder when lightly deposited.
            Heavier accumulations can become slightly crusty or clumpy, especially if exposed to moisture. It feels slightly
            abrasive to the touch. At high magnification, individual particles of varying shapes and sizes are visible.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a light dusting to several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm) or even up to 1 mm in areas of heavy accumulation, especially in crevices or sheltered locations.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (initial deposition), drip marks (on vertical surfaces),
            runs/streaks (due to moisture), thick crusts (in areas of heavy accumulation and moisture), discrete patches (due
            to localized sources), spots/dots (individual particles), and stains (from dissolved contaminants).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in airflow, surface roughness, electrostatic charge, and the
            presence of surface features that act as dust traps.

        ceramic:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Aged contamination becomes thicker, darker,
            and more matte. It often hardens and forms a crusty or gummy residue that is difficult to remove. The color darkens
            significantly, and the surface becomes rougher due to the accumulation of dirt and debris.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or near the source of contamination.
            It then spreads outwards, often following edges and crevices. Over time, the film thickens and darkens due to
            oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Point sources expand outwards, and layering effects can occur
            with repeated contamination events. This process can take hours for a visible film to form, days for noticeable
            discoloration, and months for a significant buildup to develop.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent or light amber/honey color. As it ages and
            oxidizes, it darkens to shades of brownish-yellow, dark brown, and eventually black. In some cases, especially
            with metalworking fluids, a greenish-brown tint can be present due to the presence of dissolved metals.
          common_patterns: Oil and grease tend to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges due to gravity and surface
            tension. Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks near the source of the leak or application.
            Over time, these spots can coalesce and spread, forming a more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices where oil and grease
            can accumulate. Horizontal surfaces often have a more uniform coating than vertical surfaces, where gravity causes
            drips and runs. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to washing or wiping, while sheltered areas accumulate
            more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, very thin film. Light (10-30%): patchy distribution,
            thin layer, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable coating, thicker layer, distinct discoloration.
            Heavy (60-85%): significant buildup, thick and sticky layer, dark color. Extreme (>85%): almost complete coverage,
            very thick crust, heavily soiled appearance.'
          description: Industrial oil and grease buildup on ceramic surfaces typically presents as a discolored, often darkened,
            coating that can range from a barely visible sheen to a thick, sticky layer. The color is usually darker than
            the original ceramic, and the texture varies from smooth and oily to rough and crusty depending on the age and
            type of contaminant.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (along joints and seams), point
            source spreading (radiating outwards from a leak), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to inconsistent application), streaky/linear (resulting from drips or runs),
            and localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on ceramic
            surfaces. This is due to surface tension effects, where the oil/grease is drawn to the edges and corners. The
            edges act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading further and leading to buildup. Center areas may have
            a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil and grease accumulate in corners and
            crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas allow for pooling, while vertical surfaces promote
            dripping. Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading further and leading to buildup. Depressions
            and grooves fill up with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil and grease
            can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil and grease can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting may reveal subtle color variations and surface irregularities. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish and absorbs light, making it appear darker and less reflective. Iridescence is rare but possible with very
            thin films.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth and oily when fresh, to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry,
            and eventually hard and crusty as it ages and oxidizes. Dust and debris often become embedded in the grease, creating
            a rough, sandpaper-like surface. At a microscopic level, the buildup may exhibit a layered or striated structure
            due to repeated applications and drying cycles.
          thickness_range: The thickness can range from a thin film of a few micrometers (µm) to a heavy buildup of several
            millimeters (mm). A light coating might be paper-thin, while a heavy buildup could be coin-thick or thicker in
            extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks caused by gravity), runs/streaks (similar
            to drip marks but less defined), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (early stages of contamination),
            thick crusts (aged, hardened buildup), discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), spots/dots (small,
            localized deposits), and stains (discoloration of the ceramic surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare due to variations in surface roughness, application methods, and environmental factors. The non-uniformity
            is caused by the interplay of gravity, surface tension, and the viscosity of the oil/grease.
        metal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, often transparent film that is easily wiped away. Over time,
            it darkens in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous or solid. Aged contamination is often more difficult to
            remove, forming a hard, crusty layer that may require specialized cleaning methods. Oxidation and polymerization
            contribute to the hardening and darkening process.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin, often invisible film that gradually thickens over time. Begins at contact
            points (e.g., leaks, drips) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate
            of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes: Noticeable film within hours, visible buildup within days, significant crusting
            within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Translucent amber or light yellow. Mildly Aged: Light brown to tan. Moderately Aged: Medium
            to dark brown, sometimes with reddish hues due to rust staining. Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black, often with
            greenish or greyish tinges from oxidation or microbial growth. Heat-affected: Blueish-black or iridescent.'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, accumulation in corners and crevices,
            and a general tendency to spread from the point of origin. Streaks and runs are common on inclined surfaces. Flat
            horizontal surfaces often exhibit a more uniform coating, while vertical surfaces show more pronounced gravitational
            effects.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavy concentration: Corners, crevices, low-lying areas, and areas directly below the
            source of contamination. Light concentration: Elevated surfaces, areas exposed to airflow, and areas that have
            been partially cleaned. Vertical surfaces tend to have a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to
            gravity.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy coating, easily wiped away. Moderate (30-60%): Visible coating, some areas still clean, requires more effort
            to remove. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating, difficult to remove. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, encrusted
            layer, may obscure the underlying surface features.'
          description: Industrial oil and grease buildup on metal surfaces typically presents as a discolored, often glossy
            or matte coating that can range from a barely perceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color varies depending
            on the type of oil/grease, contaminants present, and age, but generally progresses from light to dark shades.
            Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced by gravity, surface geometry, and the source of contamination.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak), Streaky/linear
            (from dripping or wiping), Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Gradient from source (decreasing thickness
            with distance), Patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal), and Uniform coating (rare, but possible with intentional
            application).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to surface tension. The oil/grease
            tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a visible line or buildup. Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform
            coating, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Collects at edges, forming
            a visible line. Follows contours of the surface, accentuating imperfections. Fills depressions and small holes.
          gravity_influence: Strong downward flow behavior on vertical and inclined surfaces. Pooling at bottom edges and
            in low-lying areas. Drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational
            effects. Settling on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform coating.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease often exhibits a glossy or wet appearance under direct lighting, reflecting light
            specularly. As it ages and oxidizes, the surface becomes more matte and absorbs more light. Iridescence or rainbow
            effects can be observed in thin films due to interference. Under fluorescent lighting, the color may appear slightly
            different compared to sunlight.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Mildly Aged: Slightly sticky or tacky. Moderately
            Aged: Greasy, waxy, or slightly crusty. Heavily Aged: Hard, crusty, gummy, or tar-like. May contain embedded particulate
            matter, creating a rough surface. Can also be powdery if the oil has dried and oxidized.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 0.1 - 10 micrometers. Moderate buildup: 10 - 100 micrometers. Heavy buildup: 100 micrometers
            - 1 millimeter. Extreme buildup: > 1 millimeter (coin-thick or greater).'
          typical_formations: Drip marks, runs/streaks, pools/puddles, thin films, thick crusts, discrete patches, spots/dots,
            stains, and buildups are all common. The specific formation depends on the viscosity of the oil/grease, the surface
            orientation, and the environmental conditions. Thick crusts form from repeated exposure and oxidation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface roughness, temperature gradients, airflow, and the method of contamination. Gravity and surface tension
            play significant roles in creating non-uniform patterns.

      - black
      - brown
      - amber
      - dark gray
      texture: greasy, sticky, slippery

      appearance_on_materials:
        abs:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber or golden
            brown color. Aged contamination (months/years): Darkens to a dark brown or black color, thickens into a crusty
            or waxy layer, and becomes more matte. Oxidation products may create a rust-colored surface layer. The buildup
            becomes harder to remove.'
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours), then thickens
            and becomes more visible (days). It begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward. Accumulation
            often starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source
            expansion. Layering effects can occur with intermittent contamination. Seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#964B00). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to black (#000000). Oxidized areas: Rust-orange (#B7410E) may appear due to metallic additives.
            Areas with high ZDDP concentration may exhibit a slight greenish tint (#8FBC8F) in thin layers.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and corners, and a
            general accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Edges and areas around fasteners or joints tend to collect more buildup.
            Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are also frequently observed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas trap more oil/grease. Flat
            horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform, but potentially thicker, layer. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks
            and thinner coatings.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with visible
            buildup in crevices and edges (20-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating covering most of the surface (100-500
            μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer completely obscuring the original ABS surface (>500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on ABS typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging from light
            amber to dark brown or black. It often exhibits a sticky or tacky texture and tends to accumulate in low-lying
            areas or along edges. Coverage can vary from a thin film to a thick, crusty layer, depending on the duration and
            intensity of exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around leaks or lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (from splatters or drips), streaky/linear
            (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. It also concentrates in center areas if there is a central source of contamination (e.g.,
            a bearing). Uniform distribution is rare unless specifically applied as a coating. The perimeter is often more
            heavily contaminated than the immediate center of a flat surface.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges due to surface tension, follows contours, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to concentrate the buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. Hanging from overhead surfaces
            is possible but limited by viscosity and surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker colors and textures of aged buildup. Iridescence or rainbow effects may
            be visible in thin films due to interference, especially with fresh oil. Aged buildup tends to have a matte finish,
            reducing reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it oxidizes. Over time,
            it can harden into a crusty or waxy consistency. Close inspection may reveal a fine, granular texture due to the
            presence of solid additives and oxidation byproducts. The surface can be glossy when fresh, transitioning to matte
            as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more.
            Extremely aged buildup can reach thicknesses of several millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splatters), spots/dots (small drips), stains (penetration into ABS surface), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (localized accumulation), and no crystalline structures are expected.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The uniformity level is influenced by the application method, the geometry of the ABS surface,
            and the flow characteristics of the oil/grease. Gravity and air currents also play a role.
        acrylic (pmma):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light amber color.
            Aged contamination darkens significantly, becoming more opaque and viscous. The texture changes from smooth to
            sticky or crusty. Thickness increases substantially over time, often incorporating particulate matter.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, transparent film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens
            and becomes more visible, developing a light amber color. After weeks, the color darkens to yellow-brown, and
            the texture becomes sticky. Months of exposure lead to a thick, dark brown or black coating with a crusty or gummy
            texture. The buildup often begins at contact points or edges and then spreads outward. Layering effects can occur
            with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to pale yellow (#FAFAD2). Moderately aged: Yellow-brown
            (#A07A3D) to medium brown (#8B4513). Heavily aged: Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#000000) in extreme cases.
            Oxidation products can introduce reddish-brown hues (#B7410E). Sulfurized additives may create a greenish-brown
            tint (#556B2F).'
          common_patterns: Distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling
            in crevices and low-lying areas, and a thicker accumulation along edges and corners. Point source contamination
            results in radial spreading patterns. Streaks and runs are common on inclined surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces and crevices accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Exposed areas may experience some
            removal due to airflow or cleaning, leading to lower concentrations compared to sheltered areas. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to drip marks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often appearing as isolated spots or streaks.
            Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable film with a slight discoloration. Thickness: 5-15 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Visible coating with a distinct amber or yellow-brown color. Thickness: 15-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark
            brown coating with a sticky or tacky texture. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, almost black coating
            with a crusty or gummy texture. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on acrylic (PMMA) typically presents as a discolored, often sticky or
            tacky film, ranging from light amber to dark brown. The distribution is rarely uniform, exhibiting patterns influenced
            by gravity, surface geometry, and the source of contamination. Over time, the buildup can thicken and darken,
            becoming more viscous and attracting particulate matter.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action). 2) Point source spreading (radial pattern from the initial contact point). 3) Drip marks (vertical streaks
            caused by gravity). 4) Patchy/spotty distribution (uneven application or localized contamination). 5) Gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to flow towards the edges, creating a thicker deposit in these areas. This
            effect is particularly pronounced on smooth, non-porous surfaces like acrylic.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat
            areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges collect oil/grease due to surface
            tension. Depressions fill with the contaminant. The geometry dictates the flow paths and accumulation points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of the oil/grease, leading to a more uniform coating compared
            to vertical surfaces. Slopes exhibit runs, where the oil/grease flows downwards along the incline.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and thickens,
            the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Thicker deposits may exhibit slight iridescence due
            to thin-film interference, especially if the oil contains metallic additives. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends
            to highlight the discoloration and unevenness of the buildup.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            attracting dust and debris. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can develop a crusty or gummy texture. Microscopic
            examination may reveal a slightly granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific oil/grease composition
            and environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Initial film thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm.
            Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. Extreme cases can reach several millimeters, resembling a thick, hardened coating.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial contamination). 2) Drip marks (vertical
            streaks). 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation in low-lying areas). 4) Thick crusts (aged, oxidized oil/grease). 5)
            Discrete patches (localized contamination). 6) Stains (penetration into the acrylic surface, though less common
            than surface buildup). 7) Buildups (thick accumulations at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, the viscosity of the oil/grease,
            and the surface properties of the acrylic. Uneven surfaces and airflow patterns contribute to non-uniformity.
        alabaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, translucent film with a light amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) is thicker, darker (brown to black), and often has a crusty or hardened texture.
            It may also exhibit cracking or flaking due to repeated expansion and contraction with temperature changes. The
            aged buildup is significantly more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at
            contact points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation is faster in areas with higher exposure
            to the oil source. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, influencing the buildup rate.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination starts as a light amber (#F0C808) or pale yellow (#FFFFE0). As it oxidizes
            and ages, it transitions to a deeper amber (#D4A017), then to a brownish-orange (#A0785A), and eventually to a
            dark brown or even black (#000000) in heavily soiled areas. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown hue
            in some cases.
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools in horizontal depressions.
            It tends to accumulate along edges and in corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Splatter patterns
            may be present near the source of contamination. Fingerprints or wipe marks can also be visible.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom areas of vertical surfaces often have higher concentrations due to gravity-driven flow. Crevices and depressions
            act as collection points, leading to higher concentrations. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform,
            but potentially thicker, layers.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration,
            slight sheen, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct patches and streaks, matte finish, 20-100 μm thick. Heavy
            (60-85%): Significant discoloration, thick buildup in some areas, 100-500 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete
            coverage, thick crusty layer, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on alabaster results in a discoloration and alteration of the surface
            texture. Initially, it appears as a thin, translucent film, gradually darkening and thickening over time. The
            buildup tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, creating a mottled or streaked appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal
            depressions, edge accumulation due to surface tension, point source spreading from leaks or spills, and streaky/linear
            patterns from wiping or cleaning attempts. The most common patterns are edge accumulation and drip marks.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a darker and thicker band compared to the center
            areas. This is especially noticeable on flat surfaces with sharp edges.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to
            surface tension. It follows contours of the alabaster surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior, pooling
            at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, and vertical streaking. On horizontal surfaces, it promotes settling
            and even distribution. The flow rate depends on the viscosity of the oil and the surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            more oxidized, the surface becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting may highlight the yellow or amber tones
            of the oil. Heavily soiled areas may appear dull and opaque under any lighting conditions. Iridescence is not
            typically observed unless there is a very thin film of oil on a perfectly smooth surface.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface feels slightly oily or greasy to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and polymerizes,
            it becomes sticky and tacky. Over time, it can harden into a crusty or waxy layer. Dust and debris often adhere
            to the oily surface, creating a rough, textured finish. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous
            structure.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (micrometers) for fresh contamination to a heavy
            buildup of 0.1-1 mm (millimeters) or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several
            millimeters in thickness.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (splatter), stains (penetration into the alabaster), and buildups (accumulation over time).
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, exposure to the contaminant
            source, and cleaning efforts.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film, light brown in color, and relatively
            easy to wipe off. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (almost black), and more difficult
            to remove. It can harden into a crusty layer and may exhibit signs of thermal degradation, such as cracking or
            flaking.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film (1-5 μm) then thickens over time due to continued
            exposure and oxidation. It often begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) then spreads outward. Buildup
            can also start at edges and move inward. A uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure.
            Point sources expand outward in a radial pattern. Layering effects can occur with intermittent contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation. Timeframe: Hours
            - initial film formation; Days - noticeable thickening and darkening; Months - crusty buildup and hardening.'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), and eventually a near-black
            (#080808) with prolonged exposure and heat. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown hue (#4A442A) in
            some cases.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal crevices, and a
            general accumulation at the bottom of components due to gravity. Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are
            also frequently observed. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Bottom
            surfaces and crevices accumulate more due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to airflow and evaporation.
            Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with heavier concentrations at the bottom. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to
            have more uniform coverage, but with pooling in low spots.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often appearing as isolated spots or streaks
            (thickness < 5 μm). Light (10-30%): Patchy coverage with a thin, translucent film, easily wiped off (thickness
            5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coverage with a noticeable brown tint, slightly sticky to the touch
            (thickness 25-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark brown to black coating, difficult to remove, often crusty (thickness
            100-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, hardened layer, black in color, may exhibit cracking or flaking (thickness
            > 500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on alumina typically presents as a viscous, dark coating, ranging from
            a thin, barely visible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is generally dark brown to black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas
            due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), 2)
            Point source spreading (from leaks or lubrication points), 3) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with
            distance), 4) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized contamination), 5) Streaky/linear (from dripping
            or wiping), 6) Localized concentrations (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The liquid tends to minimize its surface area, leading to a higher concentration at the perimeter. This
            is especially noticeable in corners and along sharp edges. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform film,
            or be relatively clean if the contamination source is primarily at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            It collects at edges, following contours. It may bridge small gaps. Depressions fill with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            develop down slopes. Oil/grease may hang from overhead surfaces as droplets before dripping. The angle of the
            surface directly affects the flow rate and accumulation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte appearance of aged buildup. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes
            be observed in thin films due to interference, especially with fresh contamination. The aged buildup tends to
            be matte.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a smooth, slightly sticky film when fresh to a rough, crusty, and sometimes
            tacky surface when aged. It can feel greasy or waxy to the touch. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate
            matter embedded within the buildup, and in extreme cases, a hardened, almost varnish-like consistency.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or
            more in extreme cases. The average thickness in industrial settings is typically between 25-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (from fluid
            flow), 3) Pools/puddles (in horizontal crevices), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged
            buildup), 6) Discrete patches (localized contamination), 7) Spots/dots (splatter), 8) Stains (penetration into
            porous alumina), 9) Uniform coatings (rare, but possible with spray application). Drip marks and thin films are
            most common.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly
            uniform. The lack of uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, airflow patterns, and the method
            of contamination (e.g., splashing vs. dripping).
        aluminosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, transparent film with a slight sheen, light amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years): Thick, opaque, dark brown to black crust. The surface becomes dull, rough,
            and may exhibit cracking or flaking. The aged material is significantly harder and less soluble.'
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days).
            It often begins at contact points or edges and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with
            consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to pale yellow (#FFFFE0). Initial oxidation: Yellow-brown
            (#A07A44). Moderate oxidation: Medium brown (#8B4513) with rust-orange edges (#B7410E). Heavy oxidation: Dark
            brown to black (#000000) with possible iridescent sheen.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and corners, and a
            general accumulation along edges. Point source spreading is also common, especially around lubrication points
            or leaks. A gradient of thickness is often observed, with thicker deposits closer to the source.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Top surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing will have heavier deposits than sheltered areas. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Crevices and depressions act as collection points, leading
            to higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film,
            thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer,
            thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, thickness >100 μm, potentially reaching millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on aluminosilicate glass typically appears as a viscous, non-uniform
            coating ranging from a barely visible sheen to a thick, dark residue. The color is initially light amber, darkening
            to brown or black with age and oxidation. Coverage patterns vary from localized spots to extensive films, often
            influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension), point source spreading (common near lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (common with inconsistent application),
            streaky/linear (common on vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial
            patterns (around point sources).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The liquid tends to minimize its surface area, leading to a higher concentration at the perimeter. This
            is especially pronounced on smooth surfaces. The mechanism is the minimization of surface free energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            It collects at edges due to surface energy minimization. It follows contours and fills depressions. It can bridge
            small gaps due to its viscous nature.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles
            on horizontal surfaces. It runs down slopes. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually
            detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, although
            iridescent rainbow effects can sometimes be observed due to thin-film interference in areas with layered deposits.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as it oxidizes. With significant
            aging, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly crystalline due to the breakdown of additives and polymerization
            of hydrocarbons. Grain size is typically sub-micron, but larger agglomerates can form with age.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick' deposit could be
            2-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (also on vertical
            surfaces), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform
            coatings (rare), buildups (at edges/corners), and occasionally, crystalline structures (from additive breakdown).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, gravity, airflow, and the
            method of contamination. Areas with higher surface energy or lower airflow tend to accumulate more contamination.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time, it
            darkens and thickens due to oxidation, polymerization, and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Aged contamination
            becomes a hardened, opaque layer with a dark brown or black color. Thickness increases significantly, and the
            surface becomes rougher.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens over days due to continued
            application and oxidation. It often begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and then spreads outward.
            Edges tend to accumulate buildup faster than flat surfaces. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point
            source expansion. Layering effects can occur due to intermittent application or cleaning attempts. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light amber (#F0D58D) to honey-colored (#E4C063). Intermediate: Darker amber to light
            brown (#A67B5B). Aged: Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#222222), sometimes with a reddish-brown tint (#8B4513)
            due to oxidation products.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, forming drip marks, streaks, and pools. Edges, crevices, and areas
            with poor drainage tend to accumulate the most buildup. Flat horizontal surfaces collect more than vertical surfaces.
            Point source spreading is common around lubrication points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces. Top
            surfaces exposed to direct contamination sources tend to have heavier buildup than sheltered areas. Corners and
            areas with restricted airflow also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film with isolated spots. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            film with some streaks and spots, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage with visible buildup
            in crevices and edges, thickness 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with thick, dark layers, thickness
            50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement with very thick, crusty layers, thickness >200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on aluminum presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges from
            a thin sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically a gradient of browns and blacks, with coverage varying
            from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement. Texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to hardened
            and tacky when aged.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary action),
            point source spreading (around lubrication points), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pooling (on horizontal
            surfaces), and streaky/linear patterns (due to flow). The specific pattern depends on the application and environmental
            conditions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. It also concentrates in center areas around lubrication points. Uniform distribution is rare.
            The mechanism is driven by the surface energy of the aluminum and the cohesive forces within the oil/grease.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices and depressions,
            filling them over time. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It
            collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours due to capillary action. It can bridge small gaps
            due to its viscosity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces, forming thicker layers. It runs down slopes, creating streaks. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming
            droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy or oily sheen under direct lighting. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Under fluorescent lighting, the color appears less saturated.
            Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, slippery, and smooth to the touch. Intermediate: Tacky, sticky, and slightly viscous.
            Aged: Hardened, crusty, and sometimes brittle. May exhibit a slightly granular or crystalline structure at high
            magnification due to additive precipitation. Can feel rough due to accumulated particulate matter.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Runs/streaks form due to oil/grease flowing down
            inclined surfaces. Pools/puddles accumulate on horizontal surfaces. Thin films coat most surfaces initially. Thick
            crusts form over time due to oxidation and the accumulation of debris. Discrete patches and spots/dots appear
            around lubrication points. Stains are left behind after cleaning attempts.
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by differences in surface geometry, temperature gradients, airflow
            patterns, and the location of lubrication points. The presence of particulate matter also contributes to non-uniformity.
        aluminum bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy, dark brown film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (almost black), and more matte. It hardens into a crusty, sometimes cracked
            layer. Oxidation products may create a dull, powdery surface.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time as follows: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually
            (days). Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) then spreads outward (days/weeks). Starts at edges
            then moves inward (weeks/months). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in sheltered areas (months). Point sources
            expand outward, creating radial patterns (weeks/months). Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events
            (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A3A2A (Dark Chocolate), aging to #604630 (Coffee Bean), then #735437 (Russet
            Brown), and finally #333333 (Dark Gray) with oxidation. Heavily oxidized areas can exhibit a slight iridescent
            sheen.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            accumulation in crevices and corners, and localized spots around lubrication points. Edges and areas with restricted
            airflow tend to accumulate more buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and crevices tend to have heavier buildup due
            to capillary action and reduced airflow. Top surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing will have heavier concentrations
            than bottom surfaces. Corners accumulate more due to converging flow. Flat surfaces may have more uniform coverage.
            Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and thinner coatings. Sheltered areas accumulate more due to reduced cleaning
            action. The gradient patterns follow the direction of flow and accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick, appearing as a slight discoloration.
            Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, 5-10 μm thick, with visible streaks and spots. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous
            coating, 10-25 μm thick, with some areas of heavier buildup. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, 25-100 μm thick,
            obscuring the original surface in many areas. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, >100 μm thick, completely
            obscuring the original surface and potentially causing functional issues.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on aluminum bronze typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, hardened layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with
            a slightly tacky or sticky texture initially, becoming harder and more crusty with age. Coverage patterns vary
            from uniform films to localized accumulations, often concentrated in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary action), point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized
            wear), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners), and radial
            patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The liquid tends to spread along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners. The mechanism is driven by the
            minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Accumulates in corners due to converging
            flow. Builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and cleaning. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on
            vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours due to capillary
            action. Bridges gaps due to surface tension. Fills depressions due to gravity and capillary action. These effects
            are driven by fluid dynamics and surface energy.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases. The rate
            of downward flow depends on viscosity and temperature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the dark brown to black color more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish,
            with little to no reflection. Iridescence can occur in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and sticky, transitioning to a tacky, then a waxy feel. Over time,
            it hardens and becomes crusty, sometimes with a slightly granular or crystalline surface due to oxidation and
            polymerization of the hydrocarbons. The surface can be smooth when freshly applied, but becomes rough and uneven
            as it ages and accumulates debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. The average thickness in industrial settings is typically between 25-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter or small leaks), stains (penetrated into the metal surface),
            uniform coatings (sheltered areas), buildups (at edges and corners), and occasionally, crystalline structures
            (from certain additives). Formation mechanisms involve gravity, surface tension, evaporation, oxidation, and polymerization.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor
            variations is common on sheltered surfaces. Moderately patchy is typical in areas with varying exposure. Highly
            variable/irregular occurs near lubrication points or areas with high wear. Concentration is often higher in specific
            areas like edges and crevices. The uniformity level is influenced by application method, surface geometry, and
            environmental conditions.
        aluminum nitride:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, translucent film with a glossy sheen. Color is typically
            light amber. Aged contamination (months/years): Thick, opaque layer with a matte finish. Color darkens to dark
            brown or black. The surface becomes rougher and may exhibit cracking or flaking.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days). It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and move inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering effects occur with repeated
            contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#966F33). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to almost black (#222222) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from oxidation products.
            Heavily oxidized areas may show a dull grey (#808080) cast.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces due to gravity. On horizontal
            surfaces, it tends to pool and create uneven layers. Accumulation is often observed around edges, corners, and
            in any surface imperfections or scratches.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom surfaces and crevices accumulate more due to gravity and capillary action. Exposed areas may have less
            buildup due to evaporation or removal by airflow. Sheltered areas tend to have higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, translucent film with some pooling in crevices, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with visible streaks and pooling, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating with significant
            buildup in corners and crevices, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer covering most of
            the surface, thickness >100 μm, often exceeding 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Aluminum Nitride typically appears as a viscous, dark coating that
            ranges in color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly tacky or sticky texture. It tends to accumulate
            in crevices and low-lying areas, forming uneven layers and streaks.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping). Edge accumulation
            and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat surfaces. This is especially true for low surface
            energy materials like some polymers, but also applies to Aluminum Nitride, though to a lesser extent than polymers.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing
            sheltered areas. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges
            due to surface tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps if the viscosity is high enough. Fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible with high viscosity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen and may show slight iridescence
            due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the coating. Aged
            contamination has a matte finish and reflects less light.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages and oxidizes. With
            significant buildup, it can become crusty and hardened, exhibiting a slightly rough surface. Microscopic examination
            may reveal a non-uniform, amorphous structure with embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup:
            0.5-2 mm or more, depending on the source and duration of exposure.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into surface pores), uniform coatings
            (rare, intentional application), buildups (accumulation over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the contamination is intentionally applied as a coating. Non-uniformity arises from
            variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, and airflow patterns.
        ash:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): a thin, glossy film with a dark brown color. Aged contamination
            (months/years): a thick, matte crust with a black or very dark brown color. The aged material is often harder,
            less sticky, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Thickness increases significantly over time, and the surface
            becomes more irregular.'
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens at contact points
            and edges (days), spreads outward from contact points (days-weeks), forms drip marks on vertical surfaces (days),
            uniform gradual accumulation occurs with continuous exposure (weeks-months), point sources expand outward (weeks-months),
            layering effects occur with repeated contamination events (months-years), seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A3C30 (Dark Brown), Aged contamination: #211E1E (Black), Oxidized surface:
            #5C4033 (Burnt Umber), High-temperature degradation: #362F2E (Charcoal Gray), Thin film interference: slight iridescence
            (rainbow sheen).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices, and a general darkening
            of the ash surface. Accumulation is often more pronounced in areas with lower airflow or higher temperatures.
            Initial contamination often starts as localized spots that spread and coalesce over time.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and crevices tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension and capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Sheltered areas may have
            higher concentrations due to reduced evaporation. Vertical walls show drip marks with higher concentration at
            the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): scattered spots, barely visible film (1-10 μm). Light (10-30%): thin film,
            some visible discoloration (10-50 μm). Moderate (30-60%): patchy coating, noticeable darkening (50-150 μm). Heavy
            (60-85%): nearly complete coating, significant buildup (150-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): thick, crusty layer, obscuring
            the ash surface (>500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on ash presents as a dark, often multi-layered coating. The color ranges
            from dark brown to black, with a greasy or crusty texture depending on age and temperature. Coverage varies from
            sparse spotting to a thick, nearly complete coating, often concentrated in low-lying areas and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (initial contamination), streaky/linear (drip marks),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), radial patterns (around a central point of contamination).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker and thicker band. Center areas may
            have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially with spray application. Random distribution can occur with splatter
            or spills.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Accumulates in corners due to capillary action.
            Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces.
            Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the ash surface. Fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to ash's porous nature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Thin films
            may exhibit slight iridescence due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and sticky. Over time, it becomes crusty and hardened due to oxidation
            and polymerization. At high temperatures, it can become glassy or even carbonaceous. Microscopic examination reveals
            a heterogeneous mixture of amorphous and crystalline structures, with particle sizes ranging from sub-micrometer
            to several millimeters in aggregated clumps. Feels rough and uneven to the touch when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. Average thickness in moderate contamination scenarios is typically 50-200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous ash), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the method of contamination (e.g., spray vs. drip) and
            the surface geometry. Irregularities in the ash surface contribute to non-uniform distribution.
        bamboo:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often transparent or translucent. Over time
            (weeks to months), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more opaque. The surface transitions from glossy to matte
            as oxidation occurs. Aged buildup can develop a hard, crusty surface layer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or near sources of contamination.
            It then spreads outward, following the surface contours and accumulating at edges. Over time, the film thickens
            and darkens due to oxidation and the accumulation of more oil/grease. Layering effects may be visible in areas
            with repeated contamination. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and
            oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#FDD966) with a slight yellow tint'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B572A) with hints of orange'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#4E342E) almost black in thick areas'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-Brown (#A0522D) with a matte finish'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Oil/grease tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, along edges,
            and in the natural grooves and pores of the bamboo. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Areas near potential
            sources of contamination (e.g., machinery) exhibit higher concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and joints tend
            to accumulate more oil/grease. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, crusty buildup, completely covering the bamboo. Thickness: > 500 μm, up to several
                millimeters in localized areas.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating, obscuring the original bamboo surface. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with noticeable discoloration, some areas still clean. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant discoloration, most of the surface covered with a thin layer. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration. Thickness: < 5 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on bamboo presents as a darkening and discoloration of the surface, ranging
            from a subtle sheen to a thick, tacky coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown depending on age
            and oxidation. Accumulation often occurs in crevices and along edges, creating a visually uneven distribution.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (radial pattern from a leak), drip marks (vertical streaks), localized concentrations (around joints or fasteners),
            and patchy/spotty distribution (due to inconsistent application or cleaning). Edge accumulation and drip marks
            are particularly common on vertical bamboo structures.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, thicker band. This effect is more pronounced
            on sharp edges and corners. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil/grease
            from spreading further. Contours influence the flow and distribution patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate
            a thicker layer of oil/grease compared to vertical surfaces. Runs down slopes are also observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations and uneven distribution more clearly. Aged, oxidized buildup tends to have
            a matte finish, reducing reflectivity. Rainbow iridescence may be visible in very thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and tacky, eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy residue. Close inspection reveals a non-uniform surface
            with variations in gloss and roughness. The bamboo grain may be partially obscured by the buildup.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a few micrometers (5-10 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Localized accumulations can reach up to 5 mm in crevices.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks of varying thickness), runs/streaks
            (horizontal or angled flows), pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (uniform or non-uniform coverage), thick
            crusts (hardened, aged buildup), discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), and stains (discoloration
            of the bamboo itself).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, gravity, airflow, and the method
            of contamination. Areas with higher surface roughness or lower elevation tend to accumulate more oil/grease.
        basalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often with a slight iridescent sheen. Over
            time, the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darkening of color, increased viscosity, and eventual hardening
            into a crusty or tar-like deposit. Thickness increases with age and continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins at contact points (e.g.,
            leaks) and spreads outward. Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs
            on sheltered surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects may occur with
            intermittent contamination. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and
            oxidation (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #362F2E (Dark Charcoal Gray) with slight iridescence. Days old: #4A3C39
            (Dark Brown). Weeks old: #604E47 (Medium Brown). Months old: #735F56 (Olive Brown) with matte finish. Years old:
            #000000 (Black) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining from oxidation of metallic additives.'
          common_patterns: Initial accumulation occurs at edges, crevices, and low points due to capillary action and gravity.
            Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform coating. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Point
            sources of contamination lead to radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Bottom surfaces tend to accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas trap more contaminants.
            Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier concentrations at the bottom. Flat horizontal
            surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Lightly speckled appearance, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy coating, slight discoloration (5-15 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, distinct color change,
            some areas still visible (15-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, obscuring most of the original surface, dark
            color (50-150 μm). Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick, crusty deposit, significant alteration of surface
            appearance (>150 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on basalt presents as a dark, often iridescent or matte coating that
            varies in color from dark brown to black. The texture ranges from a thin, oily film to a thick, crusty deposit,
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced by
            surface geometry and gravity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces), edge accumulation
            (due to capillary action), point source spreading (around leaks or spills), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), streaky/linear (on vertical surfaces due to dripping), localized concentrations (in crevices and
            low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. The oil tends to wick along edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band. Center areas
            may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces. This effect is more pronounced on rough
            or porous surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to capillary
            action. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps between adjacent surfaces. Fills depressions and low points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top
            to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down
            slopes, creating streaks. Hanging droplets may form on overhead surfaces before dripping. Flow rate varies with
            viscosity and temperature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit an iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the matte finish of aged deposits. The sheen is more pronounced
            on smooth, freshly contaminated surfaces. Aged deposits are generally matte.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, smooth, slightly sticky. Days old: Tacky, slightly rough. Weeks old: Viscous, increasingly
            rough. Months old: Hardened, crusty, potentially brittle. Years old: Solid, often cracked, may exhibit a granular
            or layered structure. Touch feel varies from slick to abrasive.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm. Varies significantly based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches
            (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into porous areas), uniform coatings (on sheltered
            surfaces), buildups (at joints and seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare, occurring only on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces with consistent exposure. Mostly uniform with minor variations is common on flat surfaces. Moderately
            patchy is typical on complex geometries. Highly variable/irregular occurs in areas with inconsistent exposure
            or cleaning. Concentration is often concentrated in specific areas like crevices and edges.
        beech:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (weeks/months), it darkens, thickens,
            and becomes more viscous. Years of buildup can result in a hard, almost varnish-like coating that is difficult
            to remove. Color shifts from light amber to dark brown/black.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Begins at contact points
            (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation is faster in areas with high exposure to oil/grease.
            Over days/weeks, the film thickens and darkens. Over months/years, it can harden into a crusty layer. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated contamination events.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to yellowish-brown (#C4A484). Aged contamination:
            Dark brown (#8B4513) to reddish-brown (#A0522D). Heavily oxidized/burnt contamination: Blackish-brown (#3D3C3A)
            with possible iridescent sheen. Areas exposed to high heat may exhibit a burnt sienna (#E97451) hue.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, accumulation in crevices
            and joints, a general darkening of the wood surface in high-use areas. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
            A halo effect can occur around the initial point of contact.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration is typically found near lubrication points, in crevices and joints,
            and on horizontal surfaces where oil can pool. Lighter contamination is found on vertical surfaces and in areas
            that are regularly cleaned. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to surface tension effects.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            discoloration, thin film (5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Significant darkening, sticky or oily texture (25-100 μm).
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, potentially hardened (100-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup,
            significant alteration of the surface appearance (>500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on beech typically presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood
            surface, ranging from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film to
            a thick, sticky or hardened layer, depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns
            are often non-uniform, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication fittings), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splashing),
            streaky/linear (from drips or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices and joints). Edge accumulation is
            also frequently observed.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The oil tends to wick along the edges of the wood. This effect is more pronounced with fresh contamination. Center
            areas may show more uniform coverage if the oil was applied evenly.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and gravity. Pools on flat areas.
            Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the wood grain. Fills
            depressions and imperfections in the surface.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs
            at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads
            to thicker buildup over time. Runs down slopes, creating visible trails.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct light. Aged contamination tends
            to be more matte, although thick buildup can still reflect light. Under fluorescent lighting, the color may appear
            slightly cooler. Iridescence can occur in areas with very thin films or where oxidation products are present.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, slightly sticky. Aged: Tacky, gummy, may harden into a crusty or resinous
            texture. Heavily oxidized: Dry, brittle, potentially powdery or flaky. Close inspection may reveal a slightly
            uneven surface due to the wood grain interacting with the contaminant.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. Extreme buildup
            can reach several millimeters in localized areas.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks, runs/streaks, pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films, thick crusts (with
            age), discrete patches (from splashing), spots/dots (from aerosolized oil), stains (penetrating into the wood
            grain), buildups (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to the nature
            of industrial processes and the geometry of the equipment. Uniformity depends on the application method and the
            frequency of cleaning. Areas near lubrication points will be more heavily contaminated.
        beryllium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) darkens to a dark brown or black, becomes thicker and more viscous, and may develop
            a crusty or hardened surface. Oxidation products contribute to a dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or leak sources then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges then move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering effects can occur
            with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0D58D) with iridescent sheen. Initial oxidation: Yellowish-brown
            (#C49102). Moderate aging: Medium brown (#A67B5B). Heavy aging: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E) with reddish-brown
            undertones (#800000) in areas of extreme oxidation. Sulfurized additives may impart a greenish tint in some areas.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping, and accumulation in low-lying areas
            due to gravity. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface tension effects. Crevices and
            threaded areas act as traps for the oil/grease.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Bottom
            surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and threaded areas act as traps. Flat horizontal surfaces tend
            to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, iridescent film, barely visible, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage, slight discoloration, 5-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, visible
            buildup in some areas, 25-100 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, dark color, 100-500 μm thickness.
            Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, almost complete coverage, >500 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on beryllium typically presents as a non-uniform coating ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from light amber to dark brown, depending on
            the age and composition of the contaminant. Accumulation is often concentrated in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or application points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This
            is especially noticeable on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices and threaded areas, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces,
            collects at edges, and follows contours. Depressions fill with oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, but
            less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen and potential iridescence.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface texture. Aged contamination has
            a matte finish and reflects less light.
          texture_details: Texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to tacky and slightly rough as it ages. Heavily
            oxidized buildup can become crusty and hard. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or particulate structure
            due to the presence of wear debris and oxidation products. Feels sticky to the touch, especially when warm.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (iridescent sheen) to heavy buildup of 0.1-1 mm (visible
            crust). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized wear or leaks), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings
            (rare, usually intentional application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface finish, temperature gradients, airflow
            patterns, and the method of application or contamination.
        birch:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface loses its gloss and becomes dull or matte.
            Cracking and flaking may occur in extremely aged and thick deposits. The color shifts towards darker browns and
            blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate material first, then the contamination
            moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point source expansion. Layering effects occur
            with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#964B00). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to almost black (#000000) in heavily soiled areas. Oxidation products can introduce reddish-brown
            hues (#A52A2A). Areas with ZDDP may exhibit a slight greenish-brown tint.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, forming spots, streaks, and drip marks. Edges and crevices tend
            to accumulate more material. On horizontal surfaces, pooling can occur. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and
            runs. The pattern is rarely uniform, reflecting the dynamics of oil/grease deposition and flow.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces of horizontal areas may have lighter contamination due to dust accumulation. Bottom
            edges of vertical surfaces accumulate drips. Sheltered areas may have higher concentrations due to reduced evaporation
            and weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and stains, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, thicker
            film with some pooling in crevices (20-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, thick, glossy or matte
            coating (50-100 μm). Extreme (>85%): Complete surface coverage, thick, crusty buildup (100 μm+).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on birch presents as a darkening stain, ranging from light amber to dark
            brown, often with a slightly tacky or waxy texture. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface coating,
            depending on exposure and duration. The buildup tends to accentuate the wood grain and accumulate in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or spills), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pooling (on horizontal surfaces),
            and patchy/spotty coverage (due to uneven application or exposure). Gradient from source is also common, with
            decreasing concentration further from the source.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band.
            This effect is particularly noticeable on cut edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat
            areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act as barriers, causing buildup. Contours influence
            flow patterns. Depressions fill with oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces experience settling
            and pooling. Runs down slopes are observed. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets before they detach.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish. Under oblique lighting, surface irregularities and texture become more pronounced.
            The color appears richer and deeper under indoor fluorescent lighting compared to direct sunlight.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slightly tacky. Over time, oxidation and polymerization lead
            to a more waxy or even crusty texture, especially in areas with heavy buildup. The surface can feel smooth in
            thin films but rough and uneven in thicker deposits. The wood grain is often accentuated by the buildup.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extremely
            thick, aged deposits can reach several millimeters.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, heavy buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), and stains (penetration into the wood).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by the method of contamination (e.g., spraying vs. dripping), surface
            orientation, and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity).
        bismuth:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Colors
            are lighter (khaki to tan). Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more
            opaque. The texture transitions from oily to crusty, and the surface may develop cracks or fissures due to drying
            and oxidation. Thickness increases significantly.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progression typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks).
            It often begins at contact points (e.g., where oil drips) and then spreads outward. Buildup can also start at
            edges and move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward,
            creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations (temperature,
            humidity) can influence the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (khaki) to #D2B48C (tan). Initial oxidation: #A0522D (sienna). Moderate
            aging: #8B4513 (saddlebrown) with hints of #4A4A4A (dark grey). Heavy/aged: #000000 (black) with possible #2F4F4F
            (darkslategray) undertones.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. Uniform coatings
            are less common unless the bismuth surface is fully immersed or sprayed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces often have higher concentrations due to gravity-induced settling. Crevices and sheltered
            areas accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top (lighter) to
            bottom (heavier) due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.
            Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film with some visible color. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous
            film with noticeable color variations. Thickness: 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, opaque coating with significant
            buildup. Thickness: 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, encrusted layer with substantial buildup. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on bismuth typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tarry deposit. The color shifts from amber to dark brown/black as the
            contamination ages and oxidizes, often exhibiting a slightly uneven, textured surface. Coverage patterns vary
            from localized spots to extensive coatings, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or corners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there compared
            to the center areas. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            capillary action. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the bismuth surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less
            common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight iridescent sheen due to thin-film
            interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque nature of aged contamination.
            Gloss varies from high gloss (fresh) to matte (aged). Rainbow effects are possible with very thin films.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With further oxidation and polymerization, it transforms into a rough, crusty, and sometimes brittle solid. Microscopic
            examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific oil/grease composition and
            aging process.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 μm for a thin film to 0.5-5 mm for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer
            is approximately 50-100 μm. 'Coin-thick' would be >1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches
            (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coatings are rare unless specifically applied. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness,
            temperature gradients, airflow patterns, and the method of contamination.
        bluestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, oily film with a light brown color. Over time, it darkens
            and thickens due to oxidation, polymerization, and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Aged contamination can
            become a hard, black crust that is difficult to remove. The surface may also exhibit a matte finish as the oil
            degrades.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and darkens over days/weeks due to oxidation
            and the accumulation of dirt. It often begins at contact points or edges and spreads outwards. Over months/years,
            layering effects can occur, with older layers becoming hardened and newer layers remaining oily. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and degradation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light brown, almost transparent sheen (#A67B5B)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Darker brown with a hint of red (#8B4513)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#362F2D)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black with a possible greyish tint due to dust accumulation (#222222)'
          - 'Oxidized: Dark brown with a slight greenish hue due to copper corrosion products from brass fittings if present
            (#4A442A)'
          common_patterns: The oil/grease tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges. It often forms
            drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools on horizontal surfaces. Initial contamination often starts at points
            of contact with machinery or leaking components.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Top surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Corners and
            joints tend to accumulate more buildup than flat surfaces. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due
            to gravity.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Almost complete coverage with a very thick, crusty layer of oil/grease. The bluestone color is
                barely visible or completely hidden.
              thickness: '>1 mm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Extensive coverage with a thick layer of oil/grease. The bluestone color is largely obscured.
              thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: A noticeable film with some discoloration. The bluestone color is still visible through the oil/grease.
              thickness: 1-10 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Significant discoloration with a visible buildup of oil/grease. The bluestone color is partially
                obscured.
              thickness: 10-100 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. The bluestone color is still dominant.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on bluestone manifests as a darkening and discoloration of the surface,
            ranging from subtle sheens to thick, crusty deposits. The color is typically dark brown to black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. The buildup often follows the natural texture of the
            bluestone, accentuating its irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (along joints and borders), point
            source spreading (radiating outwards from a leak), drip marks (vertical streaks), pooling (in depressions), and
            patchy/spotty distribution (due to uneven application or splashing). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are the most prevalent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This
            is due to capillary action, surface tension effects, and the tendency for contaminants to be trapped at boundaries.
            The center areas of flat surfaces tend to have thinner, more uniform coatings.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading further.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            The angle of the surface directly affects the rate and direction of flow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker areas of buildup. Heavily contaminated areas may appear matte due to the
            accumulation of dirt and oxidation products. Iridescence can occur in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. Heavily built-up
            areas can become crusty and hard, sometimes exhibiting a slight granular texture due to the presence of particulate
            matter. The surface can feel slightly rough due to embedded dirt and debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Crusty deposits can reach thicknesses of up to 10 mm in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (due to gravity), pools/puddles
            (in depressions), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (splashes),
            and stains (penetration into the bluestone).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, exposure to contaminants, and the effects of gravity
            and weathering.
        boron carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a thin, oily film, light brown in color. Aged contamination
            (months/years) is a thick, hard, dark brown to black crust. The surface becomes dull and matte, and the buildup
            may crack or flake off. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins
            at contact points (e.g., drip locations) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward, although this
            is less pronounced on perfectly flat surfaces. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), eventually becoming
            almost black (#000000) with a hint of reddish-brown (#800000) in heavily oxidized areas.
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges. Initial
            contamination may appear as localized spots or streaks, which then spread and coalesce over time. Drip marks are
            common on vertical surfaces. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Sheltered areas may have heavier buildup than
            exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible, <5 μm thick. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film, patchy distribution, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, uneven distribution, 25-100
            μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, significant buildup, 100-500 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Near-complete
            encasement, very thick crust, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Boron Carbide typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with
            a semi-glossy to matte finish depending on the age and oxidation level. Coverage varies from localized spots to
            near-complete surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (flow patterns), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners).
            Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to 'wick' towards the edges. While the center can also accumulate buildup,
            the edges typically show a higher concentration, especially in the initial stages of contamination.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. It accumulates in corners due to capillary
            action. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker layers. It
            drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, forming a bead-like appearance. It follows
            contours, conforming to the surface shape.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker layers. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces
            is possible, but less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            matte, the sheen disappears. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Heavily oxidized
            areas may exhibit a slight iridescence due to thin-film interference, but this is rare.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry. With
            age and oxidation, it becomes hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or amorphous structure. It feels greasy initially, then rough and uneven as it hardens.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A moderate layer is typically in the range of 25-250 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (flow patterns), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (uneven
            application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into surface pores), uniform coatings (rare, but possible
            with controlled application), buildups (localized accumulations).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. It's rarely perfectly
            uniform. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, flow patterns,
            and the location of contamination sources.
        boron nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) darkens to a dark brown or black color, thickens significantly, and becomes
            hard and crusty. Cracking and flaking may occur in severely aged deposits. The surface finish transitions from
            glossy to matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins
            at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point
            sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated applications or spills. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (Khaki), resembling a light varnish. Initial oxidation: #D2B48C
            (Tan) with a slight yellow tint. Moderate buildup: #A0785A (Coffee Brown) with reddish undertones. Aged/Heavily
            oxidized: #4A3C30 (Dark Chocolate Brown) with possible blackening due to carbonization. Extreme aging: #221F1F
            (Charcoal) with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It accumulates
            in corners, crevices, and around bolt holes. Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform coating, although often
            with variations in thickness. Point sources of contamination lead to radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Bottom
            surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low spots act as collection points. Exposed areas may experience
            more rapid oxidation and buildup due to increased airflow and temperature variations. Vertical walls exhibit drip
            marks and streaks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often only detectable by touch. Thickness:
            <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Visible film with slight discoloration. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with distinct color change. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant
            buildup. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer with potential for flaking. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Boron Nitride typically presents as a discolored film, ranging from
            light amber to dark brown, often with a slightly tacky or waxy texture. The distribution is rarely uniform, tending
            to accumulate in crevices and along edges, forming streaks and localized deposits. Over time, oxidation and thermal
            degradation can lead to a hardened, crusty appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only on carefully prepared
            surfaces), edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension and capillary action), point source spreading
            (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to
            inconsistent application or localized leaks), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations
            (in low spots or crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This effect is particularly pronounced on sharp edges and corners. Uniform distribution is rare unless the surface
            is meticulously prepared and the oil is applied evenly.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges due to surface tension, follows contours, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to have higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down
            slopes are observed. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the color variations more clearly. Heavily oxidized deposits tend to have a matte finish, absorbing light
            rather than reflecting it. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with very thin films.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and slightly oily to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and polymerizes,
            it becomes sticky and tacky. With prolonged exposure to heat and contaminants, it hardens into a waxy or crusty
            layer. At high magnification, a fine granular or amorphous structure may be visible. The surface can range from
            glossy when fresh to matte when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.5-3
            mm) for heavy buildup. A light coating might be 10-50 μm, while a moderate buildup could be 100-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low spots), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches
            (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare), buildups
            (at joints and seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is extremely rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil/grease application.
        borosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, transparent or light amber film. Aged
            contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The texture evolves from oily to sticky,
            then to crusty or even hardened. Oxidation can lead to rust-colored deposits.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin, transparent film (hours). It then thickens and becomes
            more opaque (days). Over time (weeks/months), it can harden and form a crust. Buildup often begins at contact
            points or edges and then spreads inward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light amber (#F5DEB3), almost transparent. Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484). Moderately
            Aged: Medium brown (#A0785A). Heavily Aged: Dark brown (#654321) with possible black (#000000) deposits from carbonization.
            Oxidized: Rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges may appear.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. Uniform coatings
            are rare unless the glass is submerged or sprayed with the contaminant.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier near the source of contamination. Edges and corners
            often accumulate more buildup due to surface tension effects. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks with higher concentration
            at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces may have more uniform but thicker deposits. Sheltered areas may accumulate
            more dust and debris within the oil/grease.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable film,
            slight discoloration, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Opaque film, distinct color, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, dark, and potentially crusty layer, 50-200 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, heavily encrusted, and
            potentially obscuring the glass surface, >200 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on borosilicate glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film,
            ranging in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky
            or even crusty with age. Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced by gravity, surface geometry, and the
            source of contamination.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually from submersion).
            2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (radial pattern). 4) Gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (uneven deposition). 6) Streaky/linear
            (from drips or wiping). 7) Localized concentrations (in crevices or corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to spread along the perimeter of the glass before covering the central
            areas. This is especially noticeable with small droplets or spills.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. Flat areas allow for pooling. Vertical surfaces result in drips. Edges collect oil/grease
            due to capillary action. Contours guide the flow of the contaminant. Depressions fill with oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces experience settling. Slopes exhibit
            runs. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting can highlight the color variations and thickness of the buildup. Heavily oxidized or carbonized deposits
            may appear matte. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, and slippery to the touch. Slightly Aged: Sticky, tacky, and leaves a residue.
            Moderately Aged: Viscous, gummy, and may attract dust and debris. Heavily Aged: Hard, crusty, and may exhibit
            a slight tackiness. Oxidized: Can become powdery or flaky.'
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or
            even exceeding 1 mm in extreme cases. The thickness varies significantly depending on the duration and intensity
            of exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks). 2) Runs/streaks (from gravity).
            3) Pools/puddles (in low-lying areas). 4) Thin films (initial contamination). 5) Thick crusts (aged buildup).
            6) Discrete patches (uneven deposition). 7) Spots/dots (splatter). 8) Stains (penetration into the glass surface,
            rare). 9) Buildups (localized accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coatings are rare. The level of uniformity is influenced by the method of contamination, surface geometry, and
            environmental factors. Areas near the source of contamination will be more concentrated.
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often barely visible. Over time (weeks/months),
            it darkens, thickens, and becomes more matte. Aged contamination (years) can be a hard, crusty, black layer, often
            mixed with dust and debris. The surface underneath may show signs of corrosion (greenish or reddish discoloration).
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points or lubrication points and spreads outward. Accumulation starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated applications
            or contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#FFBF00 to #FFD700), almost invisible'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Light brown (#A07A55), noticeable sheen'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#8B4513), matte finish'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black (#301900 to #000000), often with a crusty appearance'
          - 'Oxidized: Dark reddish-brown (#800000) due to brass corrosion products mixed in'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coatings on flat surfaces, accumulation in corners and crevices,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, and localized spots around lubrication points. Edges and areas with restricted
            airflow tend to accumulate more buildup. Streaks are common where oil has run down surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas collect more debris
            and buildup. Flat horizontal surfaces can have uniform layers, while vertical walls exhibit drip marks. Exposed
            areas may have less buildup due to washing or wiping.

                certain lighting.'
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on brass typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is initially a translucent amber, darkening
            over time to shades of brown and black. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to localized accumulations in
            crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually only with fresh application),
            edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (due to flow), localized concentrations (in crevices), radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center.
            This is especially pronounced in corners and along seams. The center may have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges due to surface tension, follows contours, bridges gaps, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to have
            thicker accumulations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to viscosity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Aged, matte buildup diffuses light, appearing dull. Iridescence
            or rainbow effects can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and then tacky as it ages. With further
            aging and oxidation, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly brittle. Close inspection may reveal a fine,
            granular texture due to the presence of wear debris and oxidation products. Feels greasy initially, then becomes
            more like hardened varnish.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5
            mm) for heavy buildup. Extremely aged deposits can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in sheltered areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial layer), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (localized accumulations), no crystalline structures typically.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare except immediately after application. Variations are caused by gravity, surface geometry,
            temperature gradients, airflow patterns, and the nature of the application method.
        breccia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a thin, oily film, often transparent or translucent with a
            slight amber color. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more opaque. The surface becomes
            harder and less tacky, often developing a crusty or cracked appearance. Oxidation products contribute to a darker,
            more matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., where oil drips) and spreads outward. Accumulation starts at edges and crevices, then gradually
            covers flat surfaces. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a thin, iridescent film with a slight amber tint (#D4A373).
            As it ages, it darkens to a burnt umber (#8A3324) or dark brown (#654321). Heavily oxidized and aged deposits
            can appear almost black (#000000) with rust-orange (#B7410E) edges due to iron oxide formation from corrosion.
            Sulfurized additives can create a greenish-black sheen in some areas.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots and streaks, particularly on vertical surfaces where gravity
            causes the oil to run. Accumulation is often observed in crevices and along edges, where the oil is trapped. On
            horizontal surfaces, pooling can occur, leading to thicker deposits in low-lying areas. Drip marks are prevalent
            on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            gravity. Top surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing will have higher concentrations than bottom surfaces. Corners
            and sheltered areas may accumulate more oil due to reduced cleaning action. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient
            from top to bottom due to gravity-induced flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often iridescent, <5 μm thick. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage, visible discoloration, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, noticeable
            buildup in crevices, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, obscuring the original surface, 100-500
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, completely obscuring the original surface, >500 μm thick,
            potentially several millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on breccia presents as a complex, multi-layered coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent sheen to a thick, dark, and sticky crust. The color is typically dark brown to black, with
            variations depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced
            by the breccia's rough surface and porosity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (common), point source spreading
            (around leaks), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven surface),
            streaky/linear (from drips), localized concentrations (in crevices). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges of the breccia fragments, creating a darker, more
            concentrated band. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, or remain relatively clean depending
            on the exposure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Oil collects at edges
            due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions. The rougher the surface, the more localized
            the accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Oil runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead
            surfaces is possible with very viscous or tacky contaminants. Drip marks can extend several centimeters or even
            meters depending on the source and viscosity.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a sheen or gloss, reflecting light. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte appearance of aged deposits. Iridescence can be observed in thin
            films due to light interference. Heavily oxidized areas may appear dull and non-reflective.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a smooth, oily film when fresh to a sticky, tacky surface as it begins
            to oxidize. Over time, it can become a hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle deposit. Close inspection may reveal
            a fine granular or crystalline structure, especially in areas with high ZDDP concentration. The surface can be
            rough and uneven due to the breccia's inherent texture and the uneven buildup of contaminants.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 10 mm or more in areas with prolonged exposure and limited
            cleaning.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (uneven surfaces), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare,
            only with controlled application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. The rough surface
            of breccia and variations in exposure to the contaminant contribute to the non-uniformity. Areas with direct contact
            to the oil source will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas.
        brick:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a wet, glossy stain that darkens the brick. Aged contamination becomes
            duller, thicker, and more opaque. The color shifts from dark brown to black. Cracking and flaking may occur in
            heavily contaminated areas. The surface becomes harder and less tacky.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points (e.g., near a leak). It then
            spreads outward, following the brick's surface texture. Accumulation often begins at edges and crevices, then
            moves inward. The process is a uniform gradual accumulation. Layering effects can occur with repeated spills or
            leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening. Within hours, a thin
            film is visible. Within days, the film thickens and becomes tacky. Within months, the oil hardens and darkens.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #362F2E (Dark Charcoal Gray) with a slight sheen. Days old: #4A4443 (Dark
            Slate Gray) with a matte finish. Weeks old: #605349 (Dark Olive Brown) with a slight tackiness. Months old: #463E3A
            (Dark Coffee Brown) with a hardened surface. Years old: #282320 (Black) with a cracked, crusty texture.'
          common_patterns: The buildup typically starts as localized spots or streaks near the source of the oil leak or spill.
            It then spreads outward, following the brick's surface texture and gravity. Accumulation is common in crevices,
            mortar joints, and low-lying areas. Drip marks and runs are often visible on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier near the source of the contamination and in low-lying
            areas where oil can pool. Edges and corners often accumulate more oil due to surface tension effects. Vertical
            walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas may accumulate more oil due to reduced
            evaporation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): faint staining, barely noticeable, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): visible
            discoloration, slight darkening, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable staining, dark brown color, thickness
            5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): significant darkening, thick coating, thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): almost complete
            coverage, black color, thick crust, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on brick presents as a darkening and discoloration of the brick surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to thick, glossy coatings. The color is typically dark brown or black, with variations
            depending on the oil type and age. The texture ranges from smooth and oily to hardened and crusty, often accumulating
            in crevices and low points.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), streaky/linear (following flow paths), localized
            concentrations (in crevices and low spots), and patchy/spotty (uneven coverage due to surface irregularities).
            Point source spreading and gradient from source are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is
            due to surface tension effects, which cause the oil to be drawn to the edges of the brick and into the mortar
            joints. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, but the edges will exhibit a darker, more concentrated
            buildup.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools
            on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a
            darker outline. It follows contours, highlighting the brick's texture. It bridges small gaps and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Oil pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur
            down slopes. Oil can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip down.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the darker color and texture variations more clearly. Aged deposits tend to have a matte finish,
            reflecting less light. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects, especially with
            certain additives.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch, with a viscosity similar to heavy machine
            oil. Over time, oxidation and polymerization cause the oil to become sticky and tacky. Eventually, it hardens
            into a crusty, brittle layer. Close inspection reveals a fine, granular texture, especially in aged deposits.
            The surface can be slightly rough due to embedded dirt and debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extremely aged deposits can reach thicknesses of 5 mm or more in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (following surface
            contours), pools/puddles (in low spots), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (uneven coverage), spots/dots (splatter), stains (absorbed into the brick), and buildups (accumulations
            in crevices). Drip marks, runs/streaks, and thin films are the most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by the uneven surface of the brick, the direction of oil flow, and
            the presence of obstacles. The porosity of the brick also contributes to non-uniform absorption.
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. As it ages, the oil darkens and thickens, becoming
            more viscous and attracting dirt. After months or years, the buildup can harden into a crusty, almost tar-like
            substance. The color shifts from amber to dark brown or black, and the surface becomes dull and matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens over days, especially
            at contact points and edges. Over weeks, the oil spreads and accumulates in crevices. After months, the buildup
            hardens and darkens, forming a crusty layer. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect the viscosity of the
            oil and the rate of accumulation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber, similar to #D4A373 (light bronze)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Dark amber, #8C643A (darker bronze)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Brownish-black, #362F2E (dark brown)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black, #000000 (black)'
          - 'Oxidized: May exhibit iridescent sheen with hints of #4F7942 (hunter green) due to copper oxidation within the
            oil layer'
          common_patterns: The buildup tends to accumulate in areas where oil can pool or where there is direct contact with
            machinery. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and corners, and a general
            darkening of surfaces exposed to the oil source. Edges and seams often show the heaviest accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices where oil can accumulate.
            Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Sheltered areas often have thicker deposits
            than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action from wind or rain. Vertical walls show a gradient from top (source)
            to bottom (pooling).
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:

            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible, isolated spots or streaks. Thickness: <1 μm.'
              visual: Slight discoloration, faint sheen in some areas.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on bronze typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that obscures
            the original bronze luster. The color ranges from dark amber to almost black, depending on age and composition.
            The texture is generally sticky and uneven, often accumulating in crevices and low-lying areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (oil wicks to edges due to surface
            tension), point source spreading (oil radiates from a leak), drip marks (vertical streaks from a source above),
            localized concentrations (pooling in low spots), and uniform coating (from splashing or immersion). The most common
            patterns are edge accumulation and point source spreading.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker deposit along the perimeter. This is driven by the
            minimization of surface energy at the oil-air-bronze interface.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas
            allow oil to pool. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges collect oil due to wicking. Depressions fill with
            oil. These effects are driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. The rate
            of flow depends on the oil's viscosity and the surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen. As it ages and becomes coated
            with dirt, the surface becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the buildup,
            creating shadows and variations in color intensity. Heavily oxidized areas may show iridescence.
          texture_details: Initially, the oil/grease is smooth and sticky to the touch. Over time, it becomes tacky and may
            harden slightly due to oxidation and polymerization. Dust and debris adhere readily, creating a rough, uneven
            surface. At high magnification (SEM), the surface may show micro-cracking and a layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled streaks), pools/puddles
            (accumulations in low spots), thin films (initial coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (isolated
            spots), stains (discoloration of the bronze), and buildups (general accumulation). Drip marks and thin films are
            most common initially, progressing to crusts over time.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the bronze component was fully submerged in oil. The non-uniformity is caused by variations
            in surface geometry, oil flow patterns, and the presence of dust and debris.
        calcite:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a thin, oily film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years): Darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous or even solid. Oxidation
            products contribute to a reddish-brown or black color. The surface may develop cracks and a rough texture.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., drip locations) then spreads outward. Accumulation can also start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur
            with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0D587) to honey-colored (#E4B96F). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#3B3228) to black (#000000). Oxidized areas: Rust-orange (#B7410E) to reddish-brown (#A0522D). Areas with
            high ZDDP content may exhibit a slight greenish-brown tint.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in horizontal depressions, and
            accumulates along edges and in crevices. Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks, which
            then spread and coalesce over time. Areas exposed to higher temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces often exhibit heavier buildup due to gravity-induced flow.
            Corners and sheltered areas accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate
            pools of oil/grease.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: 1-10
            μm. Light (10-30%): Thin film with noticeable discoloration. Thickness: 10-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Partial coating
            with visible buildup in some areas. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coating with thick deposits.
            Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete coverage with very thick, crusty buildup. Thickness: >500
            μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on calcite presents as a discolored, often sticky or hardened layer,
            ranging from light staining to thick crusts. The color is typically brown or black, with variations depending
            on the oil's composition and age. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, forming drip marks and
            pools.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (flow along surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices or
            low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to spread along the perimeter of the calcite surface, creating a darker outline. This is
            because the surface energy is lower at the edge, making it energetically favorable for the oil/grease to adhere
            there. Center areas may have thinner or less concentrated deposits.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices due to capillary
            action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges
            due to surface tension. It follows contours due to surface tension and gravity. It bridges gaps due to surface
            tension. It fills depressions due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior on vertical and sloped surfaces. This results in pooling
            at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence.
            Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, forming pools or puddles. Runs down slopes are also common. The rate
            of flow depends on the viscosity of the oil/grease and the surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish. Thicker deposits may show some iridescence due to thin-film interference, especially
            if layered. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making color variations less pronounced.
          texture_details: Fresh oil/grease is typically sticky and viscous. As it ages and oxidizes, it can become tacky,
            rubbery, or even hard and crusty. The surface can range from smooth and glossy when wet to rough and matte when
            dry. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. Typical buildup in industrial settings ranges from 25-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into calcite), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (accumulation over time). Drip marks, pools, and thin films are most common.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations can occur with spray applications. Moderately patchy distribution is common due to uneven
            application or localized contamination sources. Highly variable/irregular distribution is typical in areas with
            complex geometry or varying exposure to contaminants. The uniformity level is primarily determined by the application
            method and the surface's geometry.
        carbon fiber reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, translucent film, often with a slight sheen. Over time,
            it darkens and thickens, becoming more opaque and less reflective. Aged deposits are often harder and more difficult
            to remove, exhibiting a dull, matte finish. The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks as oxidation progresses.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and move inward,
            or vice versa depending on the source. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point sources that expand
            outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (khaki) to #DEB887 (burly wood). Partially oxidized: #A0522D (sienna)
            to #8B4513 (saddle brown). Heavily oxidized/aged: #654321 (dark brown) to #000000 (black). Sulfurized additives
            can impart a greenish-brown hue in some cases, approximately #556B2F (dark olive green).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, with a tendency to form streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces.
            Edges and crevices act as collection points, leading to thicker deposits in these areas. Flat surfaces may exhibit
            a more uniform coating, but often with variations in thickness.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces and low points accumulate more due to gravity. Exposed areas may experience
            some removal due to airflow or cleaning, while sheltered areas retain more buildup. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient
            from top to bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (5-10 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, translucent film with some visible buildup at edges (10-50 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Opaque coating with noticeable
            thickness variations (50-150 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating obscuring much of the underlying surface
            (150-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup completely obscuring the surface (500 μm - 3 mm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on CFRP typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that obscures the
            underlying carbon fiber weave. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on age and composition,
            and the texture can vary from a thin, oily film to a thick, tacky residue. Coverage is often uneven, concentrating
            in low points and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The perimeter of a contaminated area will often have a thicker, more defined line of buildup compared
            to the center. This is especially true for viscous greases.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension, builds up in crevices due to capillary action, pools on flat areas due to gravity, drips on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity, collects at edges due to surface tension, follows contours due to adhesion, bridges gaps
            due to viscosity, and fills depressions due to gravity and surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces, often forming droplets that eventually
            detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or oily rainbow effect due
            to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of buildup.
            Aged deposits typically have a matte finish and appear less reflective under all lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, becoming increasingly sticky and tacky as oxidation
            occurs. Over time, a crusty or gummy surface may develop, especially with exposure to heat and air. Microscopic
            examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. Feels slick when fresh, increasingly
            tacky and resistant to wiping as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-20 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.5-3
            mm) for heavy buildup in localized areas. Average thickness on flat surfaces is typically in the range of 25-250
            μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial coating), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter or small leaks), stains (penetration into the CFRP matrix), and buildups
            (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, gravity-induced flow, surface irregularities, and localized
            sources of contamination.
        carbon steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, oily film, often with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. The texture changes from smooth to sticky, then to a
            hardened crust. Thickness increases with age, and corrosion products (rust) may become visible underneath or mixed
            within the buildup.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film. It then thickens over time due to continuous
            deposition and oxidation. The process often begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads
            outward. Edges tend to accumulate oil/grease faster than the center. Layering effects can occur, with new oil/grease
            deposited on top of older, hardened layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate
            of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes: Hours (initial film), Days (visible buildup), Months (thickening and darkening),
            Years (hardened crust).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with light amber tones (#F0C808)'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Dark amber to light brown (#A07A55)'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to black (#33292F) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) bleed-through from underlying
            steel corrosion.'
          - 'Extreme Buildup (years): Black, often with a matte finish and a tar-like appearance (#000000)'
          common_patterns: Distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling
            in low-lying areas, and accumulation along edges and crevices. Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are also
            frequently observed. Areas near lubrication points or leaks exhibit the heaviest concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            gravity. The bottom of vertical surfaces tends to have more buildup due to dripping. Sheltered areas accumulate
            more oil/grease than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning by rain or wind. Corners and joints are prime locations
            for accumulation.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete coverage with a very thick, often hardened layer. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              visual: Steel surface completely covered by a thick, dark, and often crusty layer of oil/grease. The underlying
                metal is not visible.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Nearly complete coverage with a thick, viscous layer. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual: Steel surface almost entirely obscured by a thick layer of oil/grease. The underlying metal is difficult
                to see.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film with some visible areas of clean steel. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual: Steel surface with a thin, uneven coating of oil/grease, allowing the underlying metal to be easily
                seen.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'More continuous film, but still with some uncovered areas. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual: Steel surface largely covered with oil/grease, but with some patches of clean metal or thinner coating.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual: Mostly clean steel with a few scattered droplets or faint streaks.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on carbon steel presents as a viscous coating, ranging from a thin, iridescent
            sheen to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the oil's age, composition,
            and environmental conditions, often exhibiting a sticky or tacky texture. Coverage patterns are typically non-uniform,
            influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), 2) Point source spreading (around lubrication fittings or leaks), 3) Gradient from source (decreasing
            thickness with distance from the source), 4) Patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent application or removal), 5) Streaky/linear
            (from dripping or wiping), 6) Localized concentrations (in crevices or corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there compared to the center. This effect is more
            pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due
            to surface tension. It follows contours, creating patterns that mimic the surface shape. It can bridge small gaps
            and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Oil/grease runs down slopes, creating a
            gradient of thickness. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil exhibits a glossy or reflective surface, especially under direct light. As it ages and
            becomes contaminated, the surface becomes more matte. Iridescence can be observed in thin films due to interference
            effects. Under direct sunlight, aged buildup may appear less reflective and more dull. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the darker tones and textures.
          texture_details: Fresh oil is smooth and slippery. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and tacky. Heavy buildup
            can form a crusty, hardened layer. Depending on the presence of wear debris (metal particles), the surface can
            feel gritty or abrasive. The texture ranges from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, pliable or brittle
            coating.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm, or even thicker in extreme cases) for heavy, aged buildup. Typical range: 5 μm to 2 mm.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks), 2) Runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            3) Pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged, hardened
            buildup), 6) Discrete patches (localized spills or leaks), 7) Spots/dots (splatter from rotating equipment), 8)
            Stains (penetration into porous surfaces), 9) Buildups (layered accumulation over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely uniform due to factors such as gravity,
            surface geometry, application method, and environmental conditions. Uniformity is more likely on surfaces that
            are regularly cleaned or lubricated, but even then, variations are common.
        cast iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber or brown color. Over
            time (weeks to months), it darkens and thickens due to oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. Aged
            contamination is often black, crusty, and may exhibit signs of cracking or flaking. The surface becomes less glossy
            and more matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days due to continued exposure and
            oxidation. It often begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation starts
            at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point source expansion or layering
            effects. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: #D2B48C (Tan) to #A07A55 (Sienna). Moderately Aged: #8B4513 (Saddle Brown) with hints
            of #B8860B (Dark Goldenrod) where thin. Heavily Aged: #221F1F (Almost Black) with possible #B7410E (Burnt Sienna)
            rust bleed-through from the cast iron itself.'
          common_patterns: The buildup is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and around
            edges. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Areas exposed to direct abrasion or cleaning may have significantly
            less buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces tend to accumulate more due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also exhibit
            higher concentrations. Flat surfaces may have a more even, but still variable, coating. Vertical walls show drip
            marks and streaks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible accumulation in crevices. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with distinct color variations. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant
            buildup. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer obscuring the original surface. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cast iron presents as a dark, often glossy or semi-glossy coating
            that varies in color from amber to dark brown or black depending on age and composition. It typically accumulates
            in crevices and low-lying areas, forming a sticky or crusty layer.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent application or cleaning), streaky/linear (from drips or runs), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low spots).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas.
            This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, forming thicker layers.
            It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming beads or rims. It follows contours,
            creating patterns that mirror the surface shape. It bridges gaps, forming thin films across openings.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces, forming thicker layers. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, but
            less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, more matte appearance of aged buildup. Iridescence or rainbow effects
            are possible in very thin films due to interference, but are not common in heavy buildup.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or waxy solid. Close inspection may reveal a slightly granular or layered structure,
            especially in areas of heavy buildup. The surface can range from glossy to matte depending on the degree of oxidation
            and the presence of particulate matter.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. Extreme buildup
            can reach several millimeters in thick, crusty layers.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into porous areas), uniform coatings
            (rare, usually from intentional application), buildups (accumulations in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, gravity, temperature gradients, and the method
            of application or contamination.
        cedar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is characterized by a light color, a wet or oily appearance,
            and a relatively thin film. Aged contamination (months/years old) is darker, thicker, and often has a dry, crusty
            texture. The color deepens significantly, and the buildup can become quite hard and difficult to remove. Oxidation
            products contribute to a dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses over time as follows: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually
            (days). Begins at contact points (e.g., drips, splashes) then spreads outward (days/weeks). Starts at edges and
            corners then moves inward (weeks/months). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on horizontal surfaces (months/years).
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns (weeks/months). Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination appears as a light amber (#F0C27B) or honey-colored stain. As it ages and
            oxidizes, it transitions to a medium brown (#A67B5B), then a dark brown (#654321). Heavily contaminated areas
            can appear almost black (#000000) due to the accumulation of oxidation products and particulate matter. Sulfurized
            additives can impart a greenish-brown tint in some cases (#808000).
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and corners, and a
            general darkening of the wood grain. Accumulation is often observed around joints, fasteners, and areas where
            oil/grease is likely to be splashed or dripped. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            settling. Edges and corners accumulate more oil/grease than flat surfaces due to surface tension effects. Top
            surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing are heavier than bottom surfaces. Crevices and joints act as traps for
            oil/grease, leading to higher concentrations. Sheltered areas accumulate more than exposed areas due to reduced
            weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, minimal discoloration, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant darkening, visible buildup,
            thickness 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Dark brown or black appearance, thick crust, thickness 0.1-1 mm. Extreme
            (>85%): Extensive coverage, very thick and hard deposits, thickness > 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cedar presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood, ranging
            from subtle amber hues to dark brown or black depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. The texture
            transitions from a slightly tacky film to a hardened, sometimes crusty layer with prolonged exposure and oxidation.
            Coverage patterns vary from localized spots to extensive coatings, often concentrated in areas prone to accumulation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating on horizontal surfaces, edge accumulation
            along joints and fasteners, point source spreading from leaks or spills, gradient from source with decreasing
            concentration further away, patchy/spotty distribution due to inconsistent application or splashing, streaky/linear
            patterns from drips or runs, and localized concentrations in crevices and corners.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to surface
            tension effects. The oil/grease tends to flow towards and collect at these points. While flat surfaces can develop
            a uniform coating, the edges will typically exhibit a higher concentration. This is due to the increased surface
            area and the tendency of liquids to minimize their surface energy by concentrating at edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It
            drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours,
            creating patterns that mimic the shape of the surface. It bridges gaps between adjacent surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in depressions. Vertical streaking is common on vertical surfaces. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes are observed. Oil/grease can hang from overhead
            surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and texture
            differences. Thicker deposits may exhibit a slight iridescence due to thin-film interference, particularly if
            the oil contains metallic additives.
          texture_details: Initially, the oil/grease feels slippery and slightly tacky to the touch. Over time, it becomes
            sticky and then hardens into a crusty or waxy layer. The surface can be smooth if the buildup is thin and uniform,
            or rough and uneven with thicker, oxidized deposits. The cedar grain may still be visible through thinner layers,
            but obscured by thicker deposits.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for initial contamination to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2
            mm or more in areas of prolonged exposure. Extremely aged deposits can reach thicknesses of several millimeters
            in sheltered locations.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks from gravity-driven
            flow, pools/puddles in depressions, thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in areas of heavy accumulation,
            discrete patches from splashing, spots/dots from airborne droplets, stains that penetrate the wood grain, uniform
            coatings on horizontal surfaces, buildups in corners and crevices, and potentially crystalline structures if certain
            additives are present (rare).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            with minor variations occurs on flat, horizontal surfaces exposed to consistent contamination. Moderately patchy
            distribution is common in areas subject to splashing or inconsistent application. Highly variable/irregular distribution
            is typical near leak sources or in areas with complex geometry. Concentration is often concentrated in specific
            areas like corners and crevices.
        cement:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a wet, glossy stain, often lighter in color. Over time, it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. The texture changes from oily to sticky to crusty. Aged
            contamination can become very difficult to remove and may penetrate deep into the cement matrix, causing permanent
            staining. Thickness increases over time as more material accumulates.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens
            over time as more oil/grease accumulates. Buildup often begins at contact points (e.g., around machinery) and
            then spreads outward. It can also start at edges and move inward. The accumulation can be gradual and uniform,
            or it can occur from point sources that expand outward. Layering effects may be observed with intermittent contamination
            events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can influence the rate of oxidation and buildup. Timeframes:
            Hours (initial film formation), days (visible staining), months (significant buildup), years (thick crusts).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light tan to yellowish-brown (#F0E68C to #DEB887)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Medium brown with reddish undertones (#A0522D)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown with hints of green/black (#4A4E4D)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black, often with a slight sheen (#000000)'
          - 'Oxidized/Dried: Dull, matte dark brown to grayish-black (#36454F)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and spreading
            from a central point source. Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more contamination due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Flat surfaces often exhibit a more uniform coating, while porous areas of the cement may show
            deeper penetration and staining.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and crevices tend to be heavier due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas may also have higher concentrations. Flat surfaces may have a more even distribution, but still vary based
            on porosity and surface imperfections. Exposed areas may experience some weathering and reduced concentration
            over time.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, crusty layer of oil/grease completely obscuring the cement surface. Thickness: >500
                μm.'
              visual: Thick, dark crust covering almost the entire surface.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick layer of oil/grease covering most of the surface. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual: Dark, glossy surface with visible buildup.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Noticeable staining with some visible oil/grease. Thickness: 10-50 μm.'
              visual: Lightly stained areas, some sheen.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant staining with a visible layer of oil/grease. Thickness: 50-100 μm.'
              visual: Darker staining, noticeable oil film.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or faint stains. Barely visible to the naked eye. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
              visual: Few scattered spots, minimal discoloration.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cement presents as a darkening stain, ranging from light tan to dark
            brown/black, often with a slightly glossy or wet appearance. The texture varies from a thin, almost invisible
            film to a thick, sticky or crusty layer, depending on the age and amount of contamination. Coverage patterns are
            highly variable, influenced by the source of the contamination and the cement surface's orientation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            drip marks (vertical streaks), edge accumulation (concentration along edges and joints), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to varying surface porosity),
            streaky/linear (following surface imperfections), localized concentrations (around machinery or equipment), and
            uniform coating (less common, but possible with widespread spraying or splashing).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to flow towards and concentrate along these features. While
            a uniform coating is possible under specific circumstances (e.g., spraying), it is less common than edge accumulation.
            The mechanism is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices and imperfections, filling depressions. It pools on flat areas
            due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating drip marks. It collects at edges due to surface tension.
            It follows contours and bridges gaps, especially with thicker accumulations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common on walls. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces, forming drips that eventually
            fall.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface irregularities. Heavily contaminated areas may appear
            almost black under low light conditions. The presence of metallic particles (e.g., from ZDDP) can create subtle
            iridescent effects in some cases.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination is typically oily or greasy to the touch, feeling slick and slightly sticky.
            As it ages and oxidizes, it can become more viscous, eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy residue. The
            surface can range from smooth and glossy (when wet) to rough and uneven (when dried and cracked). At a microscopic
            level, particulate matter from the cement and the oil itself may be visible, creating a heterogeneous texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Thin films can be as little as 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 50-200 μm. Heavy crusts can reach thicknesses of 1-5 mm or more, especially in areas of prolonged exposure
            or pooling.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (elongated streaks running vertically), runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks, but less defined), pools/puddles (accumulation in low-lying areas), thin films (nearly
            invisible layer), thick crusts (hardened, layered buildup), discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination),
            spots/dots (small, individual stains), stains (discoloration of the cement), uniform coatings (rare, but possible),
            buildups (accumulations over time), and potentially crystalline structures (rare, but possible with certain additives).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the source of the contamination and the surface characteristics
            of the cement. Porous or damaged areas will absorb more oil/grease, leading to uneven distribution. Splashing
            or spraying will also create a patchy pattern.
        ceramic matrix composites cmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light brown in color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming almost black and developing a matte or even cracked surface. The thickness increases
            over time, and the texture transitions from oily to crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens over days, becoming
            more visible. It often begins at contact points or leak sources and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate
            contamination first, then the buildup moves inward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #8B4513 (SaddleBrown), translucent sheen. Days old: #654321 (DarkBrown),
            slightly thicker, less translucent. Weeks old: #4A3020 (DarkCoffee), matte finish. Months old: #221E1E (Charcoal),
            hardened, cracked surface. Heavily oxidized: #544B42 (Taupe), dull, almost powdery appearance.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots and streaks, particularly near potential leak sources
            or areas of high friction. It accumulates first in crevices, edges, and areas where the CMC surface is not perfectly
            smooth. Drip marks are frequently observed on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices. Top surfaces may have more
            buildup due to settling of airborne contaminants. Corners and sheltered areas often accumulate more contamination
            than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, leading to higher concentration at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%): thin, patchy film,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable coating, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): thick, dark coating,
            thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): very thick, crusty layer, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on CMCs typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges from
            a thin sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with variations depending on
            the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, often exhibiting
            drip marks and streaks.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven
            application or wear), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (in crevices). Edge accumulation and
            point source spreading are the most prevalent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on Ceramic
            Matrix Composites CMCs. This is primarily due to surface tension effects and the tendency of liquids to minimize
            their surface area. The edges provide a lower energy state for the contaminant to reside.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. It accumulates in corners due to capillary
            action. It builds up in crevices because of reduced airflow and easier deposition. It pools on flat areas due
            to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to the viscosity
            of the oil/grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte appearance of aged contamination. There is typically no iridescence
            or rainbow effect unless there are extremely thin films present (less than 1 μm).
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slippery. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky as oxidation
            occurs. With prolonged exposure and heat cycling, it hardens into a crusty, sometimes brittle layer. At a microscopic
            level, it may exhibit a slightly granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific additives present.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or
            more in extreme cases. The average thickness in industrial settings is typically between 25-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), buildups (repeated
            contamination).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coverage is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, and
            the presence of localized sources of contamination.
        cerium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Aged
            contamination (months/years old) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more opaque. The texture transitions
            from oily to a hard, crusty residue. Color shifts from amber to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs with consistent exposure. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects are observed with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with light amber (#F0C808) hues. Lightly Aged: Dark amber to burnt umber
            (#8A3324). Moderately Aged: Dark brown (#3D3635) with reddish undertones. Heavily Aged: Black (#000000) with possible
            hints of dark green (#006400) due to oxidation products.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots and streaks initially, especially near lubrication points
            or areas of high friction. Over time, these spots coalesce, forming a more uniform coating. Accumulation is often
            more pronounced in crevices, edges, and areas shielded from direct exposure.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas accumulate more contamination than exposed flat surfaces. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal
            surfaces accumulate pools.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            patchy coating, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, darkens the surface, thickness around
            10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating, significant discoloration, thickness around 50-200 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Near-complete encasement, very thick and crusty, thickness exceeding 200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cerium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially, it
            appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a dark brown to black coloration.
            Coverage varies from localized spots to near-complete surface encasement, depending on exposure and duration.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication points), edge accumulation
            (due to surface tension), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (initial contamination),
            streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (after prolonged
            exposure).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the perimeter, creating a darker, thicker band at the edges compared
            to the center. This effect is more pronounced in the initial stages of contamination.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking
            is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen and iridescent rainbow
            effect due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals a more matte finish, with the color
            appearing darker and less vibrant. Aged contamination tends to have a dull, matte appearance regardless of lighting.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy consistency. Close inspection may reveal a fine, granular texture
            due to the presence of particulate contaminants and oxidation byproducts. Can range from smooth to rough depending
            on age and composition.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (fresh) to a heavy buildup of 100 μm to 1 mm (aged).
            Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (initial droplets), stains (penetrated into porous areas), and uniform
            coatings (after prolonged exposure).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Initially, the distribution is highly variable/irregular,
            concentrated around lubrication points. Over time, it can become mostly uniform with minor variations, especially
            on surfaces with consistent exposure. In sheltered areas, it remains moderately patchy.
        cherry:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Appears as a thin, glossy film, easily wiped away. Color is
            light amber. Aged contamination (months/years): Thickens and darkens, becoming a viscous or solid mass. Color
            shifts to dark brown or black. The surface becomes dull and attracts dirt, creating a matte finish. Cracking and
            crazing may occur in thick deposits.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation is less common than point source expansion. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to honey-colored (#E4D00A). Aged contamination: Dark
            amber (#8B4513) to dark brown (#654321) with possible blackening (#000000) due to oxidation and carbonization.
            Heavily oxidized areas may exhibit a reddish-brown hue (#A52A2A).'
          common_patterns: The buildup tends to concentrate along grain lines, in pores, and around knots in the cherry wood.
            It also accumulates at edges and in corners due to surface tension and gravity. Drip marks are common on vertical
            surfaces. Flat surfaces tend to develop a more uniform coating, although dust accumulation can create a mottled
            appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more buildup than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Corners and
            areas sheltered from cleaning efforts also exhibit higher concentrations. Top surfaces may be less contaminated
            than bottom surfaces due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with some
            areas of bare wood still visible. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick,
            dark coating. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement in a thick, hardened layer. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cherry wood presents as a darkening and discoloration of the surface,
            ranging from a subtle sheen to a thick, tacky coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown, with a
            tendency to accumulate in crevices and along grain lines. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface
            encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven
            application or cleaning), streaky/linear (from wiping or dripping), localized concentrations (in crevices or around
            fasteners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices and along grain lines due
            to capillary action. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at
            edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the wood surface. Fills depressions and pores.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker deposits. Runs down
            slopes, following the path of least resistance. May hang from overhead surfaces as droplets before dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen. As the oil oxidizes and becomes
            contaminated with dirt, the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends
            to highlight the unevenness of the buildup. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects,
            especially with certain additives.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy consistency. Dust and debris adhere readily, creating a rough, uneven
            surface. Close inspection may reveal a slightly granular or crystalline structure in aged deposits, especially
            if ZDDP is present.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. These values
            vary significantly depending on the source and duration of contamination.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flowing oil),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (from splashes or spills), spots/dots (from aerosolized oil), stains (penetration into the wood grain),
            uniform coatings (rare, usually after intentional application), buildups (at joints or seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, differences in surface roughness, gravity,
            and the presence of dust or other contaminants.
        chrome-plated steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, light amber film with a noticeable oily sheen. Aged contamination
            darkens to a dark brown or black, loses its sheen, and becomes more viscous and sticky. Thickness increases significantly
            over time, and oxidation products (rust-orange) become more prominent, especially in areas exposed to air and
            moisture.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours). Begins at contact points and lubrication points,
            then spreads outward (days). Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices (days-weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation
            on flat surfaces is slower (weeks-months). Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns (weeks-months).
            Layering effects occur as new contamination is deposited on top of older layers (months-years). Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) with iridescent sheen. Days old: Yellowish-brown (#A07A44).
            Weeks old: Medium brown (#8B4513). Months old: Dark brown to almost black (#301900) with reddish-brown (#B7410E)
            oxidation product inclusions. Heavily oxidized: Mottled dark brown and rust-orange (#D2691E).'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces are common. Accumulation in crevices, corners, and around bolt
            heads. A thin, often iridescent, film covers flat surfaces. Point source spreading from lubrication points. Streaking
            from wiping or fluid movement.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and bolt heads
            tend to accumulate more contamination. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with heavier concentrations at the bottom.
            Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to thicker buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film,
            5-20 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable brown film, 20-50 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, sticky
            coating, 50-200 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, >200 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on chrome-plated steel typically presents as a brownish, often iridescent,
            film that can range from a barely visible sheen to a thick, sticky coating. The buildup tends to accumulate in
            crevices and along edges, often exhibiting drip marks on vertical surfaces. Over time, it darkens and becomes
            more viscous.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary action),
            point source spreading (from lubrication points), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), and patchy/spotty distribution
            (due to uneven application or cleaning). A gradient from the source of contamination is also typical.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to 'wick' towards the edges. This effect is more pronounced on smooth surfaces. The center areas may have
            a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing
            a sheltered environment. Pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips on vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the chrome plating. Bridges small gaps
            and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads
            to thicker buildup. Runs down slopes, creating streaks. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, but less common
            due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a strong oily sheen and iridescence, especially under direct sunlight
            or bright artificial light. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, with less reflectivity. Under fluorescent
            lighting, the iridescent sheen may be less pronounced. Thick buildup can create shadows and highlights due to
            its uneven surface.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming increasingly sticky and viscous as it ages. Dust
            and debris adhere readily, creating a rough, slightly abrasive surface. Heavily oxidized buildup can become crusty
            and even slightly crystalline in localized areas due to ZDDP decomposition. Grain is typically not visible without
            magnification, but larger debris creates noticeable texture.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >1 mm. Varies significantly depending on the application and maintenance schedule.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (inclined surfaces),
            thin films (flat surfaces), thick crusts (heavily oxidized areas), discrete patches (uneven application), spots/dots
            (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), and buildups (corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It's usually concentrated
            in specific areas like crevices, edges, and near lubrication points. The non-uniformity is caused by gravity,
            surface tension, fluid dynamics, and the uneven application of lubricants.
        chromium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more viscous, often forming a hard, crusty layer. The
            color shifts from amber to dark brown or black, and the surface becomes dull and matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points (e.g., leaks, joints) then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move
            inward. A uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point sources that expand outward. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect
            the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with a slight amber tint (#F0C808)'
          - 'Lightly Aged: Dark amber to light brown (#A07A5F)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown to dark brown (#654321)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining if corrosion is present'
          - 'Oxidized: Matte black (#1E1E1E) with a dull, sooty appearance'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal crevices, and a
            general accumulation in areas with poor ventilation. It often starts as a thin film that gradually thickens, with
            heavier deposits forming around joints, seals, and areas of high friction.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and crevices tend to be heavier due to surface
            tension and capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also
            tend to have higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces show pooling.
            Exposed areas may have less buildup due to wiping or cleaning.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'A very thick, crusty layer that completely covers the chromium surface. The original surface is
                no longer visible. Thickness: >100 μm, potentially up to several millimeters.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'A thick, opaque layer that largely obscures the chromium surface. The color is dark brown or black.
                Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'A thin, patchy film with visible streaks or spots. The underlying chromium surface is still clearly
                visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'A more continuous film, but the chromium surface is partially obscured. The color is noticeably
                darker. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. May appear as a slight sheen under certain
                lighting conditions. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on chromium typically appears as a viscous, dark coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, opaque layer. The color is usually dark brown or black, with variations depending
            on the oil's age and composition. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas due to gravity and surface
            tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading (from leaks), gradient from source (decreasing
            thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations
            (around joints), and radial patterns (around rotating parts). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are
            most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared
            to the center areas. Uniform distribution is rare unless intentionally applied.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, follows contours, and can bridge small gaps. The smaller the feature, the greater the accumulation due
            to capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces and runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common
            due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and can display iridescent
            rainbow effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte
            appearance of aged buildup. The glossiness decreases significantly with age and oxidation.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. Heavily oxidized
            buildup can become crusty, hard, and even slightly abrasive due to the presence of particulate matter and oxidation
            products. It feels slippery when fresh, and increasingly gummy and difficult to remove as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (iridescent sheen) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (opaque,
            crusty layer). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in areas of persistent leakage or poor maintenance.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splatters), spots/dots (small leaks), stains (penetrated into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (around joints), and no crystalline structures are typically observed with these contaminants.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil/grease was intentionally applied as a coating. The uneven distribution is
            caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, airflow patterns, and the nature of the contamination
            source (e.g., leaks, splatters).
        cobalt:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, glossy, amber-colored film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes a thick, matte, dark brown or black crust. Oxidation products form a rust-colored (around
            #B7410E) layer on the surface. The aged buildup is significantly harder and more difficult to remove.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) then spreads outward. Accumulation can also start at edges
            and move inward. The rate of buildup depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the amount of oil/grease
            present. Layering effects can occur if different types of oil/grease are applied over time. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the viscosity and flow of the oil/grease, leading to variations in the
            buildup pattern.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#F0C808), Lightly Aged: Yellow-brown (#A0785A), Moderately Aged: Dark
            brown (#654321), Heavily Aged: Black-brown (#301E1E), Oxidized: Rust-brown (#B7410E) around edges.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low-lying areas,
            and a general tendency to accumulate more heavily on horizontal surfaces. Splatter patterns from machinery are
            also frequently observed. Edges and corners tend to accumulate thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in low-lying areas due to
            gravity. Edges and corners often accumulate thicker deposits due to surface tension effects. Crevices and sheltered
            areas also tend to have higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient, with thicker buildup at the
            bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Thickness:
            <5 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, translucent film with some visible spots and streaks. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A more noticeable coating with a distinct color and texture. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A
            thick, opaque coating that obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick,
            crusty layer that completely covers the surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on cobalt typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is initially a translucent amber, darkening
            to shades of brown and black with age and oxidation. Coverage patterns are often uneven, influenced by gravity
            and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splatter), streaky/linear (due to wiping or flow), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or around fasteners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It may bridge gaps if the gap is small enough.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            The rate of downward flow varies with viscosity and temperature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and can even show slight iridescence
            due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the buildup
            appear more matte. Aged buildup is generally non-reflective under all lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and eventually hardens into a crusty, sometimes granular surface. Microscopic examination may reveal embedded
            particulate matter. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of heavy accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splatter), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare),
            buildups (localized accumulations).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil/grease application.
        concrete:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, oily stain that is easily spread. Over time, it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris, becoming more viscous and less easily removed. Aged
            buildup can form a hard, almost tar-like crust that is deeply embedded in the concrete pores. Color shifts from
            light tan to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film that is almost invisible (hours). Begins at contact points (e.g., drips)
            and then spreads outward (days). Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices (weeks). Over time, the
            oil/grease thickens and hardens due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris (months). Layering effects
            can occur with repeated spills or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect the viscosity and spread
            of the oil/grease.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #E3DAC9 (Light Tan), Aged contamination: #4A3C30 (Dark Brown), Heavily oxidized:
            #262322 (Black), Areas with ZDDP oxidation: #B7410E (Rust-Orange), Areas with calcium sulfonate: #F0E68C (Khaki).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near machinery, streaks from leaks or spills, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            accumulation in low-lying areas and crevices, and a general darkening of the concrete surface in high-traffic
            areas. Often forms a gradient, with the highest concentration near the source of the leak or spill.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heaviest near the source of the contamination (e.g., leaking
            machinery, oil drums). Edges and corners tend to accumulate more oil/grease due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Low-lying areas and crevices also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical surfaces show a gradient from
            top to bottom due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible film (1-10 μm). Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            discoloration, thin oily film (10-50 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Darker staining, thicker oily layer (50-200 μm).
            Heavy (60-85%): Significant buildup, sticky or hardened crust (200-1000 μm). Extreme (>85%): Thick, tar-like coating,
            significant alteration of the concrete surface (>1000 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on concrete presents as a discoloration ranging from light tan to dark
            brown/black, often with a slightly glossy or wet appearance. The texture varies from a thin, almost invisible
            film to a thick, sticky or hardened crust, depending on the age and amount of the contamination. Distribution
            is often uneven, following gravity and surface contours.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around machinery), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splashing), streaky/linear
            (from spills or leaks), localized concentrations (in cracks and crevices), and radial patterns (around a central
            point of contamination).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The oil/grease tends to spread outward from the source, but the edges and corners act as collection points. This
            is especially noticeable on horizontal surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at edges, follows contours, and fills depressions. The
            surface geometry significantly influences the distribution pattern.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Oil/grease tends to pool at bottom edges and settle on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are common. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations in extreme
            cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker areas of buildup, making the contrast more pronounced. Heavily oxidized
            areas may appear matte. Rainbow iridescence can sometimes be observed in thin films due to light interference.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, slightly sticky. Aged: Tacky, gummy, hardened, sometimes crusty. Heavily
            oxidized: Dry, brittle, may exhibit a fine granular texture due to particulate accumulation. Surface can be smooth
            when a thin film, or rough with thicker buildup. May feel slightly abrasive due to embedded dirt and debris.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm, Light buildup: 10-100 μm, Moderate buildup: 100-500 μm, Heavy buildup: 0.5-2
            mm, Extreme buildup: >2 mm.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from spills), pools/puddles (in low-lying areas),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (splashes or spills), spots/dots
            (small leaks), stains (penetration into concrete pores), and buildups (around machinery).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely uniform due to the nature of oil/grease
            leaks and spills. It is concentrated near the source and tends to follow gravity and surface contours. The presence
            of cracks, crevices, and other surface imperfections further contributes to the non-uniformity.
        copper:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, translucent film with a slight sheen, amber in color.
            Aged contamination (months/years): Thick, opaque layer, dark brown to black in color, with a matte finish. The
            texture transitions from smooth and sticky to hard and crusty. Thickness increases significantly over time.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. Accumulation can also start at edges and move inward. The
            process can be a uniform gradual accumulation or occur from point sources that expand outward. Layering effects
            are common, especially with intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D4A373 (light amber), transitioning to #A0785A (medium brown) within days.
            Aged contamination: #6B4F4F (dark brown), with possible localized areas of #3D3C3A (black) due to carbonization,
            and #A4C639 (olive green) from copper oxidation products. Heavily oxidized areas may exhibit a reddish-brown,
            similar to #B7410E (burnt sienna).'
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges. Initial
            contamination may appear as localized spots or streaks, spreading over time to form a more continuous coating.
            Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Areas exposed to high temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces often accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas
            may also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show drip marks, indicating downward flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            translucent film with some visible accumulation in crevices. Moderate (30-60%): Opaque coating with uneven distribution,
            thickness around 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant buildup in certain areas, thickness
            around 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement with a thick, crusty layer, thickness exceeding 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on copper presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically a gradient from amber to dark brown,
            with localized areas of green or black due to copper corrosion products. Coverage varies from sparse spotting
            to complete encasement, depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (flow patterns), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The liquid tends to flow towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This effect is particularly pronounced in confined spaces or at sharp corners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to surface tension.
            It follows contours and fills depressions. The geometry dictates the flow paths and accumulation points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational influence. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces, forming a more uniform layer compared to vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker tones and unevenness of the buildup. Aged contamination typically has a
            matte finish, reflecting less light.
          texture_details: Fresh oil/grease is typically smooth and sticky to the touch. Over time, it oxidizes and polymerizes,
            becoming increasingly viscous and eventually forming a tacky, semi-solid layer. With prolonged exposure to heat
            and contaminants, it can harden into a crusty, brittle deposit. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. Varies significantly
            depending on the application and environmental conditions.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the copper surface), and buildups (at edges or
            joints).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare in industrial settings. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface temperature, airflow,
            contaminant source locations, and surface geometry.
        crown glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, transparent film with a light amber color. Over time,
            oxidation and polymerization cause the oil to darken, thicken, and become more viscous. Aged contamination can
            develop a crusty or hardened surface, and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Color shifts towards darker browns
            and blacks.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin film then thickens over time due to continued exposure. Begins at contact
            points (e.g., edges, corners) then spreads outward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than
            localized buildup. Point sources expand outward in radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes:
            Hours (initial film formation), days (noticeable thickening), months (significant buildup and oxidation).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F5DEB3 (light wheat, almost clear). Slightly aged: #DEB887 (BurlyWood,
            light amber). Moderately aged: #A0522D (Sienna, medium brown). Heavily aged/oxidized: #8B4513 (SaddleBrown, dark
            brown with reddish undertones). Severely aged/burnt: #221E1F (almost black, due to carbonization).'
          common_patterns: Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Accumulation often starts at edges and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Point source contamination
            leads to radial spreading patterns. Uniform coating is rare unless applied intentionally (e.g., during manufacturing).
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination often have higher concentrations than sheltered
            areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Corners and low spots accumulate more
            oil than flat surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film with some visible streaks and spots. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable film with significant
            streaking and pooling. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque film with extensive buildup. Thickness:
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup covering almost the entire surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on crown glass typically appears as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky or even
            slightly crusty with age. Coverage patterns depend heavily on the source and orientation of the glass, but often
            include streaks, drips, and localized accumulations.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (radial patterns), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), streaky/linear (due to flow
            or wiping), localized concentrations (in low spots or crevices), and patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal).
            Edge accumulation and gradient from source are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends
            to spread from the edges inward, but the center often remains thinner than the perimeter. Uniform distribution
            is rare. The mechanism is primarily surface tension and the tendency of liquids to minimize their surface area.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows
            contours of the glass surface. Bridges small gaps due to surface tension. Fills depressions due to gravity and
            capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is significant on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading
            to thicker accumulations. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hanging from overhead surfaces
            is possible, but less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged films tend to
            have a more matte finish due to surface oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. Iridescence or rainbow
            effects are possible with very thin films (interference fringes), but less common with thicker buildup. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker tones and textures.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, slippery to the touch. Slightly aged: Tacky, sticky, slightly viscous. Moderately
            aged: Viscous, slightly rubbery, may attract dust. Heavily aged: Hardening, crusty, may exhibit a slight tackiness.
            Severely aged: Brittle, cracked, potentially powdery or flaking.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >1 mm. Varies significantly based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal
            surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized spills),
            spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into surface imperfections), uniform coatings (rare, intentional application),
            buildups (accumulation over time). Drip marks and thin films are most common initially.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is the most common. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform
            due to variations in the source of contamination, airflow patterns, surface geometry, and cleaning practices.
            Even intentional coatings can have minor thickness variations. Expect significant patchiness and localized concentrations.
        dolomite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. As it ages, the color
            darkens, the viscosity increases, and the surface becomes less reflective. Long-term exposure leads to the formation
            of a thick, hardened crust with a matte finish and potential cracking.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days/weeks. Begins at contact points
            (e.g., drips) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward, especially on horizontal surfaces. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns.
            Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations can influence viscosity and flow
            rates, affecting buildup patterns.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D4A373 (Sandy Brown), transitioning to #A0785A (Umber) within days. Aged
            contamination: #654321 (Dark Brown), #4A3020 (Burnt Umber) with possible black (#000000) deposits from carbonization.
            Oxidized surfaces may exhibit a reddish-brown hue (#8B4513, Saddle Brown).'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in horizontal crevices, and a
            general coating on exposed areas. Accumulation is often more pronounced around edges and corners due to surface
            tension effects. Point source contamination results in radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Top surfaces
            exposed to dripping contamination will be heavier than bottom surfaces. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate
            more buildup than exposed flat surfaces. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film with some visible discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with drip marks and localized buildup.
            Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant accumulation in crevices. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage
            with a thick, hardened crust. Thickness correlates with coverage, ranging from 1 μm (sparse) to >500 μm (extreme).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on dolomite typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges
            in color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly glossy or matte finish depending on age and oxidation.
            It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, forming drip marks and localized concentrations.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application), edge accumulation
            (very common), point source spreading (around leaks), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (in
            crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The liquid tends to spread along the perimeter, creating a thicker band at the edge compared
            to the center. This effect is more pronounced on porous surfaces like dolomite.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing
            sheltered areas. Pools on flat areas, especially if slightly inclined. Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks.
            Collects at edges, forming a thicker band. Follows contours, conforming to the surface shape. Bridges gaps, creating
            a continuous film across small openings. Fills depressions, leveling out uneven surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges. Drip marks are a
            direct result of gravity pulling the liquid downwards. Vertical streaking is common on vertical surfaces. Settling
            occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness.
            Hanging droplets may form on overhead surfaces before detaching.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the darker shades and highlights surface irregularities. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish, reducing reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as volatile components evaporate. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty or waxy solid.
            Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup exceeding 1 mm in
            localized areas. Typical average thickness on exposed surfaces is between 25-250 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous dolomite), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (at joints and seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, gravity, airflow patterns,
            and the method of contamination (e.g., drips vs. spray).
        dysprosium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, glossy film with a light amber or brown color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming black or very dark brown. The texture changes from oily to sticky to hard and
            crusty. Thickness increases over time, and corrosion products may become visible underneath the grease layer.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. It
            often begins at contact points or lubrication points, then spreads outward. Accumulation starts at edges and moves
            inward. Uniform gradual accumulation can occur in enclosed environments. Point sources expand outward. Layering
            effects are common with repeated applications. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the
            rate of oxidation and hardening.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with underlying metallic dysprosium color (silver-gray)'
          - 'Light Contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#996515)'
          - 'Moderate Contamination: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish undertones due to oxidation products'
          - 'Heavy Contamination: Black (#000000) to very dark brown (#332200) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) spotting
            if corrosion is present'
          - 'Aged Contamination: Matte black (#000000) with a possible dull gray (#808080) powdery surface due to hardened
            oxidation products.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns vary. Initially, a thin film may spread uniformly. Over time, gravity and
            surface tension cause accumulation in low points, crevices, and edges. Splatter patterns and drip marks are common
            near lubrication points. Heat can cause localized coking and hardening.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and crevices tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension and gravity. Top surfaces may have less buildup due to runoff. Corners and sheltered areas
            accumulate more grease than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces collect
            pools.

              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Appears as slight discoloration.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on dysprosium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a brownish-black hue.
            Coverage varies significantly depending on the environment and application, ranging from sparse spotting to complete
            surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: uniform coating (initial stages), edge accumulation (due to surface
            tension), point source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            radial patterns (splatter). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially initially. This is
            because the oil tends to flow towards the edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, follows contours, and fills depressions. Sharp edges often have thicker buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are observed. Grease can hang from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the true color more accurately. Aged, hardened grease tends to have a matte finish. Iridescence
            may be present in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and ages, it becomes
            sticky and tacky. With further aging, it can harden into a crusty, waxy, or even brittle solid. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of severe accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into surface imperfections), uniform coatings
            (initial application), buildups (accumulated over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Initially, it might be mostly uniform with minor variations. Over time,
            it becomes moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. This is due to factors like gravity, temperature gradients,
            and localized wear or corrosion.
        ebony:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, barely altering the ebony's original color.
            Over days, it darkens and thickens, becoming more noticeable. Months or years of accumulation result in a thick,
            hardened layer that obscures the underlying ebony, often exhibiting a matte or cracked surface. Color shifts towards
            darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days. It often begins at contact points
            or lubrication points then spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges then move inward. Gradual accumulation
            is common, but point sources can create localized buildups that expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated
            applications. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect viscosity and spread.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Near black, often with a greenish or bluish sheen (#222222) due to oxidation and metallic additives.'
          - 'Oxidized/Dried: Matte dark brown to black with chalky appearance (#4A4444)'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly starts in crevices, edges, and areas of high friction or contact. It then
            spreads outwards, forming streaks, drips, and pools. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate thicker layers than
            vertical surfaces. Areas exposed to heat may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas trap more contaminant. Flat
            horizontal surfaces accumulate thicker layers than vertical surfaces. Exposed areas may experience some removal
            due to wiping or abrasion.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete encasement in a thick, hardened layer. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              visual: Ebony surface completely obscured by a thick, hardened layer of oil/grease, potentially with cracks
                or crusts.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark layer covering most of the surface. Thickness: 200-500 μm.'
              visual: Ebony surface almost completely obscured by a dark, thick layer of oil/grease.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film covering some areas, more noticeable darkening. Thickness: 10-50 μm.'
              visual: Ebony surface partially obscured, with a slight darkening and dulling effect.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant darkening and buildup, obscuring much of the ebony. Thickness: 50-200 μm.'
              visual: Ebony surface largely obscured, with a noticeable oily or greasy layer.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots and streaks, barely noticeable. Thickness: 2-10 μm.'
              visual: Ebony surface mostly visible, with faint oily sheen in isolated areas.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on ebony presents as a darkening and dulling of the surface, transitioning
            from a subtle sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color shifts from a light amber to a dark, almost black, sludge
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete encasement,
            often highlighting surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to capillary action), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (flow along surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            and drip marks (vertical surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. It also concentrates in center areas if applied directly or if gravity pulls it towards the
            center of a horizontal surface. Uniform distribution is rare. The mechanism is primarily surface tension and gravity.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in depressions and pools on flat areas. It drips on vertical surfaces and
            collects at edges. It follows contours and bridges small gaps. Sharp edges tend to have higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease hangs
            from overhead surfaces, eventually dripping. The rate of downward flow depends on viscosity and temperature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light. As it ages
            and oxidizes, the sheen diminishes, becoming matte. Thicker deposits may show iridescence or a rainbow effect
            due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the dullness and darkening effect.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, becoming increasingly sticky and tacky as it ages and
            oxidizes. Over time, it can harden into a crusty or gummy consistency. Microscopic examination reveals a non-uniform
            surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness, often containing particulate matter. Touch varies from
            slippery to extremely adhesive.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 5-10 mm or more in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (angled surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings
            (rare), and buildups (localized accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, gravity, surface irregularities, temperature
            gradients, and differential evaporation rates. Areas near lubrication points or moving parts tend to have higher
            concentrations.
        epoxy resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, glossy film with a light amber or golden
            brown color. Aged contamination (months/years old) darkens to a dark brown or black color, becomes thicker and
            more viscous, and may develop a matte or crusty surface due to oxidation and the accumulation of dust and debris.
            The aged material is significantly more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days). It often begins at contact
            points or edges then spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point sources
            that expand outward (weeks/months). Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in temperature can affect viscosity and spread rate, leading to variations in buildup rate.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#996515). Moderately aged: Dark brown
            (#654321) with reddish undertones. Heavily aged/oxidized: Black (#000000) with possible greyish (#808080) or rust-colored
            (#B7410E) patches due to oxidation of metallic additives. Color can also vary depending on the specific oil/grease
            composition; some may have a greenish tint due to copper-based additives.'
          common_patterns: 'The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include: accumulation along edges and corners
            due to surface tension; drip marks on vertical surfaces; pooling in low-lying areas; and localized spots around
            lubrication points or leaks. On horizontal surfaces, a gradient from the source of contamination is often observed.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination are often heavier than sheltered undersides.
            Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, leading to higher concentrations at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            more evenly but still show variations based on airflow and settling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with visible patches and streaks. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating
            with some areas still visible. Thickness: 20-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick, dark
            layer. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement with a very thick, often crusty layer. Thickness:
            >200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on epoxy resin composites typically presents as a viscous, dark coating
            that ranges from a thin sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with a slightly
            glossy or matte finish depending on the age and oxidation level. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete
            surface encasement, often concentrating in low-lying areas and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension),
            point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent application or splashing), streaky/linear (due to dripping or wiping), localized
            concentrations (in crevices or corners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most frequently
            observed patterns.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This is a very common and easily observable phenomenon.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat
            areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit dripping. Edges act as collection points. Depressions
            fill with oil/grease. The geometry significantly influences the distribution pattern.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity. Horizontal surfaces experience settling and more
            uniform accumulation. Slopes exhibit runs. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets. The downward flow rate
            depends on the viscosity of the oil/grease and the surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a more subdued, matte appearance, especially with aged contamination. Thick buildup may show
            slight iridescence due to thin-film interference, particularly with certain additives. The color appears darker
            under low light conditions.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and tacky. With heavy buildup, it can form a crusty or gummy layer. Microscopic examination may reveal a non-uniform
            surface with small particulates and solidified oil droplets. The surface can range from glossy to matte depending
            on the degree of oxidation and the presence of dust or debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or more.
            Extremely heavy buildup can reach several millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, heavily oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (splashes or localized leaks), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into porous areas),
            uniform coatings (rare, usually from intentional application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, gravity, airflow, and the
            method of contamination. Areas near the source of contamination are significantly thicker than areas further away.
        europium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, translucent amber film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) becomes a thick, opaque, dark brown or black crust. The surface of aged contamination often
            exhibits a matte finish and may be cracked or flaking.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens over days and
            weeks, especially at contact points and edges. Over months, the contamination spreads outward from these initial
            points, forming a more extensive coating. Layering effects can occur with repeated applications of lubricant or
            exposure to different contaminants. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can influence the rate of
            buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber with slight iridescence (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Dark amber to light brown (#A07A55)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301919)'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Black with a matte finish (#000000)'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots and streaks, especially near lubrication points or areas
            of mechanical contact. It accumulates first in crevices, edges, and areas where dust and debris can collect. Drip
            marks are often visible on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            the collection of debris. Top surfaces exposed to dust and debris tend to have higher concentrations than sheltered
            areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity.

          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Europium typically presents as a viscous, dark brown to black coating.
            Initially, it appears as a thin, slightly iridescent film, gradually thickening and darkening with age. The buildup
            tends to accumulate in crevices and edges, creating a non-uniform distribution.
          distribution_patterns: 'The most common distribution patterns are: edge accumulation (due to surface tension and
            capillary action), point source spreading (from lubrication points), streaky/linear (due to movement and wiping),
            localized concentrations (in crevices and low points), and drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: The buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The oil/grease tends to wick along edges, creating a darker, thicker band compared to the center areas. This effect
            is more pronounced on rough or porous surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            Edges act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes.
            The effect is more pronounced with higher temperatures and lower viscosity oils.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence due to thin-film
            interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the dark, matte finish of aged contamination. The
            color appears deeper and richer under direct light.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy consistency. Close inspection may reveal fine particulate matter embedded
            within the grease matrix. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte when heavily oxidized.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. The thickness varies significantly depending on the location and duration of exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity
            and fluid flow), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches (localized
            spills or leaks), and stains (penetration into porous surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, airflow patterns, and
            the location of lubrication points.
        fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a thin, light amber film, almost transparent. Aged contamination
            (months/years) is a thick, dark brown to black crust, often with a matte finish and a hardened texture. The aged
            buildup may also exhibit cracking or flaking due to thermal cycling and embrittlement.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens in specific areas due to gravity and
            surface tension (days). It begins at contact points (leaks, spills) and spreads outward (days/weeks). It often
            starts at edges and moves inward (weeks/months). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect
            the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C27B), almost translucent. Days old: Medium amber (#D4A061)
            with slight darkening. Weeks old: Dark amber (#B7823E) with hints of brown. Months old: Dark brown (#654321) with
            possible blackening due to oxidation. Years old: Black (#000000) with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in horizontal crevices, and accumulates
            along edges and corners. Initial contamination often appears as a thin, even film, which then thickens in specific
            areas due to gravity and surface tension. Point source contamination will spread radially outwards, creating a
            gradient of thickness.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity
            and pooling. Edges and corners also tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface tension. Vertical walls exhibit
            a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier buildup at the bottom due to drip marks. Sheltered areas may accumulate
            more buildup than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible accumulation in crevices, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with distinct drip marks and pooling, thickness 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant
            buildup, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick crust, almost completely obscuring the FRPU surface,
            thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on FRPU typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges in
            color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly tacky or sticky texture. The buildup tends to accumulate
            in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges, creating a non-uniform distribution pattern.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (radial gradient), drip marks (vertical surfaces), pooling in crevices (horizontal surfaces),
            and patchy/spotty distribution (uneven application or localized leaks). Edge accumulation and drip marks are particularly
            common.'
          edge_center_behavior: The buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension. It also concentrates
            in center areas of horizontal surfaces due to pooling. Uniform distribution is rare. The edge accumulation is
            driven by the tendency of liquids to minimize surface area.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to
            surface tension. It follows contours, bridging gaps and filling depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. The buildup settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes.
            Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the amber color more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, reducing reflectivity.
            Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with very thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            due to oxidation and polymerization. With prolonged exposure and heat cycling, the surface can develop a crusty
            or hardened texture, sometimes with a slight granular feel due to the accumulation of particulate matter. The
            surface can also exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, transitioning to a matte finish as it ages.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm, resembling a thick crust.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized leaks), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the FRPU matrix), and buildups (accumulation
            over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, gravity, airflow patterns, and the location
            of the contamination source.
        fiberglass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (days to weeks), it darkens and thickens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dust and debris. Aged contamination (months to years) becomes a hard,
            crusty layer that is often difficult to remove. The color shifts from light brown to dark brown or black, and
            the surface becomes matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours). It then thickens over time (days to weeks)
            due to continued contamination and oxidation. Buildup often begins at contact points or edges and then spreads
            inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects
            occur as new oil deposits on top of older, hardened layers. Seasonal variations can occur due to changes in temperature
            and humidity, affecting the viscosity and spread of the oil.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E) with a slight sheen.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484), becoming more opaque.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#A0785A) with hints of orange due to oxidation.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E), often with a matte finish.'
          - 'Extreme Buildup: Black (#000000) with potential iridescent sheen from layered oxidation products and contaminants.'
          common_patterns: The distribution pattern is highly dependent on the orientation of the fiberglass surface and the
            source of the contamination. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas,
            and a general accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Edges and crevices tend to collect more buildup than flat surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Top surfaces of horizontal areas may have heavier buildup due to settling of airborne contaminants.
            Bottom edges of vertical surfaces will have heavier buildup due to gravity-induced dripping. Sheltered areas may
            accumulate more oil than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning by rain or wind.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, hardened buildup. Black color. Thickness: >1 mm.'
              visual_appearance: Fiberglass surface completely covered with a very thick, hardened layer of oil/grease.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, crusty layer. Dark brown or black color. Thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm.'
              visual_appearance: Fiberglass surface mostly covered with a thick layer of oil/grease.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film. Some discoloration. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Fiberglass surface slightly discolored with visible oil film.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable buildup, darker color. Thickness: 10-100 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Fiberglass surface significantly discolored with a visible layer of oil/grease.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or droplets, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Fiberglass surface mostly clean with a few scattered spots.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on fiberglass typically presents as a discolored, often sticky or hardened
            layer. The color ranges from light tan to dark brown or black, depending on the oil type, age, and environmental
            conditions. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement, often with noticeable drip marks
            and accumulation in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually from spray application),
            2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension effects), 3) Point source spreading (oil leaking from a specific
            location), 4) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source), 5) Patchy/spotty
            (uneven distribution due to inconsistent application or localized leaks), 6) Streaky/linear (drip marks on vertical
            surfaces), 7) Localized concentrations (pooling in low-lying areas).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension effects. The oil tends to spread along the surface until it reaches an edge, where it is held by surface
            tension. Capillary action also draws oil into crevices. Uniform distribution is rare unless the oil was intentionally
            applied as a coating.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools
            on flat areas due to gravity. On vertical surfaces, it drips and runs downwards. It collects at edges due to surface
            tension. It follows contours of the fiberglass surface. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior, pooling
            at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, and vertical streaking. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces. It
            runs down slopes. Small amounts can hang from overhead surfaces due to surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As the oil ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Heavily contaminated areas may exhibit a dull, flat appearance. Iridescence can
            occur in areas with very thin films or layered deposits due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Fresh oil is typically smooth and slippery to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With further aging and oxidation, it hardens into a crusty or waxy layer. The surface can range from smooth to
            rough, depending on the accumulation thickness and the presence of particulate matter. Microscopic examination
            may reveal a layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of significant
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks from dripping oil), 2) Runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks but less defined), 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation in low-lying areas), 4) Thin films (initial
            stage of contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged, hardened oil), 6) Discrete patches (localized areas of contamination),
            7) Spots/dots (small, isolated droplets), 8) Stains (discoloration of the fiberglass surface), 9) Uniform coatings
            (rare, intentional application), 10) Buildups (thick accumulations in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil was intentionally applied as a coating. Variations are caused by uneven application,
            gravity, surface geometry, and the location of the contamination source.
        fir:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film, often with a slight sheen. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming more opaque and viscous. The surface texture transitions from smooth to tacky
            and eventually crusty. Thickness increases over time, leading to a more pronounced buildup.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            points) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; point sources
            that expand outward are more common. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination. Seasonal variations may
            be observed due to temperature and humidity changes.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: #F0E68C (Khaki), Aged (days): #A07A49 (Sienna), Aged (weeks): #654321 (Dark Brown), Heavily
            Oxidized (months): #362917 (Seal Brown), Heavily Contaminated (years): #000000 (Black, especially if carbonized).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is typically non-uniform. It tends to concentrate along edges, in knots and crevices,
            and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Point source
            spreading occurs around lubrication points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices. Horizontal surfaces tend
            to accumulate more contamination than vertical surfaces. The top of a vertical surface may show less contamination
            due to runoff. Sheltered areas may accumulate more contamination due to reduced cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible streaks and spots, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating
            with some areas of thicker buildup, thickness 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant coating with thick, dark
            areas, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, almost varnish-like coating covering most of the surface,
            thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on fir presents as a viscous, darkening coating that initially appears
            glossy but becomes matte and tacky with age. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, with accumulation
            often concentrated in crevices and along edges. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to a thick, almost varnish-like
            layer.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), streaky/linear (on
            vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized concentrations (in crevices and knots).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along
            the edges of the fir, creating a darker, more concentrated band. This effect is more pronounced on rough-sawn
            fir than on planed surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows
            contours of the wood grain. Fills depressions and knots.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the amber or brown coloration more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, reducing
            reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as oxidation occurs. Over time,
            a crusty or gummy texture develops, especially in areas with heavy buildup. May exhibit a slight graininess due
            to particulate matter accumulation. Feels like a thick varnish when heavily built up.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm, Light buildup: 10-50 μm, Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm, Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm, Extreme buildup: >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (around lubrication points), stains (penetration into the wood grain), uniform coatings (rare,
            but possible with spray application), buildups (at edges and in crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely uniform due to variations in surface
            texture, gravity, and the method of contamination. Crevices and edges tend to accumulate more contamination than
            flat surfaces. The presence of knots and grain patterns also influences distribution.
        float glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more opaque. The texture changes
            from smooth to sticky and eventually crusty. Cracking and flaking may occur in heavily aged deposits.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film that gradually thickens over time. It often begins
            at contact points or edges and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than
            point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur if there are multiple contamination events. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, influencing the buildup
            rate. The timeframe for significant buildup can range from days to months, depending on the severity of the contamination
            and environmental conditions.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F5DEB3 (light wheat), aging to #DEB887 (burlywood), then #A0522D (sienna),
            and finally #8B4513 (saddlebrown) with possible localized areas of #000000 (black) due to carbonization. The color
            can also vary depending on the specific additives in the oil/grease; ZDDP can contribute a slight yellow tint.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include streaks from dripping, localized spots from splatters, and a general film
            coating the surface. Accumulation is often observed at the edges of the glass and in any surface imperfections
            or crevices. Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution, leading to downward runs and pooling at the
            bottom.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the edges and bottom of vertical surfaces due to
            gravity. Corners and crevices also accumulate more contamination. Flat, horizontal surfaces tend to have a more
            even distribution, but can also accumulate dust and debris, leading to localized concentrations. Exposed areas
            may have less buildup due to wind or cleaning, while sheltered areas accumulate more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film or isolated spots. Thickness: 1-2 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Translucent film with some visible streaks or patches. Thickness: 2-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Opaque
            film with noticeable discoloration and texture. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, crusty layer with
            significant buildup. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, heavily encrusted layer with potential
            cracking and flaking. Thickness: >200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on float glass typically appears as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture can vary from smooth and oily to sticky and crusty, depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with accumulation at edges
            and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (from leaks or splatters), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (common due to uneven application or cleaning), streaky/linear (from
            dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners), and radial patterns (around a central
            point source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at the edges of the glass. This is
            due to surface tension effects, where the oil/grease tends to minimize its surface area by concentrating at the
            perimeter. Capillary action also draws the oil/grease into the narrow space between the glass and any surrounding
            frame or structure.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. The oil/grease accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical
            surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows contours, conforming to
            the shape of the surface. It may bridge small gaps or fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior, leading
            to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common result. The oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a more even distribution. It runs down slopes, following the path of
            least resistance. It can hang from overhead surfaces as droplets before eventually dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or oily gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish due to the accumulation of dust and oxidation products. Iridescence or rainbow effects
            are generally not observed unless the film thickness is extremely uniform and in the range of visible light wavelengths
            (rare). Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the uneven distribution and darker coloration of aged deposits.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. Over time, oxidation and polymerization
            cause it to become sticky and eventually crusty. Dust and debris often adhere to the surface, creating a rough,
            sandpaper-like feel. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or
            even thicker (easily visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach 1-2 mm in areas of heavy accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from liquid flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (from splatters), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (discoloration of the glass surface), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (at edges and corners). Crystalline structures are not typically observed with this type of contamination.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in the application method, surface irregularities,
            gravity, and the accumulation of dust and debris.
        fused silica:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, almost invisible film with a slight sheen. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more opaque. The texture transitions from oily to sticky and eventually
            to a hard, crusty residue. Cracking and flaking may occur in heavily aged deposits.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens over time,
            becoming more visible and colored. The process often begins at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering effects can occur with
            repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup. Timeframes: Hours: Initial film formation. Days: Visible color change and thickening. Months: Significant
            buildup and crust formation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3), almost transparent. Days old: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484).
            Weeks old: Medium brown (#A0785A). Months old: Dark brown (#654321) with possible black (#000000) oxidation spots.
            Heavily oxidized: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with a reddish tinge.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. Uniform coatings
            are rare, typically only occurring in controlled deposition environments.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas trap more contamination than exposed
            areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces show pooling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible film, slight sheen. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            translucent film, slight color change. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable film, distinct color,
            some pooling. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque film, significant pooling and buildup. Thickness: 25-100
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer, heavy buildup. Thickness: >100 μm, potentially reaching mm scale.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on fused silica typically appears as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky or even
            crusty as it ages and oxidizes. Coverage patterns are often non-uniform, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (flow along surface features), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners).
            Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edge of the fused silica surface, drawing more material to that location. This
            is especially noticeable in areas where the oil/grease is applied or deposited near an edge.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, following contours and bridging small gaps.
            Depressions fill with oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Hanging droplets may form on overhead surfaces before detaching.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the color variations more clearly. Heavily oxidized deposits tend to have a matte finish. Thin films may
            exhibit iridescence or rainbow effects due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            due to oxidation and polymerization. With prolonged exposure and heat, it can harden into a crusty or even slightly
            crystalline solid. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-2
            mm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 5 mm or more in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into surface imperfections), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (localized accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven deposition, gravity, surface tension, and the presence of
            surface imperfections.
        gallium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Aged contamination
            becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The texture changes from smooth to sticky and eventually crusty. Oxidation
            and polymerization cause the oil to harden and become more difficult to remove. Particulate matter becomes embedded,
            creating a grimy surface. Color shifts towards darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or edges. It
            then spreads outwards, thickening over time. The progression can also begin at edges and move inward, gradually
            covering the entire surface. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outwards,
            creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes: Hours - initial film formation; Days -
            noticeable discoloration and thickening; Months - significant buildup and hardening.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent with a slight yellow tint (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484), noticeable darkening'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#A0785A), more opaque'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E), significant darkening and oxidation'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E) with black particulate inclusions'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges
            due to gravity and surface tension. Initial contamination often starts as localized spots or streaks, spreading
            outwards over time. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Areas exposed to higher temperatures may exhibit
            a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also
            tend to have higher concentrations. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform, but still uneven, coating. Vertical
            walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, leading to a concentration gradient from top to bottom.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, complete coating with heavy buildup. Thickness: >100 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Completely obscured surface, thick crusty layer, significant accumulation in low-lying areas.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, almost complete coating with significant discoloration. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Darkened surface, thick coating, significant buildup at edges and corners.

              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Slightly discolored surface, visible streaks or spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable coating with some areas of bare gallium. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Opaque coating, uneven distribution, visible buildup in crevices.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Barely perceptible sheen, isolated droplets.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on gallium typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from light amber to dark brown, depending on
            the age and composition of the contaminant. The texture is generally sticky and attracts particulate matter, leading
            to a grimy appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (in crevices or low
            points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center. While the center
            may have a coating, it is typically thinner and more uniform. This behavior is driven by the minimization of surface
            energy.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them
            completely. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker deposits. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks.
            It collects at edges, creating a raised rim. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface. It bridges
            gaps, creating connections between adjacent surfaces. It fills depressions, leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. It causes downward flow behavior, leading to
            pooling at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker deposits. It runs down slopes, following the path
            of least resistance. It hangs from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip down.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight iridescent sheen due to thin-film
            interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the yellow/brown tones. Aged buildup has a matte
            finish and reflects less light. The presence of particulate matter can create a dull, uneven appearance. Thicker
            deposits may cast shadows, emphasizing the uneven surface.
          texture_details: Initially, the oil/grease is smooth and slightly viscous. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            attracting dust and debris. Aged buildup can be crusty and hardened, especially if exposed to high temperatures
            or UV radiation. The surface can exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, transitioning to a matte finish as it ages
            and oxidizes. Tactile feel ranges from slippery to gritty depending on age and particulate contamination.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Thin film: 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-50 μm. Heavy buildup:
            100-500 μm or more. Extreme buildup can reach thicknesses of 1-2 mm, especially in areas of pooling or accumulation.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatters or small leaks), stains (penetration into the gallium surface), uniform
            coatings (rare, but possible with controlled application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of contamination. Gravity also plays a significant role in creating uneven distribution.
        gallium arsenide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, transparent or translucent film with
            a light amber color. Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more
            opaque. The texture changes from oily to sticky or even hard and crusty. Cracking and flaking may also occur in
            heavily aged deposits.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) then spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges then
            move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering effects
            can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate
            of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber (#F0C808) or pale yellow (#FFFFE0) film. As
            it ages and oxidizes, it transitions to a burnt sienna (#B7410E) or reddish-brown (#A52A2A). Heavily aged deposits
            can become almost black (#000000) due to carbonization and the accumulation of particulate matter. Sulfurized
            additives can impart a greenish-brown hue (#808000).
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots around lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing,
            and accumulation in crevices and along edges. A thin, uniform film may initially cover the entire surface, but
            this quickly evolves into more localized deposits due to gravity and surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more contamination than vertical surfaces due to settling of
            airborne particles and gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also tend to have higher concentrations. Top surfaces
            may have less buildup if exposed to cleaning or wiping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, isolated spots, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, translucent film, easily wiped off, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable film, some discoloration,
            requires solvent for removal, thickness 10-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer, significant discoloration,
            difficult to remove, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty deposit, dark color, requires aggressive
            cleaning, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Gallium Arsenide typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a barely visible sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from light amber to dark brown, depending
            on age and composition, and the distribution is often influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to pooling
            and streaking.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (initially, but unstable). 2)
            Edge accumulation (due to surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (from lubrication points). 4) Gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized contamination).
            6) Streaky/linear (due to dripping or wiping). Localized concentrations are common around fasteners and joints.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to minimize its surface area, leading to concentration along the perimeter. This effect is
            more pronounced on clean surfaces. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform film, especially initially.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to have
            more buildup than rounded edges.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are common. Oil/grease hangs from overhead surfaces until the weight overcomes adhesion.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, more oxidized areas. Heavily contaminated surfaces may appear matte due
            to the accumulation of particulate matter. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference
            effects.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to tacky and sticky as it ages. With significant
            oxidation and polymerization, it can become crusty and hard. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or
            amorphous structure, depending on the specific contaminants present. It feels greasy initially, then becomes more
            resinous and less slippery over time.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible to the naked eye) to several millimeters in areas
            of heavy buildup. A thin film might be 1-10 μm thick, while a heavy deposit can reach 0.5-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (inclined surfaces).
            3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces). 4) Thin films (initial contamination). 5) Thick crusts (aged deposits).
            6) Discrete patches (localized contamination). 7) Spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition). 8) Stains (penetration
            into porous areas, if present).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. A perfectly
            uniform coating is rare and short-lived. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, gravity,
            airflow, and the method of contamination. Surface roughness also contributes to non-uniformity.
        gallium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time, it
            darkens and thickens, becoming more opaque and viscous. Aged contamination often exhibits a hardened, crusty surface
            with a darker, more saturated color. The buildup can become layered, with older, more oxidized layers underneath
            newer, fresher deposits.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and becomes more viscous (days). Begins at contact
            points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward (days-weeks). Starts at edges and moves inward (weeks-months).
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns
            (weeks-months). Layering effects occur as new contamination is deposited on top of older, oxidized layers (months-years).
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (khaki), aging to #D2B48C (tan), then #A0522D (sienna), and finally
            #8B4513 (saddlebrown) with possible blackening (#000000) due to oxidation and carbonization. Some areas may exhibit
            a greenish-brown iridescence due to thin-film interference.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, and accumulation in
            low-lying areas due to gravity. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more due to surface tension and capillary
            action. A gradient of thickness often exists, with thicker deposits closer to the source of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying areas also tend to have higher
            concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit streaks and drip marks, while horizontal surfaces may have more uniform
            pooling. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or wiping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and droplets, barely visible film (thickness < 1 μm). Light
            (10-30%): Thin, translucent film with some visible streaks and spots (thickness 1-10 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Opaque
            film with significant streaks, spots, and pooling (thickness 10-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, viscous coating
            with extensive coverage and significant buildup (thickness 50-200 μm). Extreme (>85%): Near-complete coverage
            with thick, hardened deposits and significant buildup (thickness >200 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Gallium Nitride typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating
            ranging from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a smooth, oily film to a hardened, sticky residue,
            often accumulating in crevices and edges. Coverage patterns depend on the source and duration of exposure, ranging
            from sparse spots to near-complete coverage.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: point source spreading (oil leaking from a bearing),
            edge accumulation (oil wicking along edges), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven distribution due to splashing or spraying), streaky/linear (oil running down a surface), and localized
            concentrations (oil pooling in low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas. This effect is particularly
            pronounced on sharp edges and corners. The mechanism is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Collects at edges due to capillary
            action. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps between closely spaced components. Fills depressions and
            indentations.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is significant, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker deposits. Runs down
            slopes, creating irregular patterns. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming droplets that eventually
            detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the color appear more muted. Aged contamination often has a matte
            finish due to surface oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. Thin films can produce iridescent
            effects.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as oxidation and polymerization
            occur. Over time, it can harden into a crusty or gummy residue. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or amorphous structure, depending on the specific additives and degradation products present. The surface can
            feel slightly rough due to accumulated particulate matter.
          thickness_range: From a thin film of 0.1-1 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or even exceeding
            1 mm in extreme cases. The thickness varies significantly depending on the location and duration of exposure.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (irregular flow patterns), pools/puddles (accumulation
            in low spots), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, hardened deposits), discrete patches (splashes
            or droplets), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (discoloration of the GaN surface), uniform coatings (rare,
            but possible with mist lubrication), and buildups (thick accumulations in specific areas).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to the nature
            of the contamination process (splashing, dripping, leaking). Uniformity is further disrupted by surface geometry,
            gravity, and airflow patterns. In controlled environments with mist lubrication, a more uniform, thin film may
            be observed initially, but this quickly degrades into a non-uniform pattern.
        galvanized steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light amber in color. Over time (weeks
            to months), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Dust and debris accumulate, creating a matte finish.
            After years, the buildup can harden into a thick, crusty layer that is difficult to remove. The color shifts towards
            darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and darkens over days. It begins at contact
            points (e.g., leaks) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often more pronounced at edges and in crevices. Layering
            effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate
            of oxidation and hardening. After months, the buildup becomes significantly thicker and more difficult to remove.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Dark amber to light brown (#A07A55)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish hues (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301919), potentially with a slight greenish tint from copper corrosion
            products if copper-containing additives are present in the oil.'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Exposed: Burnt umber (#8A3324) to black, often with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and seams. Splatter patterns are also frequently observed near machinery. A thin, uniform coating
            may initially form, but it quickly becomes uneven due to gravity and environmental factors.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The top surfaces of horizontal areas tend to accumulate more dust and debris, leading to
            a higher overall concentration of contaminants. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to
            gravity-induced flow.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, hardened crust, obscuring the original surface, significant accumulation. Thickness:
                > 1 mm.'
              visual: Galvanized steel completely obscured by a thick, black, crusty layer of oil/grease and accumulated debris.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating, significant buildup in crevices and corners, crusty texture. Thickness: 100
                μm - 1 mm.'
              visual: Galvanized steel almost entirely covered in a dark brown to black, thick, oily/greasy layer.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy coating, visible discoloration, some drip marks. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
              visual: Galvanized steel with a noticeable oily film and some streaks.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'More continuous coating, darker color, significant drip marks and pooling. Thickness: 10-100 μm.'
              visual: Galvanized steel largely covered in a brown, oily layer with visible drips and accumulations.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible film, slight discoloration, isolated spots. Thickness: < 1 μm.'
              visual: Mostly clean galvanized steel with a faint oily sheen in some areas.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on galvanized steel presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, barely visible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically dark brown to black, with variations
            depending on the oil type, age, and environmental conditions. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying
            areas due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), 2)
            Point source spreading (around leaks), 3) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), 4) Patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), 5) Streaky/linear (drip marks or wiping), 6) Localized concentrations (in crevices
            or corners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The liquid tends to 'wick' along edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced with higher viscosity oils and greases.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It may bridge small gaps due to its viscosity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop
            down slopes. Oil/grease hangs from overhead surfaces until the weight overcomes adhesion.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and accumulates dust,
            the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness
            of the buildup. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects, especially with certain
            additives.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged
            exposure and oxidation, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly brittle. Dust and debris often adhere to
            the surface, creating a rough, uneven texture. At a microscopic level, oxidation products can form a slightly
            crystalline structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in
            areas with continuous leakage or spillage.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged buildup),
            6) Discrete patches (splatters), 7) Stains (penetration into porous areas). Drip marks, thin films, and thick
            crusts are the most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, gravity, airflow, and the
            nature of the contamination source (e.g., leaks, splatters).
        germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, transparent film with a slight sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The surface may develop cracks
            and a crusty texture. The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks, often with localized areas of rust-orange
            due to oxidation of metallic components.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or lubrication points, then
            spreads outward. It may also begin at edges and move inward. The accumulation can be uniform and gradual, or it
            can originate from point sources that expand outward. Layering effects occur as new oil is deposited on top of
            older, oxidized layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber (#F0C808) or light brown (#A07A55) iridescent
            film. As it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), and eventually
            a near-black (#100C08) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from iron oxide contamination.
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots and streaks, especially near lubrication points or areas
            of mechanical wear. It tends to accumulate in crevices, corners, and along edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Drip marks are often visible on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to a thicker, darker layer. Corners
            and sheltered areas often have higher concentrations than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with
            higher concentrations at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A few scattered spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy film with some visible streaks and spots, thickness around 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous
            film with noticeable color variations and some thicker areas, thickness around 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            dark coating with significant buildup in crevices and edges, thickness around 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, dark, and crusty layer completely obscuring the underlying surface, thickness >100 μm up to several mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on germanium typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, dark brown or black deposit. The texture varies from smooth and oily to rough
            and crusty, depending on age and composition. Coverage patterns are often localized, with accumulation in crevices
            and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            and drip marks (on vertical surfaces). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This effect is particularly pronounced in corners and along sharp edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at edges,
            and follows contours. Depressions and gaps tend to fill with oil.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks from top to bottom. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            Oil runs down slopes and hangs from overhead surfaces. The angle of the surface directly affects the flow rate
            and accumulation pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits an iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of aged contamination. A glossy finish
            is common with fresh oil, transitioning to a matte finish as it ages and oxidizes. Rainbow effects can be observed
            in very thin films.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, oxidation and polymerization
            cause it to become sticky and then crusty. Depending on the presence of particulate matter (e.g., metal wear debris),
            the surface can feel rough and abrasive. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible to the naked eye) to several millimeters in areas
            of heavy buildup. A thin film might be 1-10 μm thick, while heavy buildup can reach 0.5-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or localized wear), stains (penetration into porous
            surfaces), and buildups (accumulation in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface finish, temperature gradients, airflow
            patterns, and the method of lubricant application.
        glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, glossy film with a light brown color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (almost black), and more matte in appearance. It can develop
            a hard, crusty surface and may exhibit cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., leaks) and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate contamination first, then the buildup moves
            inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point source expansion. Layering effects can occur with
            repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and polymerization.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination can appear as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As it
            ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), and eventually a near-black
            (#222222) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from metallic wear particles.
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in
            horizontal crevices, and accumulates around edges and joints. Point sources of leakage or spillage create radial
            patterns of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and joints are
            often areas of high concentration. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces accumulate pools.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): thin, patchy film,
            thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable coating with some bare areas, thickness 10-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            thick, dark coating with minimal bare areas, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): very thick, crusty buildup,
            thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on GFRP surfaces typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually dark brown or black, with variations depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas due to gravity
            and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (radial pattern from a leak), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven distribution due to surface irregularities), streaky/linear (drip marks on vertical surfaces), localized
            concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. It also concentrates in center areas of horizontal surfaces where pooling occurs. Uniform
            distribution is rare. The mechanism is related to the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. It accumulates in corners due to capillary
            action, builds up in crevices and depressions, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at edges
            due to surface tension, follows contours, and bridges small gaps. The sharper the corner, the greater the accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Hanging droplets can form from overhead surfaces. Flow rates
            can vary from 0.1 mm/s to 10 mm/s depending on viscosity and surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the darker, matte finish of aged contamination. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes
            be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry. Over
            time, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly crystalline due to the evaporation of volatile components
            and the polymerization of the remaining residue. It feels greasy initially, then becomes increasingly difficult
            to remove.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm or more
            in areas of prolonged leakage or accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (on inclined surfaces),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the GFRP matrix), uniform coatings
            (rare, only with controlled application), buildups (at joints and edges).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, gravity, airflow patterns, and the location
            of contamination sources.
        gneiss:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Aged contamination becomes
            thicker, darker, and more opaque. The surface texture changes from smooth to rough and crusty. Oxidation products
            can create a rust-colored staining effect. The buildup becomes increasingly difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins at contact points and spreads
            outward (days). Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices (days-weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation occurs
            on horizontal surfaces (weeks-months). Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns (weeks-months).
            Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events (months-years). Seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) with iridescent sheen. Days old: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484).
            Weeks old: Medium brown (#A0785A) with darker edges. Months old: Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#000000)
            in heavily soiled areas. Aged (years): Black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining from oxidation
            products.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often concentrated in crevices, along edges, and in areas where the gneiss surface
            is rough or porous. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more
            uniform coating. Point source contamination leads to radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces of horizontal areas tend to accumulate more contamination than top surfaces
            due to settling. Areas directly below a contamination source will have the highest concentration, decreasing with
            distance.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy coating, noticeable sheen (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coating, darker color, sticky
            texture (20-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating, crusty texture, significant discoloration (100-500
            μm). Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete encasement, very thick and dark, hard crust (500 μm - 1 mm+).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on gneiss presents as a mottled, often iridescent coating that darkens
            with age. Initially, it appears as a thin, glossy film, progressing to a thicker, tackier layer with embedded
            particulate matter. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to near-complete encasement, depending on the source
            and duration of exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (radial pattern), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution),
            streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick towards
            the edges, creating a higher concentration along the perimeter. This effect is more pronounced on smooth surfaces.
            In porous areas, the distribution may be more uniform.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices due to capillary action.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the gneiss surface. Fills depressions and low spots.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Horizontal surfaces experience settling
            of contaminants. Runs down slopes, creating streaks. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming stalactite-like
            formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen and potential iridescence.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making the buildup appear more matte. Aged contamination
            is generally less reflective and appears duller under all lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as oxidation occurs. Over time,
            it can develop a crusty or gummy texture due to polymerization and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Close
            inspection may reveal a slightly granular surface due to embedded particles. Aged deposits can be hard and brittle.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots
            (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), buildups (accumulations in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface roughness, porosity, and the direction of contaminant flow. Gravity and air currents also contribute
            to uneven distribution. The presence of crevices and edges further disrupts uniformity.
        gold:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Aged contamination
            becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The surface may develop a crusty or hardened texture. Color shifts from
            light amber to dark brown or black. Thickness increases significantly over time, potentially reaching millimeter
            scales.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours). 2) Accumulation
            begins at contact points and edges (days). 3) Spreading occurs from contact points and edges inward (days to weeks).
            4) Thickening of the film occurs gradually (weeks to months). 5) Oxidation and hardening lead to crust formation
            (months to years). 6) Layering effects may occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can influence the rate of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Iridescent sheen with light amber (#F0C808) hues. Days old: Dark amber to
            light brown (#A67B5B). Weeks old: Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges. Months old: Dark brown to almost black
            (#211E1E) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from oxidation products. Extreme aging: Black (#000000) with
            a dull, matte finish.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns are highly variable. Initially, a thin, almost invisible film may spread
            across the surface. Over time, accumulation occurs at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity.
            Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Point source contamination leads to radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more contamination than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Corners
            and low points act as collection sites. Exposed areas may experience some removal due to wiping or abrasion, leading
            to lighter contamination.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage with visible gold surface underneath. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage
            with some exposed gold. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick, opaque layer.
            Thickness: 50-250 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement with a very thick, often crusty layer. Thickness: >250
            μm, potentially reaching millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on gold presents as a viscous, often dark-colored coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a tacky texture. Coverage
            varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually only immediately after application).
            2) Edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (around lubrication points).
            4) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal).
            6) Streaky/linear (from wiping or dripping). 7) Localized concentrations (in crevices or low points). 8) Radial
            patterns (around a central contamination source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat surface. This effect is particularly
            pronounced in corners and along sharp edges. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially
            initially.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contamination accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to capillary action. Flat areas tend to pool the oil/grease. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks.
            Edges act as collection points. Contours influence flow patterns. Depressions fill with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in drip marks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling
            occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits an iridescent sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the amber or brown coloration more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, reducing
            reflectivity. The presence of metallic particles or oxidation products can create subtle iridescence or a dull
            metallic sheen.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With further aging and oxidation, it can develop a crusty or gummy surface. Microscopic examination may reveal
            a non-uniform surface with particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. The texture can range from a
            thin, easily smeared film to a thick, hardened layer.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-2 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A moderate layer is typically in the range of 25-250 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (from gravity
            or wiping). 3) Pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces or in depressions). 4) Thin films (initial contamination).
            5) Thick crusts (aged, oxidized buildup). 6) Discrete patches (uneven application). 7) Spots/dots (splatter or
            aerosol deposition). 8) Stains (penetration into porous surfaces, if present). 9) Uniform coatings (rare, immediately
            after application). 10) Buildups (localized accumulations).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is generally low to moderately patchy. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare
            except immediately after application. The presence of surface imperfections, variations in temperature, and gravitational
            forces contribute to non-uniformity. Aged contamination is almost always highly variable.
        gorilla glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light amber
            color. Aged contamination (months/years old) darkens to a dark brown or black, thickens significantly, and becomes
            more opaque. The texture changes from smooth to tacky or crusty. Oxidation products and accumulated debris contribute
            to the darker color and rougher texture.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, transparent film at contact points or
            edges (hours). 2) Spreads outward from these points, following surface contours (days). 3) Thickens gradually
            due to continued deposition and oxidation (weeks). 4) Accumulates in corners, crevices, and low-lying areas (months).
            5) Forms crusty, dark deposits with significant oxidation and debris accumulation (years). Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F8DE7E) with slight iridescence'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3E2723) with blackening due to oxidation'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Black (#000000) in extreme cases'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include streaks from downward flow, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and pooling
            in low-lying areas or crevices. Accumulation is often observed around edges and corners due to surface tension
            effects. Point source contamination leads to radial spreading patterns. Uniform coatings are rare unless the glass
            is submerged or sprayed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier concentrations
            due to surface tension. Bottom edges of vertical surfaces accumulate drips. Crevices and low-lying areas trap
            oil/grease. Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate a more uniform layer. Sheltered areas may have higher concentrations
            than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning or weathering.

              description: 'Barely visible, isolated spots or streaks. Thickness: <1 μm'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Gorilla Glass typically presents as a non-uniform, slightly iridescent
            film that ranges in color from light amber to dark brown, depending on age and thickness. The texture varies from
            a smooth, oily sheen when fresh to a tacky, slightly rough surface as it ages and oxidizes. Coverage patterns
            are often influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to streaks, drips, and localized accumulations.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (most common), 2) Point source
            spreading (common near lubrication points), 3) Streaky/linear (due to gravity and flow), 4) Localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points), 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or removal), 6) Gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat center surface. While some uniform
            distribution can occur, edge accumulation is the dominant behavior. Random distribution is less common unless
            the contamination is applied as a fine mist or spray.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas. It drips on vertical surfaces. It collects
            at edges. It follows contours. It can bridge small gaps. It fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to surface
            tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight oily sheen and iridescence. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Heavily aged deposits tend to have a matte
            finish due to oxidation and surface roughness. Rainbow effects can be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels oily and smooth to the touch. As it ages, it becomes tacky and slightly
            rough due to oxidation and polymerization. Heavily aged deposits can be crusty and hard, sometimes exhibiting
            a slight graininess or particulate texture from accumulated debris. The surface is generally not crystalline or
            powdery unless exposed to extreme heat or chemical reactions.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or
            even thicker in extreme cases. Heavily aged deposits can reach thicknesses of 1-2 mm in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces or crevices), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (heavily
            aged deposits), 6) Discrete patches (uneven application), 7) Spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), 8) Stains
            (penetration into surface imperfections).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by application method, surface geometry, gravity, and environmental
            factors. Areas near lubrication points or exposed to direct spray tend to have higher concentrations.
        granite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, almost invisible film. Over time, it oxidizes and polymerizes,
            becoming darker, thicker, and more viscous. Aged contamination often forms a hard, crusty layer that is difficult
            to remove. The color shifts from light brown to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin, almost invisible film that spreads outward from the source. Over time, it
            thickens and darkens, accumulating in crevices and low-lying areas. Begins at contact points and spreads. Layering
            effects occur as new contamination is deposited on top of older layers. Seasonal variations may occur due to changes
            in temperature and humidity. Timeframe: Hours (thin film), Days (visible discoloration), Weeks (noticeable buildup),
            Months (thick crust).'

            old: Black (#000000) with possible greyish (#808080) areas due to dust accumulation and oxidation.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near machinery, streaks from dripping or splashing, accumulation in crevices and
            joints, and a general darkening of the granite surface. Accumulation is often heavier near the source of the contamination
            and decreases with distance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier near the source of the contamination, in crevices and
            low-lying areas, and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical surfaces tend to have streaks and drip marks. Edges and
            corners may accumulate more contamination due to surface tension effects.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, very thin film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%): Thin
            film with some visible discoloration (5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration and buildup in crevices
            (25-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant buildup (100 μm - 1 mm). Extreme (>85%): Thick,
            encrusted layer covering most of the surface (1 mm+).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on granite presents as a multi-layered coating, ranging from a thin,
            iridescent sheen to a thick, dark, and sticky accumulation. The color is typically dark brown or black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas,
            creating a mottled or streaked appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around machinery), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to splashing), streaky/linear (due to dripping),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (in areas with constant exposure).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is especially true on horizontal surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas. Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges. Follows contours of the granite surface. Fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs
            at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits an iridescent sheen under direct light, especially sunlight. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting reveals the darker tones and textures more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish due to dust accumulation and oxidation.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Days old: Sticky and slightly tacky. Weeks old:
            Viscous and gummy. Months/Years old: Hardened, crusty, and potentially brittle. May contain embedded particulate
            matter (dust, metal shavings). Surface can be smooth or rough depending on the age and exposure.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-100 μm. Moderate buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm. Heavy buildup:
            1 mm - 5 mm or more. Varies by conditions.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks, runs/streaks, pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films, thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (splashes), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into the granite pores), and buildups
            (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface texture, exposure to the contaminant, and cleaning practices. Areas near the source of contamination
            tend to have higher concentrations.
        hafnium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, light-colored film. Over time, it darkens due to oxidation
            and thermal degradation, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface becomes rougher and may develop a crusty
            texture. Aged deposits are significantly harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges. It then thickens
            over time due to continuous exposure and oxidation. The contamination begins at edges and gradually moves inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in enclosed environments. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects can occur with intermittent exposure. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup. Timeframe: Hours - barely visible film. Days - noticeable discoloration.
            Weeks - distinct coating. Months - significant buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C27B), almost transparent. Days old: Yellowish-brown (#A07A3D).
            Weeks old: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish undertones. Months old: Black (#000000) with possible iridescent
            sheen. Heavily oxidized: Dark reddish-brown (#800000).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, uniform coating on
            surfaces exposed to oil mist, accumulation in crevices and corners, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Often
            forms a gradient, with thicker deposits closer to the source of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier near the source of contamination (e.g., lubrication
            points). Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more oil due to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces
            may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal
            surfaces accumulate pooled oil.

            tar-like deposit, >500 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Hafnium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color varies from light amber to dark
            brown/black, depending on age and exposure. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas due to gravity
            and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication fittings), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splashing), streaky/linear
            (from drips or runs), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (in enclosed environments with
            oil mist).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The edges act as collection points, and the oil tends to spread along the perimeter.
            Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially if exposed to oil mist.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas, drips
            on vertical surfaces, and collects at edges. It follows contours and bridges small gaps. Depressions and machined
            features act as collection points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Oil pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes and hangs
            from overhead surfaces. The angle of the surface directly affects the rate of accumulation and the formation of
            drip marks.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil exhibits a glossy sheen under direct lighting. As it ages and oxidizes, the sheen diminishes,
            and the surface becomes more matte. Heavily oxidized deposits may exhibit a slight iridescence due to thin-film
            interference effects, especially under bright, direct light. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the
            appearance, making subtle color variations less noticeable.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth. Aged: Tacky, sticky, and increasingly rough. Heavily oxidized:
            Hard, crusty, and potentially brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the
            grease matrix. Can feel slightly gritty due to wear debris.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flowing oil),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (from oxidation and polymerization),
            discrete patches (from splashing), spots/dots (from oil mist), stains (from absorbed oil), and uniform coatings
            (in enclosed environments).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible in enclosed systems with consistent oil mist. Moderately patchy is common due to splashing or uneven
            application. Highly variable/irregular is typical in open environments with inconsistent exposure. Concentration
            is often concentrated near the source of contamination.
        hastelloy:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time, it darkens in color, thickens, and
            becomes more viscous. Aged contamination often exhibits a matte finish and a hardened, crusty texture. Thermal
            degradation can lead to carbonization and the formation of a hard, black residue.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or lubrication
            points. It then spreads outward, thickening over time. Edges tend to accumulate oil/grease faster than center
            areas. The accumulation can be gradual and uniform, or it can occur in distinct layers due to intermittent contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup. Within hours, a thin film
            is visible. Within days, the film thickens and becomes more viscous. Within months, a crusty deposit can form.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#FFBF00) with a slight greenish tint due to additives.'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Light brown (#A07A5F) with a matte finish.'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges and increased viscosity.'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to black (#301900) with a hardened, crusty texture.'
          - 'Thermally Degraded: Black (#000000) with a brittle, carbonized appearance.'
          common_patterns: Distribution patterns are highly dependent on the orientation of the Hastelloy surface and the
            source of the contamination. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low points and
            crevices, and a general accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Edges and corners tend to accumulate thicker deposits
            due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly depending on the location. Edges and corners tend to
            have heavier deposits due to surface tension. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low
            points act as collection areas. Flat horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Very thick, crusty deposit. Obscured surface details. Thickness > 100 μm, often exceeding 1 mm.
              visual_appearance: Hastelloy surface completely obscured by a thick, dark layer of oil/grease. The original
                surface is no longer visible.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Thick, viscous coating. Significant discoloration and buildup. Thickness 25-100 μm.
              visual_appearance: Hastelloy surface almost completely covered with a thick layer of oil/grease. Surface details
                are obscured.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Thin, discontinuous film. Visible streaks and droplets. Thickness 1-5 μm.
              visual_appearance: Hastelloy surface with a thin, patchy coating of oil/grease. Some areas are still clean.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Continuous film with some thicker areas. Noticeable discoloration. Thickness 5-25 μm.
              visual_appearance: Hastelloy surface largely covered with oil/grease. Color is noticeably darker than clean
                metal.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated droplets or thin streaks. Barely visible film. Thickness < 1 μm.
              visual_appearance: Mostly clean Hastelloy surface with scattered, faint traces of oil/grease.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Hastelloy typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges
            in color from amber to dark brown or black depending on age and thermal exposure. The texture is generally sticky
            and can range from a thin, oily film to a thick, crusty deposit. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to
            localized accumulations in crevices and low points.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent application or splashing),
            streaky/linear (drip marks on vertical surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices and low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker deposit. Center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform film. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges and follows
            contours. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions. Sharp edges tend to have higher concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and low points. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging droplets can form on overhead surfaces. The angle of the surface
            directly affects the flow rate and accumulation pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and oxidizes, the
            sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Thermally degraded deposits may appear dull and non-reflective.
            The color appears more saturated under direct light and muted under diffuse lighting.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slippery. As the oil oxidizes and degrades, it becomes sticky
            and tacky. With prolonged exposure and thermal cycling, it hardens into a crusty, sometimes brittle, deposit.
            Close inspection may reveal a slightly granular or uneven surface due to the presence of solid additives and wear
            debris. It feels smooth when fresh, but rough and uneven when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Heavily loaded areas can reach thicknesses of 10mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches
            (splashes or localized leaks), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform
            coatings (rare), buildups (at joints and seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, the viscosity of the oil/grease,
            and the surface geometry. Spray applications tend to be more uniform than manual applications.
        hickory:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film that is easily wiped away. Aged contamination
            becomes thicker, darker, and more difficult to remove. The surface may develop a cracked or crazed appearance
            due to repeated expansion and contraction. Oxidation products contribute to a dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges. It then spreads outward, thickening
            over time. Point sources expand radially. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup. The process starts within hours, becomes
            noticeable within days, and significant buildup occurs over months.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, close to Munsell 2.5Y 6/4 (#DBC18F)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown, #A0785A (similar to raw umber)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown, #654321 (chocolate brown)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Blackish-brown, #332200, often with a reddish tint due to oxidation'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Exposed: Dark reddish-brown, #800000 (maroon)'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is most pronounced in areas where oil can pool or drip. This includes edges, corners,
            crevices, and horizontal surfaces. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks. Around point sources of leakage,
            a radial spreading pattern is common. In areas subject to frequent wiping, the buildup may be more uniform but
            thinner.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            pooling. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more oil than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Sheltered areas
            accumulate more oil than exposed areas due to reduced evaporation and weathering. Top surfaces may have less accumulation
            due to dripping onto lower surfaces.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'

              description: Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration.
              thickness: <10 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on hickory presents as a darkening of the wood surface, ranging from
            subtle amber discoloration to a thick, dark brown or black coating. The texture varies from a smooth, slightly
            tacky film to a hardened, crusty layer depending on age and exposure. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with
            accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (oil wicks to edges due to surface
            tension), point source spreading (radial pattern from leak), drip marks (vertical streaks), localized concentrations
            (pooling in low spots), and patchy/spotty coverage (uneven application or cleaning).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a darker outline. This effect is less pronounced on
            perfectly smooth surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas
            allow oil to pool. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act as barriers, preventing oil from spreading further.
            Depressions fill with oil. Contours guide the flow of oil.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity. Horizontal surfaces experience settling of oil.
            Slopes exhibit runs. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged buildup tends to
            have a matte finish due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the
            unevenness of the coating. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface feels oily and slightly tacky. Over time, exposure to air and heat causes
            the oil to oxidize and polymerize, leading to a sticky, then gummy, and eventually a hard, crusty texture. Fine
            dust and debris often adhere to the surface, creating a rough, sandpaper-like feel. The hickory grain may be obscured
            by heavy buildup.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a monomolecular layer (<1 μm) in freshly wiped areas to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) in areas of heavy accumulation. Typical thicknesses in moderately contaminated areas are in the range
            of 25-500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow), pools/puddles
            (accumulation in depressions), thin films (uniform coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (isolated
            areas), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into wood), and buildups (layered accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the surface has been deliberately coated. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in
            surface roughness, gravity, temperature gradients, and cleaning practices.
        inconel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a glossy sheen. Over time, it darkens
            in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination often forms a hard, crusty layer that is difficult
            to remove. Oxidation and polymerization reactions contribute to the hardening and darkening process. The surface
            may become dull and matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually
            over days and weeks, especially at contact points and edges. The contamination may begin at edges and then move
            inward, or it may start from point sources and expand outward. Layering effects can occur as new contamination
            is deposited on top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the
            rate of buildup and oxidation. Significant buildup can occur within months, leading to thick, hardened deposits.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Translucent amber (#FFBF00 to #FF8000), sometimes with a slight greenish
            hue due to additives. Aged contamination (days/weeks): Dark amber to burnt orange (#A36209 to #B7410E), becoming
            more opaque. Heavily oxidized/aged contamination (months/years): Dark brown to black (#301900 to #000000), often
            with a matte finish. Under high heat, can exhibit a bluish-grey tint due to thermal degradation of hydrocarbons.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks are common, especially near lubrication points or areas of mechanical
            wear. Drip marks are frequently observed on vertical surfaces. Accumulation in crevices, threads, and around fasteners
            is typical. A thin, uniform film may cover larger areas, especially in enclosed environments.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Crevices and threads act as traps for oil and grease. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform distribution, but
            can also accumulate thicker deposits due to gravity. Vertical walls show drip marks and streaks, with higher concentrations
            at the bottom. Sheltered areas tend to accumulate more contamination than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning
            action from airflow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, discontinuous film with isolated spots. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Visual
            appearance: Barely visible, slight sheen. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film with some streaks and spots. Thickness:
            5-15 μm. Visual appearance: Noticeable sheen, slight discoloration. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous film with
            thicker deposits in some areas. Thickness: 15-50 μm. Visual appearance: Darker color, noticeable buildup. Heavy
            (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating with significant buildup in crevices and corners. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Visual
            appearance: Opaque, dark color, crusty texture. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, hardened deposits covering most of
            the surface. Thickness: >200 μm. Visual appearance: Black, tar-like, heavily encrusted.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Inconel typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color varies from translucent amber to opaque black,
            depending on age, temperature, and contaminant concentration. Coverage patterns are often non-uniform, with preferential
            accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Point source spreading (radial pattern from a lubrication
            point). 2. Streaky/linear (along sliding surfaces or drip paths). 3. Localized concentrations (in crevices and
            around fasteners). 4. Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source). 5. Patchy/spotty
            (uneven distribution due to inconsistent application or environmental factors).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The edges act as barriers, preventing the oil/grease from spreading further. The
            center areas may have a thinner, more uniform film, especially if the surface is relatively flat and smooth. However,
            pooling can occur in the center if there is a depression or low spot.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil and grease accumulate in corners and
            crevices due to surface tension. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks.
            Edges act as barriers, causing buildup along the perimeter. Contours influence the flow and distribution of the
            contaminant. Depressions fill with oil and grease. Gaps can be bridged by viscous deposits.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical
            streaking is a common phenomenon. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs develop
            down slopes. Oil and grease can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen and may display iridescent
            rainbow effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more
            opaque areas of aged contamination. The surface can appear matte or slightly reflective depending on the degree
            of oxidation and surface roughness.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and viscous to the touch. Aged: Becomes sticky and tacky, eventually hardening
            into a crusty or tar-like consistency. Can exhibit a smooth, glossy surface when fresh, transitioning to a matte
            or slightly rough surface with age and oxidation. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter embedded
            within the grease matrix.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm or more. Extreme buildup can exceed several millimeters, forming thick, hardened deposits.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (initial layer of contamination). 2. Drip marks (vertical
            streaks from gravity). 3. Runs/streaks (horizontal or angled streaks from fluid flow). 4. Pools/puddles (accumulation
            in low-lying areas). 5. Thick crusts (hardened deposits from oxidation and polymerization). 6. Discrete patches
            (isolated areas of contamination). 7. Spots/dots (small, localized deposits). 8. Stains (discoloration of the
            Inconel surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly depending on the application method and operating conditions.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations is possible in enclosed systems with
            consistent lubrication. Moderately patchy is common in areas with localized wear or contamination sources. Highly
            variable/irregular is typical in open environments with inconsistent lubrication and exposure to contaminants.
            Concentration is often higher near lubrication points and areas of mechanical wear.
        indium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, almost invisible film with a slight sheen. Over time (days
            to weeks), it darkens in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. After months to years, it hardens into a thick,
            crusty layer that is difficult to remove. Oxidation can lead to a rust-orange discoloration mixed with the dark
            brown residue.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and darkens over days. It often begins
            at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point
            source expansion. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent with a slight yellow tint (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484) with iridescent sheen'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#A0785A) with darker edges'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E) with a matte finish'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-orange (#B7410E) mixed with dark brown (#301E1E) in severe cases'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly starts as a thin film, often accumulating in low points, edges, and crevices
            due to capillary action and gravity. It can also originate from point sources, spreading outwards in a radial
            pattern. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to capillary action
            and gravity. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more buildup than vertical surfaces. Exposed areas may experience
            some evaporation, leading to a slightly different composition compared to sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete encasement in a thick, crusty layer. Thickness: >500 μm.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating that significantly obscures the underlying surface. Thickness: 50-500 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable brown or amber coating, partially obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: 5-50
                μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or thin films, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Indium presents as a viscous, often iridescent film that progresses
            to a thicker, tacky coating. The color ranges from a light amber to a dark, almost black, residue depending on
            age and exposure. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement, often with noticeable accumulation
            in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubricant application points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven surface coverage), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: The buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            This is the most common behavior. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there
            compared to the center.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges, following contours.
            It may bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, but less common due to the viscous
            nature of the oil/grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits an iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a
            matte finish, reducing reflectivity.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy residue. Close inspection reveals a non-uniform surface with varying
            degrees of smoothness and roughness, often containing particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Extreme cases can reach up to 5 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (in low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into porous surfaces),
            and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, and
            the method of lubricant application.
        indium phosphide:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, transparent film with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Thickens, darkens in color (amber to brown), and becomes more viscous. Oxidation and polymerization
            lead to a harder, more brittle texture. Dust and debris become embedded, further darkening the appearance.'
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks) due to continued application
            or accumulation. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate
            first, then the contamination moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; point sources and edge effects
            are more common. Layering effects can occur with repeated applications of different types of oil/grease. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to pale yellow (#FFFFE0). Aged contamination: Dark
            amber (#D4A017) to reddish-brown (#A0522D). Heavily oxidized/burnt: Dark brown (#8B4513) to almost black (#000000)
            in extreme cases. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown hue (#808000).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, accumulation in low-lying
            areas due to gravity, and a general coating on exposed surfaces. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more due
            to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Edges and corners tend to have heavier concentrations due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying areas trap oil and grease. Exposed
            areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or removal by airflow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, thickness <0.1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy
            film, thickness 0.1-1 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, thickness 1-10 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, uneven
            layer, thickness 10-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Indium Phosphide typically appears as a non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a barely visible sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from light amber to dark brown, depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating distinct
            patterns.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or removal), streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), and localized concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects. The oil/grease tends to
            'wet' the edges more readily than the flat surfaces. Capillary action draws the contaminant towards the perimeter.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the surface. Fills depressions and low spots.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is significant, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers.
            Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming
            droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: 'Direct sunlight: Highlights the oily sheen of fresh contamination and reveals the unevenness
            of the coating. Indoor fluorescent: May appear more matte, with less pronounced sheen. Thick buildup can exhibit
            specular reflection, creating bright spots. Iridescence can occur in very thin films due to interference effects.'
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, smooth, and slightly sticky. Aged: Tacky, viscous, and may exhibit a slightly crusty
            or gummy texture. Heavily oxidized: Hard, brittle, and potentially flaky. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate
            matter (wear debris, oxidation products) embedded within the grease.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 0.1-1 μm (barely visible). Moderate buildup: 1-25 μm. Heavy buildup: 25-500 μm or more.
            Extreme buildup can reach several millimeters in localized areas.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (general coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots
            (splatter), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), and buildups (accumulation in specific areas).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface roughness, temperature gradients, and the method of application. Gravity and airflow also contribute
            to non-uniformity.
        iridium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, oily film with a slight amber or yellow tint.
            Aged contamination (months/years) darkens significantly, becoming a thick, dark brown or black crust. The texture
            evolves from smooth and oily to hard and brittle. Oxidation products contribute to a rust-orange or reddish-brown
            discoloration in some areas. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or lubrication
            points. It then spreads outward, gradually thickening over time. Buildup often begins at edges and then moves
            inward. The accumulation can be uniform and gradual, or it can occur from point sources that expand outward. Layering
            effects can be observed as new oil deposits on top of older, hardened layers. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can influence the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with subtle yellow-brown tint (#D2B48C)'
          - 'Lightly Aged: Light brown (#A67B5B) with hints of amber (#FFBF00) in thinner areas'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges and potential rust-orange (#B7410E) spots due to oxidation'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black (#301900) with a matte finish and possible green/blue iridescence in very thin
            areas due to thin-film interference'
          - 'Extreme Buildup: Black (#000000) with a hardened, crusty texture and potential for embedded particulate matter'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, especially on vertical surfaces.
            It tends to accumulate first in crevices, edges, and areas where oil can pool. On horizontal surfaces, it can
            form a more uniform coating, although often with variations in thickness. Point source spreading from lubrication
            points is also common.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to capillary action
            and surface tension. Top surfaces exposed to direct oil application or splashing will have higher concentrations
            than sheltered areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity-induced flow. Horizontal
            surfaces can have relatively uniform coverage, but with thicker accumulations in low spots.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete coverage with a thick, hardened crust and significant accumulation. Thickness: >250 μm.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating with significant buildup and crust formation. Thickness: 50-250 μm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable coating with darker areas and some buildup in crevices. Thickness: 10-50 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on iridium typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the
            oil's composition, age, and environmental conditions, but generally exhibits a sticky or tacky texture and accumulates
            preferentially in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces), edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (on vertical surfaces due to gravity), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas.
            This effect is particularly pronounced in corners and crevices. Uniform distribution is rare, and the center areas
            typically have a thinner film compared to the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker
            layers. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, forming a bead-like buildup. It
            follows contours, creating variations in thickness. It bridges gaps, forming solid connections between surfaces.
            It fills depressions, creating smooth, filled areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low spots on horizontal surfaces. Vertical
            streaking is a common phenomenon. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers. Runs down slopes,
            creating a gradient in thickness. Can hang from overhead surfaces, forming drips.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit a noticeable sheen and can display iridescent rainbow
            effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte appearance
            of aged deposits. The glossiness decreases with age as the oil oxidizes and hardens.
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup is oily and smooth to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or waxy texture. Microscopic examination reveals a complex structure with embedded
            particles, oxidation products, and potentially crystalline structures formed by additives like ZDDP. The surface
            can range from smooth and glossy to rough and matte, depending on the thickness and age of the deposit.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (iridescent film) to several millimeters (heavy buildup).
            Typical ranges: Thin film: <1 μm, Light buildup: 1-25 μm, Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm, Heavy buildup: 250 μm -
            2 mm, Extreme buildup: >2 mm.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (on vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (due to localized wear or contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration
            into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil application. Gravity also plays a significant role in creating uneven
            distribution, especially on vertical surfaces.
        iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, light-colored film. Over time, it darkens due to oxidation
            and thermal degradation, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface texture changes from smooth to rough and
            crusty. Aged buildup often incorporates dust, dirt, and wear debris, further darkening the color and increasing
            the roughness.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks due to continued application and
            accumulation. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads outward. Starts at edges and moves
            inward, filling crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation can occur on submerged surfaces. Point sources expand outward,
            creating a radial pattern. Layering effects occur with repeated applications. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#F0C808) or light brown (#A07A5F). Moderately Aged: Dark brown (#654321)
            with reddish-brown (#B7410E) oxidation spots. Heavily Aged: Black (#000000) or very dark brown (#301919) with
            possible greyish (#808080) dust accumulation. Oxidized: Rust-orange (#D2691E) mixed with dark brown.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running, uniform coating on submerged
            or enclosed surfaces, accumulation in crevices and corners, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Often a gradient
            of thickness and color from the source of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier near the source of contamination (e.g., lubrication
            points). Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more buildup than flat surfaces. Bottom surfaces and low points
            collect oil/grease due to gravity. Sheltered areas may have thicker buildup than exposed areas due to less cleaning
            or weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Thin
            film with some visible patches, thickness < 5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with varying thickness,
            5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque layer covering most of the surface, 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick,
            crusty buildup completely obscuring the original surface, >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on iron presents as a complex, multi-layered coating. Initially, it appears
            as a thin, translucent film, progressing to a thicker, opaque layer with a dark, often brownish or blackish hue.
            The texture varies from smooth and oily to rough and crusty, depending on age and environmental conditions, and
            coverage is rarely uniform, favoring edges and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication fittings), gradient
            from source (thicker near the source, thinner further away), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splashing),
            streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points), and uniform coating
            (on submerged parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to surface tension effects,
            which cause the oil/grease to be drawn towards edges and corners. Capillary action also contributes to accumulation
            in crevices. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming
            a thicker layer. It follows contours, creating a visible pattern. It can bridge gaps, forming a continuous layer
            across discontinuities.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a thicker layer. It runs
            down slopes, creating a gradient of thickness. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like
            formations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy or semi-glossy sheen, reflecting light. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Direct sunlight can highlight the oily sheen of fresh contamination, while indoor
            fluorescent lighting may emphasize the darker, matte appearance of aged buildup. Iridescence can occur in very
            thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, and slippery to the touch. Moderately Aged: Sticky, slightly tacky, with
            a soft, almost waxy feel. Heavily Aged: Hard, crusty, and rough, sometimes with a granular or crystalline texture
            due to oxidation and polymerization. May contain embedded particulate matter.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters in thickness.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flowing oil/grease), pools/puddles (in
            low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (splashes or spills),
            spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (submerged parts), and
            buildups (accumulated layers).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is most common. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due
            to variations in application, gravity, temperature gradients, and surface geometry. Uniformity is more likely
            on submerged or enclosed surfaces where the oil/grease can spread evenly.
        kevlar-reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens, thickens,
            and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination can harden into a brittle, crusty layer, often with a matte finish
            and a darker, almost black color. Oxidation products may create a reddish-brown staining effect on the underlying
            polymer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days. It often begins at
            contact points or lubrication points then spreads outwards. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward, or
            it can be a more uniform gradual accumulation. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#966F33). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to almost black (#222222) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from oxidation products.
            Heat-affected areas may exhibit a bluish-black sheen.'
          common_patterns: The buildup often starts as localized spots near lubrication points or areas of high friction.
            It then spreads outwards, forming streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is common in crevices,
            corners, and along edges due to capillary action and gravity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices due to capillary
            action and gravity. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with heavier accumulation at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces
            collect more debris than vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas may accumulate more contamination than exposed areas
            due to reduced cleaning action from airflow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Patchy distribution with a thin film, noticeable discoloration, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Significant coverage with visible buildup in crevices and along edges, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Near-complete
            coverage with a thick, viscous layer, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with a thick, hardened
            crust, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Kevlar-reinforced polymer typically presents as a dark, viscous coating
            that ranges in color from amber to dark brown. The texture is generally sticky and uneven, with coverage varying
            from localized spots to a near-uniform film, often accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution), streaky/linear
            (due to flow), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (rare, but possible in enclosed environments).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension effects. The edges provide a higher surface area for the oil to adhere to. Center areas
            tend to have thinner, more uniform coverage, unless there is a direct source of contamination in the center.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, and follows contours. Sharp edges tend to concentrate the buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease can
            hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            may reveal subtle color variations and surface irregularities. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish,
            reducing reflectivity. Oil films can exhibit iridescence (rainbow effect) when very thin (1-10 μm).
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, becoming increasingly sticky and tacky as oxidation
            occurs. Over time, a crusty or hardened surface layer may form, especially in areas exposed to high temperatures
            or UV radiation. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or particulate structure due to the presence of
            wear debris and oxidation byproducts.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) in areas with minimal contamination to a heavy buildup
            (0.1-2 mm) in areas of high accumulation. Crusty deposits can reach thicknesses of 5 mm or more in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the polymer matrix), and
            buildups (around joints and seals).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, airflow
            patterns, and the location of lubrication points.
        lanthanum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (weeks/months), it darkens, thickens,
            and loses its gloss. The surface becomes dull, cracked, and may exhibit signs of oxidation, such as reddish-brown
            discoloration. The aged buildup is significantly harder and more difficult to remove than fresh contamination.
          buildup_progression: The buildup progression starts as a thin, iridescent film within hours of exposure. Over days,
            it thickens and darkens, concentrating at contact points and edges. After weeks, the buildup spreads inward from
            the edges, forming a more uniform (but still uneven) coating. Months of exposure lead to layering effects, with
            older, hardened layers covered by newer, fresher contamination. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect
            the viscosity and flow of the oil/grease, influencing the rate and pattern of buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with subtle yellow-brown tones (#D2B48C)'
          - 'Light Buildup: Dark amber (#795548) with a slight gloss'
          - 'Moderate Buildup: Burnt umber (#8A3324) to dark brown (#3E2723)'
          - 'Heavy Buildup: Black (#000000) with matte finish'
          - 'Aged Buildup: Dull, cracked black (#212121) with possible reddish-brown oxidation products (#A52A2A) around edges'
          common_patterns: Buildup often starts at edges and crevices due to capillary action and gravity. It then spreads
            across flat surfaces, forming a non-uniform coating. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Accumulation
            is typically heavier in areas with higher exposure to the oil/grease source.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravity and capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to dripping. Corners
            and sheltered areas tend to accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient
            from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to downward flow.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Complete encasement in a thick, black crust. The original surface is entirely hidden.
              thickness: '>1 mm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Near-complete coverage with a dark brown to black coloration. The original surface is largely obscured.
              thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Patchy distribution with visible amber to light brown coloration. Drip marks may be present.
              thickness: 1-10 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Significant coverage with a darker brown coloration. The surface texture is noticeably altered.
              thickness: 10-100 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Appears as a slight discoloration or sheen.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Lanthanum typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a dark brown to black
            coloration. Coverage varies from localized spots to near-complete surface encasement, depending on exposure and
            time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (radiating outwards from a leak or application point), drip marks (vertical streaks from gravity),
            patchy/spotty distribution (uneven application or localized contamination), and uniform coating (less common,
            but possible with spray application). Edge accumulation and drip marks are the most prevalent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center
            areas. While the center may have a thin film, the edges will exhibit a more pronounced buildup.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Edges
            act as collection points. The buildup tends to follow contours and fill depressions. Gaps and small openings can
            be bridged by the viscous material.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Buildup can hang from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like
            structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight iridescent sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the amber to brown coloration more clearly. Aged buildup tends to have a matte finish, reducing
            reflectivity. The presence of metallic wear debris can create a subtle metallic sheen in heavily contaminated
            areas.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, the texture evolves to become sticky and viscous. With aging and oxidation,
            it hardens, becoming crusty and potentially brittle. Close inspection may reveal a fine, granular structure due
            to the presence of additives and wear debris. Feels tacky to the touch, eventually becoming hard and flaky.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of severe accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), and stains (penetration into the Lanthanum surface). Drip marks and thin films
            are the most common initial formations.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity arises from variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, and the
            method of oil/grease application. Gravity also plays a significant role in creating uneven distribution.
        lead:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time, it darkens, thickens, and becomes
            more matte. Aged contamination often exhibits a cracked or crazed surface due to drying and oxidation. The color
            shifts from brown to black, and the texture becomes harder and more brittle. Thickness increases significantly
            over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin film, often almost invisible. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation is
            rare; it''s usually uneven. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with repeated applications
            or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and drying. Timeframe:
            Hours (thin film), Days (visible coating), Weeks (noticeable buildup), Months (thick, hardened deposits).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #8B4513 (Saddle Brown), almost translucent. Days old: #654321 (Dark Chocolate),
            slightly opaque. Weeks old: #4A3020 (Dark Coffee), matte finish. Months old: #282828 (Charcoal Gray) to #000000
            (Black), hardened and potentially cracked. Heavily oxidized: #544B48 (Dark Taupe) with a slight reddish tint due
            to lead oxide interaction.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running, accumulation in crevices
            and corners, and a general coating on exposed surfaces. The buildup is often uneven, with thicker deposits in
            areas where oil/grease has pooled or dripped. Edges and seams are prime accumulation zones.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low-lying areas also accumulate more oil/grease. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks,
            while horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform pooling. Sheltered areas may have thicker deposits due to
            reduced exposure to cleaning or wear.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible accumulation in crevices. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with visible drip marks and pooling. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, uneven coating with
            significant buildup in low-lying areas. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with thick, hardened
            deposits. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on lead typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging from a
            thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, tarry accumulation. The color is generally dark brown to black, with
            variations depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying
            areas due to gravity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication fittings), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (due
            to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in low spots or crevices), and edge accumulation (due to surface
            tension).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas. This effect is more pronounced
            on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the surface. Fills depressions and low spots.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is prominent on vertical and sloped surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and low-lying areas. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces,
            leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes, creating visible flow patterns. Hanging from overhead surfaces
            is possible, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the coating. Aged contamination typically has a matte finish and
            reflects less light. The presence of metallic particles in the grease can create small specular reflections.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and easily smeared. Days old: Sticky and viscous, with a slight tackiness.
            Weeks old: Tacky to the touch, with a slight crust forming on the surface. Months old: Hardened, crusty, and potentially
            cracked. The surface can be smooth or rough depending on the accumulation thickness and environmental conditions.
            May contain embedded particulate matter.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm. These are approximate ranges and vary significantly based on operating conditions
            and maintenance practices.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches (localized application),
            spots/dots (splatter or mist), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare, usually intentional
            application), buildups (accumulation over time).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to the nature
            of oil/grease application, gravity, and surface irregularities. The level of uniformity depends on the application
            method, the viscosity of the oil/grease, and the operating environment.
        lead crystal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, transparent film, barely noticeable except for a slight
            reduction in clarity. Aged contamination becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The surface transitions from
            glossy to matte. Cracking and crazing may occur in heavily contaminated areas due to thermal stress and oxidation.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges, within hours of exposure.
            It then thickens and spreads over days. Over weeks, it begins to oxidize and darken. Over months, it can form
            a thick, crusty layer, especially in areas exposed to heat. Layering effects may occur if there are intermittent
            contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) with a slight greenish tint due to ZDDP. Days old:
            Yellowish-brown (#C4A484). Weeks old: Medium brown (#A0785A) with hints of rust-orange (#B7410E) from oxidation.
            Months old: Dark brown (#654321) with blackish patches from carbonization. Heavily oxidized: Reddish-brown (#8B4513)
            with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: The buildup often starts at edges and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            then spreads across flat surfaces, forming a thin film. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces.
            Areas exposed to higher temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action. Top
            surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas often accumulate
            more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with heavier concentrations at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a slight sheen or discoloration. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film, slightly reduces clarity. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable film, distinct
            discoloration. Thickness: 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque coating, significantly reduces clarity. Thickness: 50-500
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup, completely obscures the surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on lead crystal typically presents as a viscous, often iridescent film
            that dulls the crystal's inherent clarity. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on the age
            and composition of the contaminant. Initial buildup tends to be localized, spreading over time to form a more
            uniform, albeit uneven, coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from fluid flow), and localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: The buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The perimeter is often more heavily contaminated than the center areas. This is especially true for standing liquids
            or areas where cleaning is difficult.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips occur on vertical surfaces. The contamination collects at edges, following
            contours and filling depressions. It may bridge small gaps due to its viscous nature.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. The contamination
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming
            small droplets.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight iridescence or rainbow effect
            due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the yellowish or brownish hues.
            Aged contamination typically has a matte finish, reducing reflectivity. The buildup can appear darker in shadowed
            areas.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as oxidation and polymerization occur. With prolonged exposure and heat cycling, the surface can develop a crusty,
            almost varnish-like texture. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly granular or amorphous structure, especially
            in areas with high concentrations of calcium sulfonates.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.1-2 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Heavily carbonized areas can reach up to 5 mm in thickness.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            pools/puddles (in low points), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas with high heat exposure),
            discrete patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (from airborne particles), stains (discoloration of
            the crystal surface), and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the contamination was applied intentionally and evenly. Variations are caused by uneven
            application, gravity, temperature gradients, and surface irregularities.
        limestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy film with a dark brown color. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (almost black), and more matte. The texture changes from oily to sticky
            and eventually to a hard, crusty residue. Oxidation and polymerization increase the viscosity and reduce the solubility
            of the contaminant.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., drip locations) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward. Uniform gradual
            accumulation is possible but less common than point-source expansion. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A3000 (Dark Chocolate), Aged contamination: #211800 (Jet Black), Intermediate:
            #362400 (Dark Roast Coffee), Oxidized surface: #543D1E (Seal Brown), Light stain: #735429 (Umber)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in depressions, and accumulation
            along edges and corners. Point source contamination results in radial spreading patterns. Crevices and porous
            areas tend to accumulate more contamination than smooth, exposed surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and porous areas exhibit higher
            concentrations than smooth, exposed surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more contamination than exposed areas
            due to reduced weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            discoloration, thin film, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant darkening, visible buildup, thickness
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Dark, thick coating, crusty texture, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete
            coverage, very thick, hardened layer, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on limestone presents as a darkening and discoloration of the stone surface,
            ranging from light staining to thick, viscous coatings. The color is typically dark brown to black, with a greasy
            or matte texture. Distribution varies from localized spots to extensive coverage, often concentrated in crevices
            and low-lying areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to capillary action and surface
            tension), point source spreading (from leaks or spills), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or porous areas). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and surface
            tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker outline. This effect is more pronounced
            on porous limestone.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices and pores due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours
            due to surface tension and gravity. It bridges gaps due to surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common on walls.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces as
            droplets before detaching.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Aged contamination tends
            to be matte and absorbs light. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Iridescence
            is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slick to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky as
            the oil oxidizes and polymerizes. With heavy buildup, a crusty or hardened layer can form. At a microscopic level
            (SEM), the surface shows a porous structure filled with the contaminant, often with particulate matter embedded
            within.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (micrometers) to heavy buildup exceeding 1 mm (millimeter).
            Typical buildup in industrial settings ranges from 50 μm to 500 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the stone), uniform coatings (rare,
            usually from intentional application), buildups (accumulations in specific areas). Drip marks and thin films are
            most common initially, progressing to thick crusts over time.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface porosity, surface geometry, and the
            method of contamination (e.g., drips vs. spray).
        magnesium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often barely visible. Over time (days to weeks),
            it darkens and thickens due to oxidation and polymerization. Months-old contamination becomes a hardened, matte
            crust, often mixed with dust and debris. The color shifts from amber to dark brown or black, and the texture becomes
            increasingly rough and less pliable.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) that spreads from the initial contact point.
            Over days, it thickens due to continued deposition and oxidation. It may begin at edges and then move inward,
            or start at point sources and expand outward. Layering effects can occur with intermittent contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup. Months of accumulation
            result in a hardened, crusty layer.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (khaki), translucent amber. Days old: #A07A55 (sienna), light brown.
            Weeks old: #604A3F (dark brown), matte. Months old: #362F2E (charcoal), almost black. Heavily oxidized: #222222
            (jet black), potentially with a slight greenish tint due to magnesium corrosion products underneath.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices, and a general accumulation
            on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are also frequently observed.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity
            and capillary action. Edges and corners also accumulate more buildup due to surface tension. Top surfaces may
            have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to dripping. Exposed areas may have less buildup than sheltered areas
            due to washing by rain or other fluids.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often only detectable by touch. Thickness:
            1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): Patchy distribution, slight discoloration. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating, darker color. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, obscuring the original surface.
            Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, tar-like buildup, completely obscuring the original surface.
            Thickness: >500 μm, potentially several millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on magnesium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating, ranging from
            a thin, almost invisible film to a thick, tar-like layer. The color is initially a light amber, darkening to a
            deep brown or black with age and oxidation. Coverage patterns vary greatly depending on the source and environment,
            but often concentrate in low-lying areas and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually from immersion), edge
            accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (from splattering), streaky/linear (from dripping),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to creep along the edges, forming a thicker layer compared to the center areas. While the center
            may have a thin film, the edges often exhibit a noticeable buildup. This effect is more pronounced with viscous
            oils and greases.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows contours, creating patterns that mirror
            the surface shape. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking
            is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker buildup. Runs occur down slopes. Oil can
            hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the darker, aged buildup. Heavily oxidized areas may appear matte and absorb light. Iridescence
            can occur in very thin films due to interference effects, but is not common with thick buildup.
          texture_details: Fresh oil is smooth and slippery to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With significant buildup, it can form a crusty, hardened surface. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or slightly crystalline structure, especially with ZDDP breakdown products. The surface can range from glossy
            when wet to matte when dry.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.5-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more,
            resembling a tar-like coating.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from dripping),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (from splattering), spots/dots (from fine misting), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (localized accumulations), and potentially crystalline structures (from additive breakdown).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, environmental conditions, and
            the geometry of the magnesium surface. Splattering and dripping lead to non-uniform distributions, while immersion
            may result in a more even coating.
        mahogany:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Aged contamination becomes thicker, darker,
            and more matte. The oil oxidizes, leading to a varnish-like or tar-like consistency. Cracking and crazing may
            occur in thick deposits. The surface becomes increasingly difficult to clean.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings).
            It then spreads outward, following the wood grain and accumulating in crevices. Edges tend to accumulate oil first.
            Over time, the film thickens, oxidizes, and attracts dust and debris. Layering effects may occur with repeated
            contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
            The process can take hours for a thin film to form, days for noticeable discoloration, and months for a thick,
            crusty deposit to develop.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, similar to honey (#F0C808) with a slight green tint due to additives.'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Darker amber, approaching burnt sienna (#E9724C).'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown with reddish undertones, like reddish-brown (#A0522D).'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to almost black, with a matte finish (#301919).'
          - 'Oxidized/Contaminated: Mottled appearance with areas of dark brown (#4A3026) mixed with lighter, grayish-brown
            (#848482) due to dust and debris accumulation.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along
            edges due to gravity and surface tension. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Splatter patterns may be
            present near machinery. Areas around lubrication points are heavily contaminated. Horizontal surfaces exhibit
            pooling.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier at edges and in crevices. Top surfaces of horizontal
            areas tend to have more dust accumulation, leading to a darker, grayer appearance. Bottom edges of vertical surfaces
            exhibit drip marks and pooling. Corners and joints accumulate the most oil due to surface tension and gravity.

              description: 'Very thick, hardened crust with extensive cracking and debris. Thickness: >500 μm.'

            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%

              description: 'Visible coating with distinct drip marks and pooling. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual: Darker color, sticky texture, some dust accumulation.

              coverage: <10%

              visual: Barely perceptible sheen or discoloration.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on mahogany presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to a thick, viscous coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown, with
            a generally sticky or tacky texture. Coverage varies from localized spots to extensive surface coatings, often
            concentrated in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Point source spreading
            (from lubrication points), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), Patchy/spotty (due to
            uneven application or splashing), Streaky/linear (from drips or runs), Localized concentrations (in crevices and
            joints). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices. This is due to
            surface tension effects, which cause the oil to be drawn towards the edges. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, or be relatively clean if the contamination originates from the edges. The perimeter is
            often heavily coated.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to
            gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating runs. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows
            contours of the wood grain. It may bridge small gaps or fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil may hang from overhead surfaces in the form of droplets
            or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and accumulates dust, the
            sheen diminishes, becoming more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations and surface irregularities
            more clearly. Heavily oxidized oil may appear almost black and absorb most of the light.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky as the oil oxidizes
            and polymerizes. Dust and debris adhere to the surface, creating a rough, gritty texture. In heavy buildup, a
            crusty or hardened layer may form. At a microscopic level, the oil penetrates the wood grain, making it difficult
            to remove completely. The surface feels slightly waxy.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Thin films can be as little as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 25-100 μm. Heavy deposits can reach 0.5-2 mm or more, resembling a thick coating.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (sloping surfaces),
            Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged, oxidized oil), Discrete
            patches (splashes or spills), Spots/dots (small droplets), Stains (penetration into the wood), Uniform coatings
            (rare, usually intentional application), Buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. It is rarely
            perfectly uniform. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, gravity, application method,
            and the presence of dust and debris. Areas near lubrication points are significantly more contaminated than remote
            areas.
        manganese:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, oily film with a dark gray color and iridescent
            sheen. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes a thick, hardened crust with a near-black color. The surface
            loses its sheen and becomes dull. The thickness increases significantly, and the deposit becomes more difficult
            to remove. Cracking and flaking may occur in extreme cases.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours) that uniformly coats the surface or begins at contact
            points (days) and spreads. It then thickens (days to weeks), especially at edges and in crevices. Over time (weeks
            to months), oxidation and polymerization cause the oil/grease to harden and darken. Layering effects may occur
            if fresh oil/grease is added on top of existing buildup. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect
            the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #362F2E (Dark Charcoal Gray) with iridescent sheen. Initial oxidation (days):
            #4A3C39 (Dark Brown). Moderate oxidation (weeks): #604E46 (Medium Brown). Heavy oxidation (months): #211E1E (Near
            Black). Extreme oxidation (years): #121111 (Black) with possible reddish-brown (#800000) rust staining underneath
            if the manganese is corroding.'
          common_patterns: The buildup tends to accumulate in areas where oil/grease is likely to be deposited or where it
            can pool due to gravity. This includes edges, corners, crevices, and horizontal surfaces. Initially, it may appear
            as localized spots or streaks, gradually spreading to form a more continuous coating. Drip marks are common on
            vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Crevices and low-lying areas also accumulate more contamination due to gravity and capillary action. Vertical
            walls exhibit drip marks with higher concentration at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces tend to have a more uniform
            coating, but with thicker deposits in the center if the oil/grease is applied from above.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, very thin film (1-5 μm), barely visible. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, slight discoloration (5-15 μm). Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coating, noticeable
            darkening (15-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, significant buildup in crevices (50-200 μm). Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, hardened crust, completely obscures the manganese surface (>200 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on manganese surfaces typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that
            ranges in color from dark brown to black, often with a slightly iridescent sheen when fresh. The texture is generally
            sticky and uneven, accumulating preferentially in crevices and low-lying areas. Over time, it hardens and darkens
            due to oxidation and polymerization.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary action),
            Point source spreading (from lubrication points), Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), Patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), Streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), Localized concentrations (in crevices
            or low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to spread outwards from the center, but the edges act as a barrier,
            trapping the oil/grease and causing it to build up. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges
            or corners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to surface tension and capillary action. It builds up in
            crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, forming a thicker layer. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating drip marks. It collects at edges, forming a bead-like buildup. It follows contours, conforming to the
            shape of the surface. It bridges gaps, forming a continuous layer across small openings. It fills depressions,
            leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and runs on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking
            is common due to oil/grease flowing downwards. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform
            coating. Runs occur down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces,
            forming droplets that eventually drip off.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable iridescent sheen, reflecting
            different colors depending on the viewing angle. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the dark brown to black color
            more clearly. Aged contamination has a matte finish and reflects very little light. The presence of metal particles
            can create small, localized specular reflections.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch, becoming increasingly sticky and viscous
            as it ages. With prolonged exposure to heat and oxygen, it transforms into a hard, crusty layer. Microscopic examination
            reveals a non-uniform surface with embedded particulate matter (metal wear debris, dirt). The surface can feel
            slightly rough due to the hardened deposits and embedded particles. Grain is generally absent unless there are
            pre-existing surface features on the manganese.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm. Extreme buildup: >2
            mm. These values vary significantly depending on the application and exposure conditions.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (from oil/grease
            flowing down surfaces), Pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), Thin films (initial layer of contamination), Thick
            crusts (aged contamination), Discrete patches (localized areas of buildup), Spots/dots (small droplets of oil/grease),
            Stains (discoloration of the manganese surface), Uniform coatings (on horizontal surfaces with even application),
            Buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil/grease application. Areas with higher surface roughness or lower temperatures
            tend to accumulate more contamination.
        maple:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light in color. Aged contamination darkens
            significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface may develop a matte finish due to oxidation and
            the accumulation of particulate matter. Cracking and crazing can occur in heavily contaminated areas.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, almost imperceptible film at contact points
            or leak sources (hours). 2) Spreads outward from the source, following surface contours and accumulating in low-lying
            areas (days). 3) Thickens over time due to continued leakage and evaporation of volatile components (weeks). 4)
            Oxidation and polymerization lead to hardening and darkening of the deposit (months). 5) Layering effects can
            occur with repeated contamination events, creating distinct strata within the buildup (years).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, close to #F0E68C (Khaki)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-brown, #A07A44 (Sienna)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown, #8B4513 (SaddleBrown)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black, #362F2F (DarkLiver)'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Affected: Reddish-brown, #B7410E (Rust)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and in corners. Splatter patterns from machinery are also frequently observed. A gradient of contamination
            is often present, with the highest concentration near the source of the leak or spill.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier near the source of the contamination and in areas where
            oil/grease can accumulate due to gravity or capillary action. Edges, corners, and crevices often exhibit higher
            concentrations than flat, exposed surfaces. Vertical surfaces show a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier
            concentrations at the bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Nearly complete coverage with a very thick, often hardened layer. Surface is heavily discolored
                and may exhibit cracking or crazing.
              thickness: '>1 mm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Extensive coverage with a thick, dark layer. Surface may be hard or crusty in places.
              thickness: 250 μm - 1 mm

              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Noticeable discoloration with some visible pooling or streaking. Surface feels slightly oily.
              thickness: 10-50 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Significant discoloration with a thicker, more visible layer. Surface feels sticky or tacky.

              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Minimal discoloration.
              thickness: <10 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on maple presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick,
            sticky or hardened layer, depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often
            non-uniform, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            2) Edge accumulation (capillary action), 3) Drip marks (vertical surfaces), 4) Pooling (horizontal surfaces),
            5) Streaky/linear (from wiping or cleaning attempts), 6) Patchy/spotty (uneven application or splatter).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to capillary
            action and surface tension. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated
            band. Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, or be relatively clean depending on the source and
            pattern of contamination.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            drip marks. Edges act as collection points. Depressions fill with oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and pooling at bottom edges. Horizontal surfaces exhibit settling
            and pooling. Slopes show runs down the incline. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets or stalactite-like
            formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the discoloration and texture variations. Aged contamination often has a matte finish,
            reducing reflectivity. Iridescence can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slick to the touch. Over time, oxidation and polymerization
            can lead to a sticky, tacky feel. With further aging and exposure to heat, the surface can become hard, crusty,
            and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal a fine, granular structure, especially in areas
            with high ZDDP concentration.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a monomolecular layer (<1 μm) in initial stages to several millimeters (1-5
            mm) in areas of heavy buildup. Typical thin films range from 25-100 μm, while heavy deposits can exceed 1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films (initial contamination), 2) Drip marks (vertical
            surfaces), 3) Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), 4) Thick crusts (aged, oxidized deposits), 5) Discrete patches
            (splatter or uneven application), 6) Stains (penetration into the wood grain), 7) Buildups (accumulation in corners
            and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. This is due to the
            nature of oil/grease leaks and spills, which rarely result in perfectly uniform coverage. The presence of surface
            imperfections and variations in porosity also contribute to non-uniformity.
        marble:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often transparent or translucent. Over time,
            it darkens due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. The texture becomes more viscous and sticky.
            Aged deposits can harden into a crusty layer, sometimes exhibiting cracking or flaking. Thickness increases significantly
            with age.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours). It then thickens and darkens over days due to oxidation
            and the accumulation of dirt. Buildup often begins at contact points (e.g., around bearings) and spreads outward.
            Edges tend to accumulate oil first, then the contamination moves inward. Layering effects can occur with repeated
            applications of oil. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and the
            viscosity of the oil. The progression is highly dependent on the specific environment and maintenance practices.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to yellowish-brown (#C4A484). Moderately aged: Medium
            brown (#A0785A) with reddish undertones. Heavily aged: Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#000000) in areas
            of thick accumulation. Oxidation products can introduce rust-orange (#B7410E) hues, especially with ZDDP breakdown.
            Water contamination can create a milky, opaque appearance in lighter areas.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low-lying areas,
            and a general darkening of the marble surface. Accumulation is often concentrated around machinery or lubrication
            points. Splatter patterns from rotating equipment are also frequently observed. Edges and corners tend to accumulate
            more debris.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces of horizontal areas may have a thinner film due to settling
            of particulate matter. Crevices and low-lying areas accumulate more oil due to gravity. Vertical walls exhibit
            a gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to drip marks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible film, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, visible film,
            thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Darkened surface, thick film or crust, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%):
            Almost complete coverage, thick crust, thickness >100 μm, potentially reaching several millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on marble typically presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte coating,
            ranging from light staining to thick, viscous accumulations. The color varies from light amber to dark brown or
            black, depending on the oil type, age, and environmental conditions. Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced
            by surface geometry and fluid dynamics.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually after cleaning attempts),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splatter), streaky/linear
            (drip marks), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (from rotating equipment).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to
            surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends to spread from these points, but the highest concentrations
            remain at the edges. Uniform distribution is rare unless the surface has been recently cleaned or treated.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action and surface tension. Flat areas tend to pool oil. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges
            collect oil due to surface tension. Contours influence the flow and distribution of the oil. Depressions fill
            with oil.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Oil pools at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            down slopes. Oil does not hang from overhead surfaces unless the viscosity is extremely high and the surface is
            rough.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged deposits tend to
            have a matte finish due to surface roughness and the presence of particulate matter. Thicker deposits may exhibit
            a slight iridescence or rainbow effect due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight
            the discoloration and contrast between clean and contaminated areas.
          texture_details: Texture ranges from smooth and oily to sticky and tacky, depending on the oil's viscosity and age.
            Aged deposits can become crusty or hardened due to oxidation and polymerization. Microscopic examination may reveal
            a granular or amorphous structure. The surface can feel slightly rough due to embedded particulate matter (e.g.,
            metal shavings, dirt).
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. Drip marks can have a thickness gradient, ranging from <10 μm at the top to >100 μm
            at the bottom. Crusty deposits can reach thicknesses of 2-10 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (splatter), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into the marble), uniform coatings (after
            cleaning), buildups (around joints), and no crystalline structures are expected.'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, the surface geometry, and the
            cleaning history. Areas near lubrication points or machinery tend to have higher concentrations. Gravity also
            plays a role, leading to uneven distribution on vertical surfaces.
        mdf:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous. Oxidation products may
            form a reddish-brown crust at the surface. The surface becomes less glossy and more matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common
            than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#964B00). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#3B2F2F) to almost black (#000000) with reddish-brown (#A52A2A) oxidation products at the edges. Heavily
            contaminated areas may exhibit a greenish-black sheen due to sulfurized additives.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and a general
            darkening of the MDF surface. Accumulation is often more pronounced around edges and corners due to capillary
            action and surface tension. Point source contamination leads to radial spreading.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action. Bottom
            surfaces of horizontal MDF pieces often have higher concentrations due to gravity. Crevices and depressions act
            as collection points. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to downward
            flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, slight darkening of the MDF, thickness <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable darkening, slight sheen, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct brown coloration, tacky to
            the touch, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark brown coating, crusty texture, thickness 100-500 μm.
            Extreme (>85%): Very thick, almost black coating, gummy or crusty, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on MDF presents as a darkening, often glossy, stain that can range from
            a light sheen to a thick, tacky coating. The color is typically brown or amber, darkening with age and oxidation.
            Coverage patterns vary widely depending on the source and exposure, but often concentrate along edges and in crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with deliberate application),
            edge accumulation (very common), point source spreading (common near machinery), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent exposure), streaky/linear (due to drips or runs),
            localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around spray points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. The porous nature of MDF allows the oil to wick into the edges. The center areas tend to
            have lower concentrations unless there is a direct source of contamination in that area.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas. Drips form on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to capillary
            action. It follows contours and fills depressions. It may bridge small gaps.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            down slopes are observed. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces in the initial stages before dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Aged contamination tends to be matte, with little to no sheen.
            Iridescence may be observed in areas with very thick buildup due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels oily and slick. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. Heavy buildup
            can form a crusty or gummy texture. At a microscopic level, the surface may appear uneven and slightly porous
            due to the MDF absorbing the oil. There is no crystalline structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. The average thickness in moderately contaminated areas is typically between 25-100 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, heavy buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (absorbed into the MDF), uniform coatings (rare), and
            buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The MDF's inherent porosity and uneven surface contribute to non-uniformity. The method
            of contamination (e.g., spray vs. drip) also significantly impacts uniformity.
        metal matrix composites mmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more viscous or even solid. Oxidation
            and polymerization lead to a crusty or hardened surface. Particulate matter and debris become embedded in the
            aged grease, further altering the texture and color.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks) due to
            continued deposition and oxidation. It often begins at contact points (e.g., bearings, seals) and spreads outward.
            Accumulation may start at edges and move inward, or vice versa depending on the source. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or
            intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#F0C808) or light tan (#D2B48C). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#A0785A), then a dark reddish-brown (#8B4513), and eventually
            a near-black (#221F1F) in heavily oxidized areas. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown hue in some
            cases.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and in crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. A thin, uniform
            film may initially cover the entire surface, followed by localized buildup in areas of high friction or heat.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly across the surface. Edges and corners tend to have
            heavier buildup due to surface tension and capillary action. Crevices and low-lying areas accumulate more due
            to gravity. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces collect pooled oil/grease. Exposed areas
            may experience more oxidation and hardening compared to sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film; thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Patchy, translucent
            coating; thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, oily or tacky to the touch; thickness
            5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating, dark color; thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty
            buildup, potentially solid; thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) typically presents as a mottled, uneven
            coating ranging from light tan to dark brown. The texture varies from a thin, oily film to a thick, tacky or even
            crusty layer, depending on the age and severity of the contamination. Coverage patterns are often influenced by
            gravity and surface geometry, leading to accumulations in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with aerosolized application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension and capillary action), point source spreading (around leaks or
            lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent
            application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from wiping or dripping), localized concentrations (in
            crevices or around fasteners), and radial patterns (around grease fittings).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker and thicker band compared to the center areas.
            This effect is more pronounced on rough or porous surfaces. Uniform distribution is rare unless the contamination
            is applied as a fine mist or aerosol.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, follows contours, bridges gaps, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to have higher concentrations due
            to surface tension effects.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations
            in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Thick buildup can create shadows and highlights, emphasizing the uneven texture.
            Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects, especially with certain additives.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to tacky and sticky as it ages. With prolonged
            exposure to heat and oxygen, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly crystalline in areas with high concentrations
            of ZDDP or calcium sulfonates. It feels rough to the touch, especially in areas with particulate matter accumulation.
            Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in areas of severe leakage or neglect.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged and oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosolized deposition), stains (penetration
            into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (accumulations in specific areas), and potentially crystalline
            structures (with certain additives under specific conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, the surface finish of the MMC,
            and the operating conditions. Areas with high friction or heat tend to accumulate more contamination.
        molybdenum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, easily wiped away. Over time, it darkens, thickens,
            and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination is characterized by a matte finish, hardened texture, and potential
            cracking or flaking. The color shifts from dark brown to almost black as oxidation progresses. Thickness increases
            significantly over time, potentially reaching several millimeters in heavy buildup areas.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or lubrication
            ports. It then spreads outward, thickening over time. The edges tend to accumulate more rapidly than the center.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure to oil mist. Point sources expand outward, creating
            radial patterns. Layering effects can occur with intermittent lubrication or cleaning. Seasonal variations in
            temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening. Timeframes: Hours (thin film formation),
            Days (noticeable thickening), Months (significant buildup and hardening).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #362F2E (Dark Charcoal Gray) with a slight sheen. Days old: #4A3C39 (Dark
            Taupe) with a hint of brown. Weeks old: #604E45 (Olive Brown). Months old: #463E37 (Dark Brown) with matte finish.
            Heavily oxidized/aged: #211E1E (Almost Black) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from underlying corrosion
            if moisture is present.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running oil, uniform coating
            on surfaces exposed to oil mist, accumulation in crevices and corners, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Initial
            buildup often occurs around seals, bearings, and other points of high friction or lubricant application.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low-lying areas also tend to accumulate more contamination. Flat surfaces may have a more
            uniform coating, while vertical walls exhibit drip marks. Exposed areas may experience more oxidation and hardening,
            while sheltered areas may retain a more oily consistency.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often appearing as a slight discoloration.
            Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable film with some visible texture. Thickness: 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Distinct coating with visible buildup in some areas. Thickness: 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating
            with significant buildup and potential crusting. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, tar-like layer
            with extensive crusting and potential cracking. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on molybdenum typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, tar-like layer. The color is usually dark brown or black, with
            a semi-glossy to matte finish depending on the age and oxidation level. Coverage can be uniform or highly localized,
            often accumulating in crevices and low-lying areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (from dripping or running), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (from oil mist). The specific
            pattern depends heavily on the application method and operating environment.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the
            center. This effect is more pronounced on smooth surfaces. On rough surfaces, the distribution may be more uniform
            due to increased surface area and adhesion.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners due to surface
            tension. Crevices act as traps for contamination. Flat areas allow for pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping.
            Edges define the boundaries of the contamination. Contours influence the flow of oil. Depressions fill with oil.
            These effects are driven by surface tension, gravity, and capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil can hang from overhead surfaces, eventually dripping down.
            The rate of flow depends on the viscosity of the oil and the surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the dark color and texture more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, reducing
            reflectivity. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with very thin films of fresh oil.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Days old: Sticky and slightly tacky. Weeks old:
            Viscous, gummy, and may attract dust and debris. Months old: Hardened, crusty, and less tacky. Heavily oxidized/aged:
            Brittle, cracked, and potentially powdery in some areas. Grain is generally not visible without magnification,
            but larger particulates (e.g., metal shavings) may be embedded.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Light buildup: 10-50 μm. Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm. Extreme buildup: >1 mm. These values vary significantly based on operating conditions and maintenance
            practices.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (on exposed surfaces), thick crusts (from oxidation and hardening),
            discrete patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (from oil mist), stains (from absorbed oil), uniform
            coatings (from consistent exposure), and buildups (in areas of high accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare, usually only seen with oil mist applications.
            Mostly uniform with minor variations is common on surfaces directly exposed to lubricant. Moderately patchy is
            typical in areas with uneven wear or contamination. Highly variable/irregular occurs in areas with complex geometry
            or inconsistent lubrication. Concentration is often higher near lubrication points and lower in remote areas.
        mortar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a wet, glossy film with a dark brown color. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes a matte, black, and often crusty layer. The thickness increases over time, and the surface
            may exhibit cracking or flaking due to weathering and oxidation. The aged material is less soluble and more difficult
            to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days and weeks. It often begins at
            contact points (e.g., leaks) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward, or it can be
            a more uniform gradual accumulation. Layering effects can occur with intermittent contamination events. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and weathering.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A3000 (Dark Chocolate), Aged contamination: #000000 (Black), Intermediate:
            #362400 (Dark Brown), Oxidized/Weathered: #262626 (Dark Gray), Lightly contaminated: #736357 (Taupe with slight
            sheen)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low-lying areas,
            and a general darkening of the mortar surface. Accumulation is often more pronounced along edges and joints where
            oil can wick into the porous material. Splatter patterns are also frequently observed near machinery.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity, in
            crevices and corners where oil accumulates, and on horizontal surfaces where it settles. Exposed areas may experience
            some weathering and removal, leading to lower concentrations compared to sheltered areas. The gradient is typically
            highest near the source of the contamination.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible, thickness <10 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            discoloration, thin film, thickness 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Darker staining, visible film, thickness 50-200
            μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant darkening, thick coating, thickness 200-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete
            coverage, very thick crust, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on mortar presents as a darkening and staining of the surface, ranging
            from subtle discoloration to a thick, viscous coating. The color is typically dark brown to black, with a greasy
            or oily sheen initially. Coverage varies from localized spots and streaks to extensive, almost complete coverage,
            depending on the source and duration of exposure.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading (radial pattern from a
            leak), 2) Streaky/linear (drip marks), 3) Localized concentrations (around joints and edges), 4) Patchy/spotty
            (splatter), 5) Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), 6) Uniform coating (rare, but possible
            in enclosed environments with aerosolized oil).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and joints due to capillary
            action and the increased surface area available for adhesion. The porous nature of mortar at the edges also facilitates
            absorption. While the center may also be contaminated, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action and gravity. It pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, and collects at edges due
            to surface tension. It may bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil hangs from
            overhead surfaces until it reaches a critical mass and drips.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting may reveal subtle color variations and highlight the uneven distribution. Aged contamination tends to
            have a matte finish, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin
            films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slick to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky as
            volatile components evaporate. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty, sometimes brittle
            layer. Microscopic examination may reveal a heterogeneous mixture of amorphous and semi-crystalline structures.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-5 mm or more
            in extreme cases. The average thickness in moderately contaminated areas is typically between 50-200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks), 2) Runs/streaks (angled flow
            patterns), 3) Pools/puddles (in depressions), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged buildup),
            6) Discrete patches (splatter), 7) Stains (penetration into the mortar pores).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in the source of contamination, the porosity
            of the mortar, and the influence of gravity and airflow.
        neodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, glossy, amber-colored film. Aged contamination
            (months/years old) darkens to a dark brown or black, becomes thicker and more viscous, and may harden into a crusty
            or tar-like substance. The surface loses its gloss and becomes matte. Cracking and flaking may occur in extreme
            cases.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: (1) Starts as a thin, transparent film within hours of application.
            (2) Begins at contact points and edges, spreading outward over days. (3) Thickens gradually over weeks, becoming
            more viscous and darker. (4) Accumulation accelerates in areas with higher temperatures or exposure to contaminants.
            (5) Over months, the oil/grease oxidizes and hardens, forming a crusty layer. (6) Layering effects may occur with
            repeated applications or exposure events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can influence the rate
            of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F0C808) with a slight iridescence'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#A07A3D)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#6B4F4F)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3B331C) with black (#000000) edges due to oxidation'
          - 'Extreme Buildup: Black (#000000) with a hint of dark reddish-brown (#800000) underneath'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or flow,
            and accumulation in low-lying areas due to gravity. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface
            tension effects. Flat surfaces often exhibit a more uniform, albeit thin, coating. Crevices and threads of fasteners
            act as traps for the oil/grease.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also
            tend to have higher concentrations. Flat surfaces generally have a thinner, more uniform coating. Vertical walls
            exhibit drip marks and streaks.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete coating, thick and crusty buildup. Thickness: >100 μm, potentially reaching millimeters.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Nearly complete coating, significant buildup. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'

              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with some bare areas. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Partial coating, visible buildup in some areas. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on neodymium surfaces typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that
            ranges in color from amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a smooth, oily film to a hardened, sticky residue
            depending on age and environmental conditions. Coverage patterns are often non-uniform, with accumulation in crevices
            and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (thin film), edge accumulation (due
            to surface tension), point source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness
            with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (from flow or wiping), localized concentrations
            (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating parts). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most
            common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to creep along the edges, forming a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This is especially
            noticeable on flat surfaces and around the perimeter of components. The center areas may have a thinner, more
            uniform coating, or even be relatively clean in some cases.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices and threads of fasteners due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas
            due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours
            of the surface. It can bridge small gaps. It fills depressions and indentations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking
            is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. It runs down slopes. It can hang from overhead surfaces,
            forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Aged buildup tends to have a matte finish and absorbs light. Iridescence
            may be visible in thin films due to interference effects. The color appears darker in shaded areas.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged
            exposure and oxidation, it can become a hard, crusty residue. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or
            amorphous structure. It feels slippery when fresh, becoming increasingly rough and abrasive as it hardens. The
            surface can be slightly reflective when fresh, transitioning to a matte finish as it oxidizes.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (micrometers) when freshly applied to a heavy buildup
            of 0.1-2 mm (millimeters) after prolonged exposure. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 5 mm or more in localized
            areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (uneven application),
            spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (at edges
            and corners), and potentially crystalline structures (from additive precipitation under specific conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of application. Gravity also plays a role in redistributing the oil/grease.
        nickel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film with a light brown or amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (dark brown to black), and more viscous or even solid.
            It can develop a crusty or hardened surface, and may exhibit signs of oxidation, such as a duller finish and increased
            brittleness. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: Starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks).
            Begins at contact points (lubrication points, wear areas) then spreads outward. Often starts at edges then moves
            inward due to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation can occur with consistent lubrication. Point sources
            expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then to a dark brown (#654321), and eventually to
            a near-black (#000000) with possible hints of rust-orange (#B7410E) if iron particles are present from wear.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coatings on flat surfaces, localized spots around lubrication points,
            streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces, and accumulations in crevices and corners. Edges and areas with restricted
            airflow tend to accumulate more buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to a thicker, darker layer. Crevices and sheltered
            areas trap more oil/grease. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with heavier buildup at the bottom.
            Horizontal surfaces accumulate a more uniform layer. Exposed areas may experience more wear and less buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Thickness:
            <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film with visible spots and streaks. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A more continuous film with some areas of thicker buildup. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, continuous
            layer with significant buildup in corners and crevices. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty
            layer covering almost the entire surface. Thickness: >100 μm, often exceeding 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on nickel presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically brown or black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to localized
            accumulations, often influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually only with intentional
            application), edge accumulation (common due to surface tension and capillary action), point source spreading (around
            lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices
            or corners), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to creep along the surface, concentrating at the perimeter. This is especially
            noticeable on flat surfaces and in corners. The center may have a thinner, more uniform film, while the edges
            exhibit a thicker, more pronounced buildup.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, providing a sheltered environment. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows contours,
            creating a non-uniform thickness. It can bridge gaps, creating a continuous layer. It fills depressions, leveling
            the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks
            on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common
            pattern. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating a thicker layer. Runs occur down slopes. Oil/grease
            can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            tends to highlight the darker colors and textures of aged buildup. A thin film may show slight iridescence, especially
            with certain additives. The surface can appear matte when heavily oxidized.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry. Over
            time, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly crystalline due to oxidation and polymerization of the hydrocarbons.
            The surface can exhibit a slight sheen when wet, transitioning to a matte finish as it dries. It feels slippery
            when fresh, becoming increasingly abrasive as it hardens.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more,
            resembling a thick crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or localized leaks), stains (penetration into porous surfaces),
            uniform coatings (intentional application), buildups (accumulation over time), and potentially crystalline structures
            (with specific additives under certain conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible on flat, regularly lubricated surfaces. Moderately patchy is common in areas with uneven wear or lubrication.
            Highly variable/irregular is typical in complex geometries or areas with inconsistent maintenance. Concentration
            is often higher near lubrication points and lower in areas with high airflow.
        niobium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, almost invisible film with an iridescent sheen. As it ages,
            the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darkening in color (from light brown to dark brown or black) and
            a thickening of the layer. The texture changes from smooth and oily to rough and crusty. Aged contamination is
            often more difficult to remove and may exhibit signs of corrosion underneath.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or near lubrication sources.
            It then spreads outwards, thickening over time. Edges and corners tend to accumulate oil first, followed by the
            center areas. The process can be accelerated by high temperatures or humidity. Layering effects may occur if different
            types of oil are used or if cleaning is intermittent. Timeframes vary, but noticeable buildup can occur within
            hours or days, while significant crusting may take months or years.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh contamination: Iridescent sheen with subtle yellow (#FFFF00) or light brown (#A67B5B) hues, almost transparent.'
          - 'Slightly aged (days): Light to medium brown (#A67B5B to #8B4513), becoming more opaque.'
          - 'Moderately aged (weeks): Dark brown (#8B4513) with hints of reddish-brown (#B7410E) due to oxidation.'
          - 'Heavily aged (months): Black (#000000) or very dark brown (#331A00) with a matte finish.'
          - 'Extreme buildup (years): Black (#000000) with a hardened, crusty texture and potential for green (#008000) or
            blue (#0000FF) tinges from corrosion products underneath the buildup.'
          common_patterns: 'The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include: localized spots near lubrication
            points, streaks from dripping or running oil, accumulation in crevices and corners, and a general tendency for
            thicker buildup on horizontal surfaces due to gravity. Edges and areas with restricted airflow often exhibit heavier
            contamination.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more oil than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered
            areas trap oil and debris, leading to higher concentrations. Exposed areas may experience some removal of oil
            due to airflow or cleaning, resulting in lower concentrations.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'A very thick, hardened crust with significant discoloration and potential corrosion underneath.
                Thickness: >1 mm.'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'A thick, dark brown or black coating with a crusty texture. Thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm.'
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'A thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'A more continuous film with noticeable darkening and a slightly tacky texture. Thickness: 10-100
                μm.'
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated droplets or thin streaks of oil, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on niobium typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the
            oil type, age, and environmental conditions, but generally exhibits a sticky or tacky texture. Coverage patterns
            are often influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: point source spreading (oil leaking from a fitting),
            gradient from source (thicker near the source, thinner further away), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to
            inconsistent application or cleaning), streaky/linear (oil running down a surface), localized concentrations (accumulation
            in crevices or corners), and radial patterns (spreading from a central point).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil tends to spread outwards from these points, but the center areas may remain
            relatively clean if the oil source is located near the edges. Uniform distribution is rare.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas
            tend to pool oil, while vertical surfaces experience dripping. Oil collects at edges due to surface tension. Contours
            and depressions can trap oil, leading to localized buildups. Gaps and small openings can be bridged by oil films.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes oil to flow downwards, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common phenomenon. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker
            layers. Runs down slopes are observed. Oil can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like
            formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit a strong iridescent sheen. As the oil ages and
            thickens, the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight
            the darker colors and textures of aged contamination. The presence of metallic particles or corrosion products
            can create a slight metallic sheen or sparkle under certain lighting conditions.
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup is oily and smooth to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. Over
            time, oxidation and polymerization cause it to harden, forming a rough, crusty surface. Depending on the specific
            oil and additives, crystalline structures may be visible under magnification (e.g., zinc dialkyldithiophosphate
            crystals). The texture can range from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, easily removable crust.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick'
            layer would be 1-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks from dripping oil), runs/streaks (oil
            flowing down a surface), pools/puddles (accumulation of oil on horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform or non-uniform
            coating), thick crusts (hardened, aged oil), discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), spots/dots (small
            droplets of oil), stains (discoloration of the surface), and buildups (accumulation of oil in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil application. Gravity also plays a significant role, causing oil to flow
            and accumulate in certain areas.
        nitinol:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens
            in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination often hardens and forms a crusty or gummy residue.
            Oxidation products may become visible, adding a reddish-brown or rust-colored tint.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It then thickens gradually over days,
            especially at contact points and edges. Spreading from these initial points occurs over weeks. Over months, layering
            effects become visible as new contamination deposits on top of older layers. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and the consistency of the residue.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Translucent amber (#F0C808) to light brown (#A0785A). Aged contamination:
            Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#222222) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges if oxidation of metal
            particles is present. Heavily oxidized grease can exhibit a greenish-black hue (#3F3F3F).'
          common_patterns: Initial accumulation often occurs at edges, crevices, and areas of high friction or stress. Over
            time, the contamination spreads to cover larger surface areas, forming streaks, drip marks, and localized pools.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate thicker layers due to gravity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to capillary action
            and reduced airflow. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more contamination than vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Sheltered areas may accumulate more debris than exposed areas. The top surface of horizontal components will often
            have a higher concentration than the underside.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin,
            translucent film with some visible streaks and spots, thickness around 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating
            with visible variations in thickness and color, thickness around 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating
            with significant buildup in certain areas, thickness around 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty coating
            with significant buildup and potential for dripping or flaking, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Nitinol typically appears as a viscous, non-uniform coating ranging
            from a light sheen to a thick, dark residue. The color varies from translucent amber to dark brown, depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. The texture ranges from smooth and oily to sticky and crusty, often
            with visible particulate matter.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), point source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (flow patterns), localized concentrations (in low spots
            or crevices). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners. The center may have a thin film, but the edges
            will exhibit a distinct buildup.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices, filling them completely.
            Pools on flat areas, creating thicker layers. Drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. Collects at edges,
            creating a raised rim. Follows contours, conforming to the surface shape. Bridges gaps, forming a continuous layer
            across discontinuities. Fills depressions, leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits.
            Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. Hangs from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures
            in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals a more matte finish. Thicker deposits may show slight iridescence due to thin-film interference. Aged,
            oxidized deposits tend to have a dull, matte appearance.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, and slippery to the touch. Aged: Sticky, tacky, and may contain hardened
            or crusty patches. Can feel gritty due to embedded particulate matter (metal wear debris, dirt). At high magnification,
            a slightly granular or amorphous structure is visible. The surface can exhibit a slight tackiness, even when seemingly
            dry.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters in localized areas.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity-induced
            flow), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (localized wear or leakage), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration
            into surface imperfections), uniform coatings (rare, usually from controlled application), buildups (at joints
            or seals).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, flow
            patterns, and the presence of localized sources of contamination.
        nylon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, translucent film with a light tan color.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more viscous. It often hardens
            into a crusty or waxy deposit, and may exhibit signs of oxidation, such as a reddish-brown discoloration. The
            surface becomes dull and matte.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or areas of high friction then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges then
            move inward. The progression can be a uniform gradual accumulation or from point sources that expand outward.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the viscosity and spread of the oil/grease.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light tan (#F5E7C6), almost translucent. Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C19A6B). Moderately
            Aged: Medium brown (#A67B5B) with reddish undertones. Heavily Aged: Dark brown (#5C4033) to almost black in extreme
            cases, sometimes with a hint of rust-orange (#B7410E) from oxidation.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal crevices, and a
            general accumulation along edges and corners. Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are also frequently observed.
            The buildup often starts at points of contact or areas of high friction.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces tend to accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas
            also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film with some visible discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with visible
            texture, thickness 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, crusty layer with significant discoloration, thickness 50-500
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, hardened deposit, almost completely obscuring the nylon surface, thickness >500
            μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on nylon typically presents as a discolored, often sticky or tacky coating.
            The color ranges from light tan to dark brown, depending on age and composition. Buildup tends to concentrate
            in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (most common), point source spreading
            (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (from
            splatters), streaky/linear (from drips or runs), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (rare,
            only with specific application methods).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to spread along the perimeter of the nylon component. This is especially pronounced in areas
            with sharp edges or corners. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, or remain relatively clean.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, collecting at edges and following contours.
            It can bridge gaps and fill depressions. Sharp edges tend to collect more oil/grease than rounded surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. It causes downward flow behavior, pooling at
            bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, and settling on horizontal surfaces. The angle
            of the surface directly influences the flow rate and accumulation pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the discoloration and texture variations. Aged deposits often appear matte and absorb
            light, making them appear darker. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or waxy consistency. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter
            embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte and dull when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. The thickness varies significantly depending on the location and duration of exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flowing oil),
            pools/puddles (in horizontal crevices), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (splatters), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated into the nylon), and buildups (accumulated
            deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, gravity, airflow, and the
            method of contamination. Areas near lubrication points or sources of leakage will have higher concentrations.
        oak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light stain with a slightly oily sheen. Over time, the oil darkens
            and thickens due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Aged contamination is often a dark brown
            or black, with a hardened, crusty texture. The wood beneath the contamination may become discolored and potentially
            degraded.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days and weeks. It often begins at
            contact points (e.g., leaks) then spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is less common than point source expansion. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D2B48C (tan) with a slight sheen. Days old: #A0785A (sienna brown). Weeks
            old: #8B4513 (saddle brown) with darker edges. Months old: #654321 (dark brown) to #000000 (black) in heavily
            contaminated areas. Aged (years): #362F2E (very dark brown) with possible green/black fungal growth.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and on horizontal
            surfaces, and a general darkening of the wood grain. Accumulation is often heaviest around joints, fasteners,
            and areas where oil may have leaked or spilled. Splatter patterns can also be present near machinery.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces of horizontal areas may have heavier buildup due to settling dust. Bottom edges
            of vertical surfaces will show drip marks and pooling. Sheltered areas may accumulate more oil due to reduced
            evaporation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            staining, slightly tacky, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Darker staining, sticky, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, dark, crusty, 0.1-1 mm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, black, hardened, >1 mm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on oak presents as a darkening and staining of the wood surface, typically
            ranging from a light amber to a dark brown or black. The texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film
            to a thick, tacky or even crusty layer, depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns
            are often uneven, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (common), point source spreading
            (around leaks), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (from splatters),
            streaky/linear (from drips), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (rare, but possible with
            intentional application).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil tends to spread outward from the edges, creating a darker perimeter around
            a lighter center area. Uniform distribution is rare unless intentionally applied.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices and follows the grain
            of the wood. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects
            at edges due to capillary action. It may bridge small gaps due to its viscosity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces, forming puddles or films. Runs
            down slopes are also observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming drips that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker areas of contamination. Aged contamination typically has a matte finish
            due to the accumulation of dirt and oxidation products. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films
            of certain oils.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and slightly oily to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and collects
            dust, it becomes tacky and then sticky. Over time, it can harden into a crusty or gummy residue. Close inspection
            may reveal a slightly uneven surface due to the wood grain and the uneven distribution of the oil. The surface
            can feel gritty due to embedded particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in thickness, especially in areas where oil
            has been allowed to accumulate for extended periods.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splatters), spots/dots (small drips), stains (penetrated into the wood), uniform coatings (rare), and
            buildups (at joints and edges).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil was intentionally applied as a coating. The non-uniformity is caused by variations
            in surface texture, gravity, and the way the oil is introduced to the surface (e.g., drips, splatters, leaks).
        onyx:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a glossy, amber-colored film. As it ages, it darkens, thickens,
            and becomes less reflective. The surface may develop a matte finish or a cracked, crazed appearance. Very old
            buildup can be extremely hard and difficult to remove, resembling tar or asphalt.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) at contact points or edges, then spreads outward
            (days). It thickens gradually over time (weeks/months) due to continued contamination and evaporation of volatile
            components. Layering effects can occur if there are intermittent cleaning attempts or changes in the type of oil/grease
            being used. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #8B4513 (Saddle Brown), transitioning to #A0522D (Sienna) within hours.
            Days old: #654321 (Dark Brown) with hints of #B8860B (Dark Goldenrod) due to oxidation. Months old: #222222 (Very
            Dark Gray) to #000000 (Black) with possible iridescent sheen. Heavily oxidized: #556B2F (Dark Olive Green) due
            to copper corrosion products from bearing alloys.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools in horizontal crevices. It
            tends to accumulate around edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Point sources of contamination,
            like leaking seals, create radial spreading patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity and
            drip accumulation. Edges and corners often have higher concentrations due to surface tension. Crevices and low-lying
            areas act as collection points. Exposed areas may have lower concentrations due to weathering and cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-10 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy coating, slight darkening of the surface (10-50 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, distinct
            color change, some areas still visible (50-200 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, most of the surface obscured
            (200-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, encrusted layer, completely obscuring the surface (>500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on onyx typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that dulls the
            stone's natural luster. The color ranges from dark amber to almost black, depending on age and concentration.
            It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, creating a mottled or streaked appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), pooling (horizontal
            surfaces), edge accumulation (perimeter of components), radial spreading (from point sources), streaky/linear
            (due to wiping or flow), and patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal). The specific pattern depends heavily
            on the source and method of contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on horizontal
            surfaces. This is because the oil/grease tends to spread outward from the edges and then settle in the center.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due
            to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence due to thin-film
            interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the dark, dull appearance of aged buildup. The contrast
            between clean and contaminated areas is more pronounced under oblique lighting.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slippery to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as volatile components evaporate. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it hardens into a crusty or gummy residue.
            Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific additives present.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup in crevices. Drip marks can be paper-thin (50-100 μm) at the top and coin-thick (2-3
            mm) at the bottom.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical runs), runs/streaks (linear flow), pools/puddles
            (horizontal accumulation), thin films (initial coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), and buildups (layered accumulation).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the onyx surface was deliberately coated. Variations are caused by uneven application,
            gravity, surface geometry, and localized sources of contamination.
        palladium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often with an oily sheen. Over time, the oil
            oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darkening in color and an increase in viscosity. Aged contamination is
            typically thicker, drier, and more brittle, often forming a hard, crusty layer. The color shifts from amber to
            dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, this film
            thickens and becomes more visible, starting at contact points and edges. Over weeks and months, the oil oxidizes
            and polymerizes, leading to a darker color and a crustier texture. Buildup can occur uniformly, but more often
            it starts at edges and spreads inward, or originates from point sources and expands outward. Layering effects
            can occur with repeated applications or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the
            rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with light amber tones (#F0C808)'
          - 'Light Buildup: Dark amber to light brown (#A0785A)'
          - 'Moderate Buildup: Medium brown to dark brown (#654321)'
          - 'Heavy Buildup: Dark brown to black (#000000) with hints of reddish-brown (#8B4513) in oxidized areas'
          - 'Aged Buildup: Matte black (#000000) with potential for rust-orange (#B7410E) discoloration due to oxidation of
            metallic additives.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It commonly accumulates in low-lying areas, crevices, and edges
            due to gravity and surface tension. Streaks and drip marks are often visible on vertical surfaces. Areas exposed
            to higher temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom surfaces and crevices accumulate more oil due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation
            or removal by airflow. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, while horizontal surfaces tend to have more
            uniform pooling.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              typical_thickness: '>100 μm'
              visual_appearance: Complete surface encasement with a thick, crusty layer. The Palladium surface is no longer
                visible.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              typical_thickness: 25-100 μm
              visual_appearance: Thick, opaque coating that significantly obscures the Palladium surface. Drip marks and pooling
                may be present.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              typical_thickness: 2-5 μm
              visual_appearance: Thin, patchy film with some visible color change. Palladium surface is still largely visible.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              typical_thickness: 5-25 μm
              visual_appearance: More continuous film with a noticeable color change. Palladium surface is partially obscured.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              typical_thickness: 1-2 μm
              visual_appearance: Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film. Palladium surface is mostly clean.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on palladium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a dark brown to black
            coloration. Coverage varies greatly depending on exposure and operating conditions, ranging from sparse spotting
            to complete surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices
            or low spots), and radial patterns (around rotating components).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This is especially
            noticeable in areas with sharp corners or edges.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools
            on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface
            tension. It follows contours of the surface. It may bridge small gaps due to surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and low points. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil may hang from overhead surfaces as droplets before dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a strong specular reflection, appearing glossy and reflective.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations and surface texture more clearly. Aged oil tends to have
            a matte finish, with less specular reflection. Iridescence may be present in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. As the oil ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and
            tacky. With further aging and the accumulation of particulate matter, the surface becomes rough, crusty, and potentially
            hard. The presence of ZDDP can contribute to a slightly crystalline or powdery surface texture in some areas.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5
            mm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged and oxidized oil),
            discrete patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or localized leaks), stains (penetration into porous
            surfaces), uniform coatings (rare, but possible with controlled application), and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            The non-uniformity is caused by factors such as gravity, surface tension, temperature gradients, localized wear,
            and the method of oil application.
        pcb:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, transparent or light amber film. Over time (weeks/months),
            it darkens due to oxidation and polymerization, becoming more viscous and sticky. The thickness increases as more
            contaminants accumulate. Aged contamination often forms a hard, crusty layer that is difficult to remove. Color
            shifts towards darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or edges. It then thickens
            over time as more contaminants accumulate. The contamination may begin at edges and move inward, or it may spread
            outward from point sources. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than localized buildup. Layering effects
            can occur if there are multiple contamination events. Timeframes vary, but noticeable buildup can occur within
            days, with significant accumulation over months.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C27B), almost transparent. Initial oxidation: Yellowish-brown
            (#A0785A). Moderate buildup: Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges. Aged/oxidized: Dark brown to almost black
            (#301900), sometimes with a reddish tint (#B7410E) due to corrosion products.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots around components, streaks from fluid flow, and accumulation
            in low-lying areas and crevices. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more contamination due to surface tension
            effects and airflow patterns. Uniform coatings are rare unless the PCB was submerged or sprayed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Top surfaces may have more buildup than bottom surfaces if the contamination source is above. Crevices
            and low-lying areas accumulate more oil/grease. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or wiping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, transparent
            film, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Visible brown coating, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark
            brown layer, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, thickness >100 μm, potentially exceeding
            1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PCBs typically presents as a viscous, often dark-colored coating that
            can range from a barely visible sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually a shade of brown or amber,
            darkening with age and oxidation. Coverage patterns are highly variable, influenced by PCB orientation and environmental
            factors.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), Point source spreading (originating from component leaks), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), Patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to airflow or splashing), Streaky/linear (caused by fluid
            flow), Localized concentrations (around specific components or connectors).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to wick along the edges of components and the PCB itself. This effect
            is more pronounced on PCBs with rough or porous edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours of components. It can bridge small gaps between
            components.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is common, resulting in pooling at bottom
            edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is often observed. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes are typical. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to surface
            tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker areas of buildup. Aged contamination usually has a matte finish due to
            oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes be observed
            in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Fresh oil/grease feels slippery and viscous. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            Heavy buildup can form a crusty or gummy texture. Microscopic examination may reveal a non-uniform surface with
            varying degrees of smoothness and roughness, depending on the presence of particulate matter and oxidation products.
            It can also appear slightly crystalline in some areas due to additive precipitation.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-2
            mm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 5 mm or more, especially in areas with repeated exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged contamination), Discrete
            patches (localized spills), Spots/dots (splatter), Stains (penetration into porous materials), Buildups (around
            components), No crystalline structures are typically observed with this type of contamination.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, airflow patterns, component
            placement, and the source of contamination.
        peek:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, glossy, light amber to brown. Aged contamination (months/years):
            Thick, matte, dark brown to black. The surface becomes less reflective and may exhibit a cracked or crazed appearance.
            Thickness increases significantly, and the material becomes harder and more difficult to remove.'
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or lubrication points, then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion or edge accumulation. Layering
            effects can occur with intermittent lubrication or cleaning cycles. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to honey-colored (#E4D00A). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#3B3131) to almost black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges due to oxidation products.
            Heavily oxidized areas can exhibit a dull, grayish-brown (#808080).'
          common_patterns: 'Accumulation is often non-uniform. Common patterns include: localized spots around lubrication
            points, streaks from dripping or flow, buildup along edges and in corners, and a general darkening of surfaces
            exposed to the oil/grease mist. Crevices and areas with poor ventilation tend to accumulate more.'
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension and reduced airflow. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered
            areas trap more oil/grease. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating. Vertical walls exhibit
            drip marks and streaks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film, light amber color, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous film, darker brown color,
            15-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark brown to black coating, visible buildup, 50-200 μm thick. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, black, crusty coating, significant buildup, >200 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PEEK typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially, it
            appears as a thin, glossy film, progressing to a thicker, matte layer with a dark brown to black coloration. Coverage
            varies from localized spots to extensive coatings, often concentrated in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (from flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and
            radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there compared to the center.
            This is especially noticeable on flat surfaces and around the perimeter of components.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours. It can bridge small gaps. It fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on
            horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming small droplets
            or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and thickens, the
            sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting highlights the color variations,
            making darker areas more prominent. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference
            effects.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Aged: Sticky, tacky, and may develop a slightly
            rough or crusty surface due to oxidation and polymerization. Can feel waxy or even slightly gritty if abrasive
            particles are present. At high magnification, may show a slightly uneven, undulating surface.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters in localized areas.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (uneven
            application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the PEEK surface, though rare), uniform coatings
            (rare), and buildups (localized accumulations).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, operating conditions (temperature,
            pressure, speed), and the geometry of the PEEK component. Areas with high shear or frequent cleaning tend to have
            less buildup.
        pet:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, transparent film with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens
            in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Oxidation and polymerization lead to the formation of a hardened,
            crusty layer that is less soluble and more difficult to remove. The surface may become dull and lose its original
            gloss.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin film then thickens over time. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            points) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward due to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects are
            observed with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate
            of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes: Hours (initial film formation), days (noticeable discoloration and thickening),
            months (hardened crust formation).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to golden yellow (#FFD700). Aged contamination: Dark
            amber (#795548) to burnt umber (#8A3324) to near black (#000000) with possible iridescent sheens. Heavily oxidized
            areas can exhibit a reddish-brown hue (#A52A2A).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks are common, especially near machinery or lubrication points. Accumulation
            often occurs along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces. Drip marks and runs are frequently observed
            on vertical surfaces. Over time, a more uniform coating may develop.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravity and capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination sources often exhibit higher concentrations
            than sheltered areas. Corners and low points tend to accumulate more buildup than flat surfaces. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to downward flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film,
            thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, visible
            layer, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup, thickness > 100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PET typically presents as a discolored, often sticky or tacky layer,
            ranging from a barely visible sheen to a thick, crusty coating. The color varies from light amber to dark brown
            or black, depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage can be uniform or highly localized,
            influenced by surface geometry and environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution), streaky/linear (due to flow
            or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points), and uniform coating (after prolonged exposure).
            Point source spreading and localized concentrations are the most frequently observed patterns.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. Also concentrates
            in center areas if the contamination source is located there. Distributes uniformly only after prolonged exposure
            and even spreading. Avoids edges only in specific cases where the surface energy of the PET is significantly lower
            than the contaminant.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the PET surface. Bridges gaps between adjacent surfaces. Fills depressions and low
            points.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is prominent on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading
            to thicker buildup. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. Hangs from overhead surfaces, forming
            stalactite-like formations in extreme cases. The downward flow rate varies depending on the viscosity of the contaminant
            and the surface tension of the PET.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a glossy or oily sheen under direct lighting. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish due to surface oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. Iridescence
            or a rainbow effect may be observed in thin films due to interference effects. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends
            to highlight the yellow/amber tones, while direct sunlight emphasizes the darker brown/black hues.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, smooth, and slightly sticky to the touch. Aged: Tacky, gummy, or hardened with a
            crusty or waxy feel. Can exhibit a fine granular texture due to oxidation and polymerization. In extreme cases,
            a brittle, cracked surface may form.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters in thickness.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks and runs/streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Pools/puddles form on horizontal
            surfaces and in depressions. Thin films are typical of fresh contamination. Thick crusts develop over time due
            to oxidation and polymerization. Discrete patches and spots/dots are often observed near lubrication points. Stains
            are common after cleaning attempts. Uniform coatings can occur after prolonged exposure. Buildups are common in
            areas with high contamination rates.
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Fresh contamination may be mostly uniform with minor variations
            in thickness. Aged contamination is often moderately patchy due to uneven oxidation and the accumulation of particulate
            matter. Highly variable/irregular distribution is common in areas with complex geometry or fluctuating environmental
            conditions. The uniformity level is primarily influenced by the application method, surface roughness, and environmental
            factors.
        phenolic resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) darkens significantly, becoming a dark brown or black, and the texture changes from
            oily to tacky to crusty. The thickness also increases over time, forming a noticeable layer.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: (1) Starts as a thin, almost invisible film upon initial contact
            (hours). (2) Accumulates at contact points (e.g., edges, crevices) and spreads outwards (days). (3) Thickens gradually,
            changing color from light amber to dark brown (weeks). (4) Hardens and forms a crusty layer due to oxidation and
            polymerization (months). (5) May exhibit layering effects if there are intermittent contamination events. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh oil: #D4A373 (light amber). Slightly aged: #A0785A (medium amber, slightly darker). Moderately
            aged: #70533F (dark amber/light brown). Heavily aged: #4A372A (dark brown, almost black). Oxidized/heat-affected:
            #59370B (burnt umber).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and in crevices. Splatter patterns from machinery are also frequently observed. A gradient of thickness
            is often present, with thicker deposits closer to the source of the contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            surface tension. Top surfaces may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to a thicker, dirtier layer. Vertical
            walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with heavier concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate
            more oil due to reduced evaporation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, thin film, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): noticeable
            sheen, slight discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): distinct amber/brown color, tacky feel, thickness
            5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): dark brown/black color, crusty texture, thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): thick, hardened
            layer, significant buildup, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on phenolic resin composites typically presents as a dark, viscous coating,
            ranging from amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a thin, oily film to a thick, tacky or even crusty layer,
            depending on age and exposure. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with accumulation in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), point source spreading (radiating outwards from a leak or spill), gradient from source (decreasing thickness
            with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to inconsistent exposure), streaky/linear
            (caused by dripping or wiping), and localized concentrations (in crevices or around fasteners). Edge accumulation
            and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices on phenolic
            resin composites. This is primarily due to surface tension and capillary action, which draw the oil towards these
            areas. The oil tends to spread outwards from these points, but the highest concentration remains at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces lead to dripping. Edges act as collection points.
            Contours influence the flow and distribution of the oil. Depressions fill with oil, creating localized buildups.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and oxidizes, the sheen diminishes,
            and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the coating
            and any drip marks or streaks. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily, feeling slippery to the touch. As it ages, it becomes
            tacky and viscous, then increasingly sticky. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty
            or even slightly brittle layer. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly granular or amorphous structure,
            especially in heavily oxidized areas.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in areas of prolonged accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (similar to drip marks
            but less defined), pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (early stage contamination), thick crusts (aged,
            oxidized oil), discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated
            into the phenolic resin surface), and uniform coatings (rare, but possible in controlled environments).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface geometry, airflow patterns, and the
            location of contamination sources.
        pine:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, translucent film, amber color, oily texture. Aged contamination
            (months/years): Thick, opaque layer, dark brown to black color, hardened and crusty texture. Oxidation products
            may form a reddish-brown surface layer. The grease becomes more difficult to remove and penetrates deeper into
            the wood.'
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins at contact points (leaks, spills)
            and spreads outward. Accumulation is faster at edges initially, then moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is rare; point sources expanding outward are more common. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination.
            Seasonal variations in temperature can affect viscosity and spread.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#F0D58D), Lightly Aged: Honey brown (#C89B3F), Moderately Aged: Dark
            brown (#654321), Heavily Aged: Black (#000000) with hints of reddish-brown (#A52A2A) oxidation products, Oxidized/Weathered:
            Matte grayish-brown (#808080).'
          common_patterns: Accumulates in low-lying areas, crevices, and along the grain of the pine. Drip marks are common
            on vertical surfaces. Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks, which then spread and
            coalesce over time. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more grease due to surface tension and gravity.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and pooling.
            Bottom surfaces tend to accumulate more grease due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying areas also exhibit higher
            concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient from top to bottom, with heavier accumulation at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            sheen, amber color, 5-20 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Darker brown color, tacky texture, 20-100 μm thickness.
            Heavy (60-85%): Opaque, dark brown to black, crusty texture, 100-500 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick, black,
            hardened layer, >500 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on pine presents as a viscous, darkening stain that gradually permeates
            the wood grain. Initially, it appears as a light sheen, progressing to a thick, tacky layer with a characteristic
            burnt odor. The color shifts from translucent amber to dark brown or even black over time, especially in areas
            with heavy accumulation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Point source spreading
            (from leaks or spills), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with
            distance), Patchy/spotty (initial contamination), Streaky/linear (following wood grain). Edge accumulation and
            point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The grease
            tends to flow towards the edges and corners, creating a thicker layer in these areas. The center areas may have
            a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices, filling them completely.
            Pools on flat areas, creating a thicker layer. Drips on vertical surfaces, forming drip marks. Collects at edges,
            creating a raised ridge. Follows contours of the wood grain.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            Grease tends to settle on horizontal surfaces, creating a thicker layer.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations and surface texture more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish, reducing reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming tacky and sticky. Over time, it can harden into a crusty or
            gummy texture, especially with exposure to air and heat. The surface can exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, transitioning
            to a matte or semi-gloss finish as it ages and oxidizes. Close inspection may reveal fine particulate matter trapped
            within the grease layer.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm, Light buildup: 10-50 μm, Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm, Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 1 mm, Extreme buildup: >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (following wood grain), Pools/puddles (in low-lying
            areas), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged contamination), Discrete patches (localized spills),
            Stains (penetration into the wood), Buildups (at edges and corners).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to the porous
            nature of pine, variations in surface texture, and the influence of gravity. The uniformity level is primarily
            determined by the source of contamination and the duration of exposure.
        plaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, glossy film with a light tan or yellowish-brown
            color. Aged contamination (months/years old) darkens to a dark brown or black color, thickens into a crusty or
            waxy layer, and loses its glossy sheen. The aged buildup is often harder to remove and may be accompanied by a
            musty or rancid odor.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or near the source of contamination
            (hours). It then spreads outward, following the contours of the surface (days). Edges and crevices accumulate
            contaminant more rapidly due to surface tension (days-weeks). Over time, the film thickens and hardens, forming
            a crusty layer (weeks-months). Layering effects may occur due to repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and the consistency of the contaminant (months-years).
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light tan (#D2B48C) to yellowish-brown (#A0785A). Moderately aged: Medium
            brown (#8B4513) with hints of orange. Heavily aged: Dark brown (#654321) to almost black (#221E1F) in extreme
            cases. Oxidized areas may exhibit a reddish-brown hue similar to burnt sienna (#E97451). Areas exposed to UV light
            may bleach to a lighter, chalky tan.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, forming drip marks, streaks, and pools. Edges and crevices tend
            to collect more contaminant due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform
            coating, while vertical surfaces show downward flow patterns. Point sources of contamination lead to radial spreading
            patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges
            and corners also exhibit higher concentrations due to surface tension. Crevices and depressions act as collection
            points. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform concentration, but still vary depending on proximity to the source.
            Sheltered areas may accumulate more contaminant than exposed areas due to reduced evaporation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible discoloration, scattered spots and streaks, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration, more extensive coverage with drip marks and pooling, thickness 10-100 μm.
            Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, thick layer with crusty texture, extensive pooling and drip marks,
            thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, very thick crusty layer, significant buildup and
            pooling, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on plaster presents as a discoloration ranging from light tan to dark
            brown, often with a slightly glossy or matte sheen depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. The
            texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty accumulation, typically concentrated
            in areas prone to drips or contact.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Drip marks on vertical surfaces, characterized
            by linear streaks running downwards. 2) Edge accumulation, where the contaminant concentrates along edges and
            corners. 3) Point source spreading, resulting in a radial pattern emanating from the source. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution, especially in areas with uneven surfaces or localized contamination. 5) Streaky/linear patterns
            caused by wiping or cleaning attempts.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The contaminant tends to wick along edges, creating a darker and thicker band compared to
            the center areas. This effect is more pronounced on porous surfaces like plaster. The center areas may have a
            thinner, more uniform coating, but the edges will always exhibit a higher concentration.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Contaminant accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface. It can
            bridge gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior,
            resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation
            of gravity's influence. Contaminant settles on horizontal surfaces, forming pools or puddles. It runs down slopes,
            following the path of least resistance. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures
            in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and texture differences. Aged contamination typically has a matte
            finish and reflects less light. Depending on the composition, iridescent or rainbow effects may be visible in
            thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels slightly oily or sticky to the touch. As it ages, it becomes more viscous
            and can develop a tacky or gummy consistency. Over time, it hardens and forms a crusty or waxy layer. At high
            magnification (100x), particulate matter and oxidation products may be visible, creating a slightly rough surface.
            The surface can range from smooth and glossy when fresh to rough and matte when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for fresh contamination to a heavy buildup of 0.5-2
            mm or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several millimeters in thickness, resembling
            a thick crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks: elongated streaks running down vertical surfaces.
            2) Runs/streaks: similar to drip marks but often wider and less defined. 3) Pools/puddles: accumulation of contaminant
            in depressions or on horizontal surfaces. 4) Thin films: a barely visible layer covering the surface. 5) Thick
            crusts: hardened layers of aged contamination. 6) Discrete patches: isolated areas of contamination. 7) Stains:
            discoloration of the plaster caused by the contaminant.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, gravity, airflow, and the
            location of the contamination source. Areas closer to the source or in the path of drips will have higher concentrations.
        platinum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens
            in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination forms a hard, crusty layer that is difficult
            to remove. Oxidation products may appear as a dull, greyish surface layer on top of the darker, underlying grease.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours). It begins at contact points and edges, then spreads
            outward (days). Accumulation is often non-uniform, with thicker deposits forming in areas of high friction or
            heat. Over months, the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, forming a thicker, darker, and more crusty layer. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated applications of lubricant. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect the rate
            of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Translucent amber (#FFBF00 to #FF8000), Iridescent sheen. Lightly aged:
            Yellowish-brown (#A07A49). Moderately aged: Dark brown (#654321), Burnt Sienna (#E97451). Heavily aged: Black
            (#000000) with possible greyish (#808080) oxidation products.'
          common_patterns: Initially forms a thin, even film. Accumulates preferentially in low-lying areas, crevices, and
            edges due to surface tension and gravity. Over time, it tends to form drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools
            on horizontal surfaces. Heat accelerates polymerization and crust formation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces of horizontal areas accumulate more due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas
            also tend to have higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top (lighter) to bottom (heavier)
            due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often iridescent. Thickness: <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, translucent coating with some visible color. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Opaque coating with visible
            texture. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant buildup. Thickness: 25-100 μm.
            Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty deposit, potentially obscuring the underlying platinum surface. Thickness:
            >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on platinum typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tarry deposit. The color is initially a translucent amber, darkening
            to shades of brown and black with age and exposure to heat and oxidation. The texture varies from smooth and oily
            to rough and crusty depending on the severity and age of the contamination.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Uniform coating (initial stage), Edge accumulation (due to surface
            tension), Point source spreading (from lubrication points), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Pooling (on horizontal
            surfaces), Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), Streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping). Edge accumulation
            and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat center areas. This is especially pronounced
            in areas with sharp corners or raised edges. The mechanism is related to minimizing the surface energy of the
            liquid.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, filling them
            completely. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due
            to surface tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps between closely spaced components.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical
            surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Drip marks form from top to bottom on vertical
            surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from
            overhead surfaces is possible with very viscous grease.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen under direct lighting. As the contamination ages and
            oxidizes, the surface becomes more matte. Thin films may exhibit iridescence due to interference effects. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the yellow/brown tones, while direct sunlight emphasizes the darker, oxidized
            areas.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, slippery to the touch. Lightly aged: Slightly tacky, viscous. Moderately
            aged: Sticky, gummy, may contain fine particulate matter. Heavily aged: Hard, crusty, brittle, may exhibit a rough,
            granular surface due to oxidation and polymerization. Can feel like dried varnish.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 0.1-5 μm. Light buildup: 5-25 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm
            - 1 mm or more.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), Thin films (initial stage), Thick crusts (aged contamination), Discrete patches
            (uneven application), Spots/dots (splatter or localized wear), Stains (penetration into porous areas), Uniform
            coatings (initial stage), Buildups (accumulated deposits).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically NOT perfectly uniform. It ranges from mostly uniform with minor
            variations (early stages) to moderately patchy (moderate buildup) to highly variable/irregular (heavy buildup).
            Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface temperature, lubricant application, and wear patterns.
        plywood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light brown in color. Over time, it darkens
            and thickens, becoming more matte and crusty. Aged contamination can exhibit a cracked or crazed surface due to
            oxidation and polymerization. The buildup becomes harder to remove and may penetrate deeper into the wood grain.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., drips) and spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible but less common. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D2B48C (tan) to #A0785A (raw umber). Intermediate: #8B4513 (saddle brown)
            with hints of #C04000 (burnt sienna) at thicker points. Aged contamination: #4A3020 (dark brown) to #22190F (black-brown),
            often with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and in crevices. Point source contamination often results in a radial spreading pattern. Uniform coatings
            are rare, except in cases of deliberate application.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and pooling.
            Bottom edges of vertical surfaces often exhibit heavier buildup due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying areas accumulate
            more contamination than flat surfaces. Exposed areas may experience some weathering and reduced buildup compared
            to sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible film, thickness <10 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct patches and streaks, thicker
            film, thickness 50-150 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant darkening, crusty buildup, thickness 150-500 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Almost complete coverage, thick, hardened crust, thickness >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on plywood presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a slightly tacky film to a thick, hardened crust,
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with accumulation
            in low-lying areas and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to capillary action and surface
            tension), point source spreading (from leaks or spills), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or localized contamination), and localized
            concentrations (in crevices or low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along the wood grain towards the edges. While the center may
            also be contaminated, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips occur on vertical surfaces. It collects at
            edges due to capillary action. It may bridge small gaps or fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but less
            common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the buildup. Aged contamination typically has a matte finish and
            reflects less light. Iridescence is not typically observed unless specific additives are present in the oil/grease.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slightly sticky to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes
            more viscous and tacky, eventually hardening into a crusty or waxy solid. Close inspection may reveal a slightly
            uneven surface with small ridges or ripples, especially in areas of heavy accumulation. The plywood grain may
            be partially obscured.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. Average thickness in moderate contamination scenarios is typically 50-200 μm.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled surfaces), pools/puddles
            (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches
            (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into wood), and buildups (layered accumulation).
            Drip marks and thin films are most common initially, progressing to crusts and buildups over time.
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, porosity of the plywood,
            the method of contamination (e.g., drips vs. spray), and gravity.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks
            to months), it darkens to a brown or black color due to oxidation and polymerization. The texture changes from
            oily to sticky to hard and crusty. Thickness increases with continued exposure.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days to weeks). It
            often begins at contact points or edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less
            common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and hardening. Months to years
            result in thick, hardened deposits.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F5DEB3) with a slight yellow tint'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#A07A44)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B4513) with reddish undertones'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#4E342E) with blackish patches due to oxidation'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Black (#000000) in extreme cases'
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, edges, and crevices due
            to gravity and surface tension. Splatter patterns and drip marks are common near machinery or lubrication points.
            Flat surfaces tend to have a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravity and surface tension. Top surfaces exposed to direct spray or leaks tend to have higher concentrations
            than sheltered areas. Corners and crevices act as collection points. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks,
            resulting in a gradient from top to bottom.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, hardened crust with extensive buildup. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Completely covered in a thick, dark, and often cracked crust.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, opaque coating with significant buildup. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Dark brown or black coating, thick and crusty in places.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, translucent film with some visible accumulation in crevices. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Slightly greasy appearance, visible streaks and spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Opaque coating with noticeable accumulation in edges and corners. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Visible brown or yellow coating, distinct accumulation in crevices.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Barely perceptible sheen, isolated droplets or streaks.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polycarbonate typically presents as a translucent to opaque coating,
            ranging in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a smooth, oily film to a sticky, hardened
            residue, often accumulating in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on flat horizontal surfaces. 2) Edge accumulation
            along seams and borders. 3) Point source spreading from lubrication points. 4) Gradient from source, decreasing
            in thickness with distance. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution due to inconsistent application or localized leaks.
            6) Streaky/linear patterns from drips or runs. Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. It also concentrates in center areas if the source of contamination is located there (e.g.,
            a leak in the middle of a surface). Uniform distribution is rare unless intentionally applied. The mechanism is
            primarily driven by surface tension and gravity.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them over time. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker
            deposits. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, creating a visible border. It
            follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface. It can bridge small gaps, creating a continuous film.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal
            surfaces, creating a more uniform coating. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. It can hang from
            overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Thicker deposits may show some iridescence due to thin-film interference, especially
            with certain additives. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the yellow/brown tones.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup is typically smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky,
            eventually hardening into a waxy or crusty residue. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly granular or
            amorphous structure, depending on the specific oil/grease composition and environmental conditions. The surface
            can be smooth or uneven, depending on the application method and the presence of particulate contaminants.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Initial films can be as thin as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 0.5-2 mm or more, especially in areas of pooling or accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: 1) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 2) Runs/streaks along inclined
            surfaces. 3) Pools/puddles in low-lying areas. 4) Thin films on flat surfaces. 5) Thick crusts in areas of heavy
            accumulation and oxidation. 6) Discrete patches from splatters or leaks. 7) Stains that penetrate the polycarbonate
            surface over long periods. Drip marks, thin films, and thick crusts are most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil/grease was intentionally applied as a coating. Variations are caused by gravity,
            surface tension, airflow, and the location of lubrication points or leaks.
        polyester resin composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, easily wiped away. Over time (weeks/months),
            it thickens, darkens, and becomes more viscous. Dust and debris adhere, creating a matte, grimy surface. Very
            old contamination (years) can harden into a brittle, crusty layer that is difficult to remove. Color shifts from
            amber to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. Begins at contact points (e.g.,
            lubrication points) and spreads outward. Starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is less
            common than point source expansion. Layering effects occur as new oil/grease is deposited on top of existing buildup.
            Seasonal variations in temperature can affect viscosity and spread.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden brown (#964B00). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#3B2F2F) to black (#000000). Oxidized areas: Rust-orange (#B7410E) may appear due to metallic additives.
            Areas with coolant mixing: Milky brown or grey.'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal crevices, accumulation around edges and
            fasteners, and a general darkening of the surface. Point source spreading from lubrication points or leaks. Streaking
            patterns from fluid flow.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavy concentration: Edges, corners, crevices, bottom surfaces (due to gravity), areas
            near lubrication points. Light concentration: Center of flat surfaces, top surfaces, exposed areas subject to
            cleaning or abrasion. Gradient patterns: Decreasing concentration away from the source of contamination.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film, slight darkening of the surface (5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable darkening, visible
            buildup in crevices (25-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, significant buildup (100-500 μm). Extreme
            (>85%): Complete coverage, thick, crusty layer ( >500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polyester resin composites typically presents as a dark, viscous coating
            that ranges in color from amber to dark brown or black. The texture varies from a thin, oily film to a thick,
            sticky or even crusty layer, depending on the age and severity of the contamination. Coverage patterns are often
            non-uniform, with accumulation in crevices, edges, and areas of direct contact.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from leaks), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or localized leaks), streaky/linear (fluid flow), localized concentrations (around fasteners or joints).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to wick along edges and into small gaps. Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially
            on flat surfaces. This is a very common pattern.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners (surface tension), builds up in crevices (difficult to clean), pools on
            flat areas (gravity), drips on vertical surfaces (gravity), collects at edges (surface tension), follows contours
            (fluid flow), bridges gaps (surface tension), fills depressions (gravity and surface tension).
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is prominent, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top
            to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces creates thicker layers. Runs down slopes,
            creating streaks. Hanging from overhead surfaces forms drips.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct light, reflecting light specularly.
            Aged contamination tends to be matte, scattering light diffusely. Rainbow iridescence may be visible in thin films
            due to interference effects, especially with mineral oil-based lubricants. Under UV light, some oil components
            may fluoresce.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, slippery, smooth. Aged: Sticky, tacky, may become crusty or hardened. Can feel gritty
            due to accumulated particulate matter. Surface may exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, becoming matte with age.
            Close inspection may reveal fine particulate inclusions.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-25 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 250 μm - 2 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >2 mm. Varies significantly depending on the source and duration of contamination.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (general coverage), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter),
            stains (penetration into the resin matrix), uniform coatings (rare, usually from intentional application), buildups
            (around joints and fasteners).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically
            concentrated in specific areas near the source of the oil/grease or in areas where it can accumulate due to gravity
            or surface tension. Uniformity depends on the application method (e.g., spray vs. drip) and the surface geometry.
        polyethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, almost invisible film with a slight sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more viscous. It may develop a hard,
            crusty surface and exhibit signs of cracking or flaking. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown or black,
            and the texture becomes increasingly sticky and difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days).
            It often begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward (days/weeks). It can also start
            at edges and move inward (weeks/months). Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common. Point sources
            expand outward, creating radial patterns (weeks/months). Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events
            (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3), almost transparent. Days old: Yellowish-brown (#A0785A).
            Weeks old: Medium brown (#8B4513) with reddish undertones due to oxidation. Months old: Dark brown (#654321) to
            almost black (#000000) in heavily soiled areas. Heavily oxidized/burnt: Black with a hint of green (#36454F).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in recessed areas, and a general
            tendency to accumulate along edges and seams. Initial contamination often appears as a thin, even film, which
            then thickens and becomes more localized over time. Areas exposed to direct contact or high temperatures tend
            to exhibit accelerated buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to be heavier due to surface
            tension effects. Bottom surfaces and crevices accumulate more due to gravity and trapping of contaminants. Flat
            surfaces may have a more uniform, but still variable, coating. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks,
            leading to higher concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to
            a darker, thicker buildup.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and droplets, barely visible film. Thickness: <10 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous
            film with noticeable discoloration and some buildup in crevices. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick,
            dark coating with significant buildup and crust formation. Thickness: 200-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement
            with thick, hardened deposits. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polyethylene typically presents as a viscous, discolored film that
            ranges from a light sheen to a thick, tacky coating. The color is initially light amber, darkening to shades of
            brown and black with age and oxidation. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement, often
            concentrated in low-lying areas and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized contamination),
            streaky/linear (from drips or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points), and radial patterns
            (around rotating parts). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This is especially noticeable on flat surfaces and around openings. The mechanism is driven by the minimization
            of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It builds up in crevices, filling them over time. It pools on flat
            areas, creating thicker deposits. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, creating
            a raised rim. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface. It can bridge gaps, creating a continuous
            film across small openings. It fills depressions, leveling out uneven surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in drip marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Drip marks extend
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits.
            Runs occur down slopes. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces as droplets before eventually dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight oily sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the color variations more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish due to the accumulation
            of particulate matter and oxidation products. Thicker deposits may exhibit a slight gloss, especially when freshly
            applied. Iridescence is not typically observed unless there is a very thin film of oil on a perfectly smooth surface.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky due to oxidation
            and polymerization. With heavy buildup, it can form a crusty or waxy surface. Close inspection may reveal a slightly
            granular texture due to particulate contaminants. Feels slippery when fresh, increasingly gummy and resistant
            to wiping as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-20 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm. Heavy buildup can reach
            'coin-thick' (1-3 mm) in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splatters or localized leaks), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into the polyethylene
            surface), uniform coatings (rare, intentional application), buildups (in corners and crevices), and no crystalline
            structures are typically observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil/grease was intentionally applied as a coating. The non-uniformity is caused
            by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, airflow patterns, and the method of contamination (e.g.,
            drips, splatters, leaks).
        polyimide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often nearly transparent. Over time (weeks
            to months), it darkens in color, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination (months to years) can
            harden into a brittle, crusty layer that is difficult to remove. The surface may exhibit cracking or crazing due
            to thermal stress and oxidation.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points or lubrication points and spreads outward. Edges tend to accumulate contamination faster than center areas.
            Over months, layering effects become visible as new oil/grease is deposited on top of older, oxidized layers.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, #F0C808, almost transparent'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown, #A0785A, translucent'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown, #8B4513, opaque'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black, #301900, opaque with possible reddish hues due to oxidation'
          - 'Thermally Degraded: Black, #000000, often with a matte finish'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots around lubrication points, streaks along sliding surfaces,
            and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is most pronounced in crevices, corners, and areas where the
            polyimide surface is not perfectly smooth. Flat surfaces tend to collect a more uniform, albeit thin, layer of
            contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            accumulation of debris. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity and downward flow.
            Corners and areas of high friction or wear also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls show a gradient
            from top to bottom due to drip marks.

              thickness: <5 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polyimide typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges
            in color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly tacky or sticky texture. The distribution is rarely uniform,
            tending to accumulate in crevices, edges, and areas of high friction or contact. Over time, oxidation and thermal
            degradation can lead to a hardened, crusty surface.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear),
            streaky/linear (along sliding surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners). Point source spreading
            and streaky/linear patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to
            capillary action and surface tension effects. The oil/grease tends to wick along edges, creating a darker, thicker
            line compared to the center areas. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform film.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            from top to bottom. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            runs down slopes. Quantitatively, the flow rate depends on viscosity and surface angle, but visual evidence is
            readily apparent.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Aged, oxidized grease tends to have a matte finish, reducing
            specular reflection. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged
            exposure to heat and oxygen, it can harden into a crusty or gummy residue. At a microscopic level, particulate
            matter (metal wear debris, dirt) may be visible embedded within the grease. The surface can range from glossy
            when fresh to matte when aged and oxidized. Touch can reveal a slight tackiness even when seemingly dry.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on the application and exposure. Thin films can be as
            thin as 1-5 μm, while heavy buildup can reach thicknesses of 0.1-1 mm or more. Typical thicknesses range from
            25-250 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (along sliding
            surfaces), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy buildup and oxidation), discrete patches
            (due to localized wear or contamination), stains (where oil has penetrated the polyimide surface), buildups (in
            corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, localized wear, uneven
            application of lubricant, and gravitational effects.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, almost transparent film. Over time (days to weeks), it darkens
            in color due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. The texture becomes tackier and thicker. After
            months or years, the buildup can become a hard, crusty layer, often with a dark brown or black color. The thickness
            increases significantly with age.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film at contact points (e.g., lubrication points, edges). Over hours,
            it spreads outward, driven by surface tension and gravity. Within days, the film thickens and darkens due to oxidation
            and the accumulation of dirt. Over months, layering effects become visible as new oil deposits on top of older,
            hardened layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can influence the rate of oxidation and the consistency
            of the buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with orange hues (#A0785A)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E), often with a reddish tint due to oxidation products'
          - 'ZDDP Rich: Can exhibit a slight greenish-brown tint (#8F9779) due to the presence of zinc compounds.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running,
            and accumulation in low-lying areas or crevices. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more buildup due to surface
            tension effects. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform coating, while vertical surfaces show drip marks.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Bottom
            surfaces and crevices also accumulate more buildup due to gravity and capillary action. Vertical walls exhibit
            a gradient, with heavier concentrations at the bottom due to dripping. Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust
            and debris, leading to a darker and thicker buildup.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:

              description: 'Isolated spots or droplets, barely visible discoloration. Thickness: <5 μm'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polypropylene typically presents as a discolored, often sticky or
            tacky film. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on age and composition. Coverage can vary
            from sparse spotting to a thick, almost complete coating, often with noticeable accumulation in crevices and along
            edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading (radiating outwards from
            a lubrication point), 2) Edge accumulation (concentrated along edges and corners), 3) Streaky/linear (from dripping
            or running), 4) Patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to inconsistent application or cleaning), 5) Gradient from
            source (decreasing concentration with distance from the source). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            Uniform distribution is rare unless the entire surface was deliberately coated.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            dripping. Edges act as barriers, collecting and concentrating the buildup. Contours influence the flow and distribution
            patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Oil/grease runs down slopes. Overhead surfaces
            may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations of hardened grease. The angle of the surface directly
            influences the rate and direction of flow.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            thicker, the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight
            the discoloration and any unevenness in the coating. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with
            very thin films of fresh oil.
          texture_details: The texture varies with age and composition. Fresh contamination is often smooth and oily to the
            touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes tacky and can develop a slightly rough or even crusty surface. The
            presence of particulate matter (e.g., wear debris) can contribute to a gritty texture. It is generally not crystalline
            or powdery unless heavily oxidized and degraded.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 25-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick'
            layer would be 1-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks from dripping oil), 2) Runs/streaks
            (horizontal or angled streaks from running oil), 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation in low-lying areas), 4) Thin films
            (uniform or patchy coatings), 5) Thick crusts (hardened, aged buildup), 6) Discrete patches (isolated areas of
            contamination), 7) Stains (discoloration of the polypropylene surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the polypropylene surface was intentionally coated. The non-uniformity is caused by
            variations in surface energy, gravity, airflow, and the method of contamination (e.g., splashing, dripping, aerosol
            deposition).
        polystyrene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, transparent or translucent film. Over time (weeks/months), it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. The texture changes from oily to sticky and eventually
            to a hard, crusty residue. Thickness increases significantly with age.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens due to continued deposition and oxidation (days).
            Begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward (days/weeks). Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; point
            sources and edge effects are more common. Layering effects occur with intermittent contamination events (weeks/months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F0C808), Aged (days): Medium Brown (#A67B5B), Heavily Oxidized (months):
            Dark Brown (#654321) with possible blackish (#000000) deposits, Sulfurized Additives: Can impart a greenish-brown
            hue (#808000), ZDDP rich areas: May show a slight iridescent sheen.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation often starts at edges and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. On
            flat surfaces, it can form a relatively uniform coating, but with variations in thickness. Drip marks are common
            on vertical surfaces. Point source contamination spreads radially.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action. Top
            surfaces exposed to dust and debris tend to have higher concentrations of particulate matter embedded in the grease.
            Vertical surfaces show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity-induced flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): Noticeable sheen, slight
            discoloration, 5-15 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct coating, visible discoloration, 15-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, opaque layer, significant discoloration, 50-200 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, dark color,
            >200 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on polystyrene typically appears as a viscous, often discolored coating.
            Initially, it presents as a thin, glossy film, progressing to a thicker, matte layer with a tacky or slightly
            sticky texture. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on the oil's age and composition.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Uniform coating (light contamination), Edge accumulation (due to
            surface tension), Point source spreading (from leaks or spills), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Streaky/linear
            (due to wiping or flow), Localized concentrations (in crevices or low spots).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends
            to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat center surfaces. This is especially pronounced in corners and along
            seams.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and reduced airflow. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges due to capillary action. Follows contours
            of the surface. Fills depressions and low spots.
          gravity_influence: Significant downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks. Settling on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes, creating streaks.
            Hanging from overhead surfaces as droplets before dripping.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil exhibits a glossy sheen under direct light. As it ages and oxidizes, the surface becomes
            more matte. Under fluorescent lighting, the color appears less saturated. Heavily contaminated areas may exhibit
            a slight iridescence due to thin-film interference, especially with ZDDP additives.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming tacky and slightly sticky as it oxidizes. With heavy buildup,
            it can form a crusty or waxy layer. Microscopic examination may reveal a non-uniform surface with small particulate
            matter embedded within the grease matrix. Feels slightly rough to the touch when aged.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm, Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm, Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm, Extreme buildup: >2
            mm. Varies significantly based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (due to gravity), Pools/puddles (on horizontal
            surfaces), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged, heavy contamination), Discrete patches (localized
            spills), Stains (penetration into the polystyrene surface, especially with solvents).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity depends on the application method and environmental
            conditions. Spray application may result in a more uniform coating initially, but gravity and surface tension
            will eventually lead to variations. Crevices and edges will always have higher concentrations.
        polytetrafluoroethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Aged contamination
            (months/years) is thicker, darker, and more opaque. The texture changes from smooth to sticky or crusty. The color
            darkens significantly, and the buildup becomes more difficult to remove. Cracking and flaking may occur in extreme
            cases.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or lubrication points and spreads outwards. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur
            with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation
            and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent light amber (#F0E68C) or pale yellow. As it
            oxidizes, it transitions to a medium brown (#A67B5B), then a dark reddish-brown (#8B4513), and finally, after
            extended exposure and thermal cycling, can become almost black (#000000) in heavily contaminated areas. Some sulfurized
            additives can impart a greenish-brown hue (#556B2F).
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include localized spots near lubrication points,
            streaks from dripping or splashing, and accumulation along edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Flat surfaces tend to collect a more even film, while vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas often accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom
            due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (thickness < 5 μm). Light
            (10-30%): Thin, translucent film with some visible streaks and spots (thickness 5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with some areas of bare PTFE still visible (thickness 25-75 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating
            with minimal bare PTFE (thickness 75-200 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty coating completely obscuring
            the PTFE surface (thickness > 200 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PTFE typically presents as a mottled, uneven coating ranging from
            light tan to dark brown. The surface often appears slightly glossy when fresh, becoming more matte and textured
            as it ages and oxidizes. Coverage varies greatly depending on the application and exposure conditions, but often
            concentrates in low points and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading: Oil originates from a lubrication
            point and spreads outwards. 2) Edge accumulation: Oil collects along edges due to surface tension. 3) Streaky/linear:
            Drip marks or runs down vertical surfaces. 4) Patchy/spotty: Uneven distribution due to inconsistent application
            or exposure. 5) Gradient from source: Concentration decreases with distance from the source of contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil tends to migrate towards the edges and form a thicker layer there. This is especially noticeable
            on flat surfaces. The mechanism is related to the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It pools on flat areas. It drips on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to surface
            tension. It follows contours. It bridges small gaps. It fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Oil
            pools at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Oil
            can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight oily sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the coating. Aged contamination usually has a matte finish. Iridescence
            is not typically observed unless the film thickness is very thin and uniform (rare).
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup feels slightly oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky
            and tacky due to oxidation and polymerization. With heavy buildup and thermal cycling, it can develop a crusty,
            slightly rough texture, sometimes exhibiting a fine granular structure visible under magnification (10x-20x).
            It is not crystalline or powdery.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a barely perceptible film (less than 1 μm) to heavy buildup exceeding 500
            μm (0.5 mm) in extreme cases. Typical thickness in industrial settings ranges from 10 μm to 200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: A barely perceptible layer of oil. 2) Drip marks:
            Vertical streaks caused by oil running down surfaces. 3) Runs/streaks: Similar to drip marks, but often wider
            and less defined. 4) Pools/puddles: Accumulation of oil in low points. 5) Thick crusts: Hardened layers of oxidized
            oil. 6) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of contamination. 7) Stains: Discoloration of the PTFE surface caused
            by oil penetration.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, localized contamination sources,
            and the effects of gravity and airflow.
        polyvinyl chloride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight oily sheen. Aged contamination
            becomes darker, thicker, and more opaque. The surface may develop a cracked or crazed appearance due to repeated
            heating and cooling cycles. The texture transitions from oily to sticky to hard and crusty.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. It begins at contact points (e.g.,
            drips, leaks) and then spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Over days, the
            film thickens and becomes more visible. Over weeks and months, oxidation causes darkening and hardening. Layering
            effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect
            the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A300D (Dark Olive Brown), almost transparent. Days old: #60411F (Dark
            Brown) with a slight sheen. Weeks old: #7B532B (Medium Brown) with darkening edges. Months old: #33292A (Very
            Dark Brown) to #000000 (Black) with a matte finish. Heavily oxidized: #544E47 (Grayish Brown) with a dry appearance.'
          common_patterns: The buildup often starts as localized spots or streaks near the source of the contamination. It
            then spreads outwards, following the contours of the PVC surface. Accumulation is typically heavier in areas where
            oil/grease can pool, such as horizontal surfaces and crevices. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more oil/grease than vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Corners and low points also exhibit higher concentrations. Exposed areas may experience some removal due to airflow
            or cleaning, while sheltered areas accumulate more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible film, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%): thin, translucent
            coating, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable brown coating, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            thick, dark brown to black coating, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): very thick, tar-like layer, thickness
            > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PVC typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, barely visible film to a thick, almost tar-like layer. The color is usually dark brown or black, with
            a slightly glossy or matte finish depending on the age and oxidation level. It tends to accumulate in crevices
            and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points),
            and drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, thicker line. This effect is more pronounced
            on rougher PVC surfaces. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating drip marks.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs on
            vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible but
            less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight oily sheen or gloss. As the contamination
            ages and oxidizes, the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness
            of the buildup. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with very thin films of fresh oil.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slippery to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as oxidation occurs. With prolonged exposure and heat, it can harden into a crusty, almost brittle layer. At a
            microscopic level, it may exhibit a slightly granular or uneven surface due to the presence of particulate contaminants.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-20 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 5-10 mm in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (uneven
            application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the PVC surface), and buildups (in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, gravity, airflow, and the
            source of the contamination. Areas near the source will be much heavier than areas further away.
        poplar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light, oily stain. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens and
            thickens due to oxidation and polymerization. The surface becomes less glossy and more matte. Aged buildup is
            often harder and more difficult to remove. Cracking and crazing may occur in thick deposits. The color shifts
            towards darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It begins at contact points
            (e.g., near machinery) and spreads outwards. Edges tend to accumulate oil faster than center areas. Over time
            (days to weeks), the film thickens and darkens. Layering effects may occur due to repeated exposure. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup. The process is continuous, with oil constantly
            accumulating and oxidizing.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D2B48C (tan) to #A0785A (raw umber). Aged contamination: #8B4513 (saddle
            brown) to #654321 (dark brown) with localized areas of #22190F (jet black) due to oxidation and carbonization.
            Heavily contaminated areas may exhibit a slight greenish-black sheen due to sulfurized additives. Initial staining
            may appear as #F5DEB3 (wheat) before darkening.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is most prominent along edges, in crevices, and around fasteners. Drip marks are common
            on vertical surfaces. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform coating. Splatter patterns may be present
            near machinery. Areas exposed to direct oil spray exhibit heavier, more concentrated buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces than vertical surfaces due to
            settling. Edges and corners tend to accumulate more oil than flat surfaces due to surface tension. Crevices and
            imperfections act as traps for oil and debris. Top surfaces exposed to direct oil spray are heavier than sheltered
            undersides. The concentration decreases with distance from the oil source.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and stains, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches and streaks, easily visible. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage with
            visible buildup in some areas. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with thick deposits.
            Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with very thick, hardened deposits. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on poplar presents as a darkening stain, ranging from light amber to
            dark brown, often with a slightly tacky or waxy texture. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface
            coating, depending on exposure and duration. The buildup tends to accentuate the wood grain and any surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: 1) Gradient from source: Heaviest near the oil source, thinning
            out with distance. 2) Edge accumulation: Buildup along edges and corners due to surface tension. 3) Drip marks:
            Vertical streaks from oil running down surfaces. 4) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution due to uneven application
            or splashing. 5) Uniform coating: On surfaces directly exposed to oil mist.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension.
            The oil tends to creep along edges, forming a thicker layer than in the center. This effect is most pronounced
            on sharp edges and corners. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces.
            The mechanism is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas
            tend to pool oil. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges act as barriers, preventing oil from spreading further.
            Depressions and imperfections trap oil and debris. The oil follows contours, accentuating surface irregularities.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes oil to flow downwards, resulting in drip marks on vertical surfaces. Oil settles
            on horizontal surfaces, forming pools or puddles. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets of oil. The rate
            of downward flow depends on the viscosity of the oil and the surface tension. The effect is most pronounced on
            vertical and inclined surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen. Aged contamination appears
            more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals variations in color and thickness. Thicker deposits may cast shadows,
            highlighting surface irregularities. The presence of metallic particles (from wear debris) can create a subtle
            metallic sheen in some areas.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slightly tacky. Over time, it becomes waxy or slightly crusty
            due to oxidation and polymerization. Dust and debris adhere readily, creating a rougher surface. Close inspection
            reveals a non-uniform coating with variations in thickness and gloss. The wood grain remains visible but may be
            obscured by heavy buildup. Feels slightly sticky to the touch, even when seemingly dry.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 200 μm - 1 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >1 mm. Varies significantly based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: A barely visible layer of oil. 2) Drip marks: Vertical
            streaks of oil running down surfaces. 3) Pools/puddles: Accumulations of oil in low-lying areas. 4) Thick crusts:
            Hardened deposits of aged oil and debris. 5) Discrete patches: Isolated areas of contamination. 6) Stains: Discoloration
            of the wood surface. 7) Buildups: Accumulations of oil and debris in specific locations.'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface texture, airflow, and oil application. Uniformity is highest on surfaces directly exposed to oil mist,
            but even then, variations in thickness are present. Crevices and edges tend to have higher concentrations.
        porcelain:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light brown in color. Over time, it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter. The texture changes from smooth to sticky to crusty.
            The thickness increases as more oil/grease accumulates. Aged contamination is often black, matte, and may exhibit
            cracking or flaking.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours). It then thickens over time (days) due to continued contamination.
            It often begins at contact points (e.g., drips) and then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and
            move inward, or vice versa depending on the source. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with airborne contamination.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with intermittent contamination,
            creating distinct layers of different colors and textures. Seasonal variations can influence the rate of buildup
            due to temperature and humidity changes.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #8B4513 (SaddleBrown) with a slight sheen. Days old: #654321 (DarkBrown)
            with a matte finish. Weeks old: #4A3020 (DarkCoffee) with localized darkening. Months old: #221E1E (Charcoal)
            with a crusty appearance. Heavily oxidized: #36454F (SmokyGray) with a chalky residue.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low-lying areas,
            and a general accumulation along edges and corners. On horizontal surfaces, a more uniform coating may develop,
            especially if the contamination source is airborne or sprayed. Point source contamination often results in a radial
            spreading pattern.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas
            trap more contamination than exposed areas. Horizontal surfaces generally have a more uniform coating than vertical
            surfaces, but pooling can occur in low spots.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often only detectable by touch. Thickness:
            <1 μm. Light (10-30%): Patchy distribution, slight discoloration. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating, darker color. Thickness: 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, significant buildup. Thickness:
            50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, tar-like layer, obscuring the original surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on porcelain typically presents as a viscous, dark coating, ranging from
            a thin, barely visible sheen to a thick, almost tar-like layer. The color is predominantly dark brown to black,
            often with a slightly glossy or matte finish depending on the age and oxidation level. Coverage patterns vary
            from uniform films to localized accumulations, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually from spraying), edge
            accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (from intermittent contamination), streaky/linear (from
            dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners), radial patterns (around a leak point).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to creep along the edges, forming a thicker bead. This is especially noticeable
            on horizontal surfaces. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, or may be relatively clean
            if the contamination source is primarily edge-focused.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It
            drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a bead. It follows contours, creating
            patterns. It bridges gaps, forming connections between surfaces. It fills depressions, creating puddles.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Drip marks extend from top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical
            streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes, creating gradients. Hangs from
            overhead surfaces, forming drips. The angle of the surface directly influences the flow rate and accumulation
            pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, matte appearance of aged contamination. Iridescence or rainbow effects
            are possible with very thin films of fresh oil, especially if water is present. Heavily oxidized deposits appear
            dull and absorb light.
          texture_details: Fresh oil feels slippery and viscous. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. With further aging
            and oxidation, it transitions to a crusty, sometimes brittle texture. Close inspection may reveal a slightly granular
            or uneven surface due to the presence of particulate matter and oxidation products. The surface can range from
            smooth to rough depending on the thickness and age of the deposit.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of concentrated accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (vertical surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the porcelain), uniform coatings (sprayed
            contamination), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the contamination source, the surface orientation, and
            the cleaning frequency. Airborne contamination tends to be more uniform than direct drips or leaks.
        porphyry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film, often barely visible. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more viscous. It can harden into a crusty residue, often incorporating
            dust and debris, leading to a dull, matte finish. The color shifts from amber to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days). It begins at contact
            points (leaks, spills) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Layering effects
            are common, with new contamination depositing on top of older, hardened layers. Seasonal variations can occur,
            with increased buildup during periods of heavy machinery use or warmer temperatures.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent sheen with a slight amber tint (#D4A373). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a burnt umber (#8A3324) or dark brown (#3D3025). Heavily contaminated areas
            can appear almost black (#000000) or exhibit a dark, reddish-brown hue (#800000) due to iron oxide formation from
            corrosion.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and in crevices. Splatter patterns from machinery are also frequently observed. The buildup often
            starts as localized spots that gradually expand and coalesce.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices where oil accumulates due
            to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination are often heavier than sheltered
            areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks with higher concentrations at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces tend to
            accumulate thicker layers due to settling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, thickness < 0.1 μm. Light (10-30%): slight discoloration,
            thin film, thickness 0.1-1 μm. Moderate (30-60%): noticeable darkening, patchy coverage, thickness 1-10 μm. Heavy
            (60-85%): significant discoloration, thick layer, thickness 10-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): almost complete coverage,
            thick crust, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on porphyry presents as a darkening and discoloration of the stone surface,
            ranging from subtle sheens to thick, crusty deposits. The color is typically dark brown or black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with accumulation
            in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or spills), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (from intermittent contamination), streaky/linear (from dripping or running), localized concentrations (in crevices
            or low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to spread along the perimeter before filling in the center areas. This is especially noticeable
            in porous materials like porphyry.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools
            on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, following contours and bridging small gaps. Depressions
            fill with oil, creating localized reservoirs.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces, forming thicker layers. Runs down slopes
            are observed, with thicker deposits at the bottom. Hanging from overhead surfaces is rare but possible with very
            viscous grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a slight sheen or gloss, reflecting light. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the buildup. Aged contamination typically has a matte finish and
            absorbs light, appearing darker. Iridescence can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: The texture varies significantly. Fresh oil is slick and smooth to the touch. As it ages, it becomes
            sticky and tacky. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty, brittle layer. The surface
            may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss when fresh, transitioning to a matte or even rough texture as it ages and
            accumulates particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (0.1-1 μm) to heavy buildup (0.5-5 mm or more). The thickness
            varies significantly depending on the source and duration of the contamination.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow), pools/puddles
            (in depressions), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the stone), uniform coatings (rare, only with consistent
            exposure), buildups (accumulated layers).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, exposure to the contaminant source, and the effects
            of gravity and weathering.
        praseodymium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, oily film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks to months),
            it darkens to brown and becomes more viscous. Aged contamination (months to years) is a thick, black, crusty layer
            that is difficult to remove. Oxidation products and particulate matter contribute to the darkening and thickening.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens (days). Begins at contact points (leaks, spills)
            then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward due to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is rare; point sources that expand outward are more common. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation. The initial
            thin film can appear within hours, noticeable thickening within days, and significant crusting within months.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent amber, similar to #D4A373 with a slight rainbow sheen'
          - 'Lightly Contaminated: Light brown, resembling raw umber (#826644)'
          - 'Moderately Contaminated: Medium brown with reddish hues, like burnt sienna (#E97451)'
          - 'Heavily Contaminated: Dark brown to almost black, close to dark umber (#563D26) with localized black (#000000)
            deposits from oxidation'
          - 'Aged: Black, matte finish (#000000) with possible green/blue iridescence due to oxidation and chemical reactions'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, edges, and areas of low flow. Initially forms a thin film,
            then builds up in localized spots and streaks. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Flat surfaces tend
            to accumulate a more uniform layer, while edges and corners exhibit thicker deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low points also accumulate more contamination. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from
            top to bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or removal by airflow.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Very thick, crusty buildup with complete coverage. Thickness is typically >500 μm.
              visual: A very thick, black (#000000) crust that completely covers the praseodymium surface, often with drip
                marks and other formations.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Thick, dark coating with significant buildup. Thickness is typically 100-500 μm.
              visual: A thick, dark brown to black (#563D26) coating that obscures most of the praseodymium surface.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Thin film with noticeable discoloration. Thickness is typically 1-10 μm.
              visual: A thin, patchy layer of light brown (#826644) with some areas of bare praseodymium visible.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Visible coating with significant discoloration. Thickness is typically 10-100 μm.
              visual: A more continuous layer of medium brown (#E97451) with some variations in thickness and color.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Barely visible, appearing as isolated spots or a faint sheen. Thickness is typically <1 μm.
              visual: Isolated spots of light brown (#826644) or a faint iridescent sheen.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on praseodymium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, but with age and exposure, it darkens and thickens, forming a sticky, uneven
            layer. The dominant colors range from amber to dark brown, often with localized areas of black.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or spills), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker deposit. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and
            corners. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, filling them completely.
            Pools on flat areas, creating thicker layers. Drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. Collects at edges,
            creating a raised rim. Follows contours, conforming to the surface shape. Bridges gaps, creating a continuous
            layer across discontinuities. Fills depressions, leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is prominent on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low points. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating
            a more uniform layer. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces,
            forming droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Under direct sunlight, iridescent effects may be visible, especially in thin films.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the buildup.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it oxidizes. With heavy buildup, it can
            become crusty and slightly rough. At a microscopic level, the surface may exhibit a granular texture due to the
            presence of particulate contaminants and oxidation products. Feels greasy and difficult to remove.
          thickness_range: From a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily visible and palpable).
            Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in areas of high accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform
            coatings (rare, usually from controlled application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface finish, flow patterns, and contamination sources. The level of uniformity depends on the application
            method and the environmental conditions. Gravity also plays a significant role in creating non-uniformity.
        ptfe:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks to
            months), it darkens to brown or black due to oxidation and thermal degradation. The texture changes from smooth
            to sticky and eventually to a hard, crusty residue. Thickness increases with continued exposure. Aged deposits
            are often mixed with particulate matter, giving them a dull, matte finish.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. Begins at contact points and
            edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; more often, it's point sources that expand outward.
            Layering effects occur with repeated applications or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can
            affect the rate of oxidation and buildup. Months to years for significant crusting.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to golden yellow (#FFD700). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#8B4513) to black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges from oxidation products. Heavily
            oxidized: May exhibit a dull, grayish-brown (#808080) hue.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It often accumulates at edges, in crevices, and around contact
            points. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, it tends to pool and form
            thicker layers. Point source spreading from lubrication points is also frequently observed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas tend to accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal
            surfaces show pooling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film,
            thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with some bare areas, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, continuous coating, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, thickness > 100 μm,
            potentially exceeding 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PTFE typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from a barely
            visible sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies significantly with age and composition, shifting from
            light amber to dark brown or even black. The texture is generally sticky and can accumulate dust and debris, creating
            a matte appearance.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Point source spreading
            (from lubrication points), Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Pooling (on horizontal surfaces), Patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven application or wear), Streaky/linear (from wiping or cleaning attempts), Localized concentrations
            (around seals or bearings).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects. The oil/grease tends to
            migrate towards the perimeter of the PTFE surface. This is especially noticeable on flat surfaces and around the
            edges of seals and bearings. The mechanism is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to capillary action. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps between components. Fills depressions and imperfections
            in the PTFE surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, resulting in thicker layers.
            Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hangs from overhead surfaces in the form of drips or
            stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish due to the
            accumulation of dust and debris. Iridescence or rainbow effects are rare but possible with very thin films of
            fresh oil.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky, attracting dust
            and debris. Aged buildup can be crusty or hardened, especially if exposed to high temperatures. Close inspection
            may reveal a slightly granular or uneven surface due to the presence of solid additives and oxidation products.
            Feels slippery when fresh, but increasingly rough and abrasive as it ages.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more. Varies significantly
            depending on the application and maintenance schedule.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (from fluid flow), Pools/puddles (on horizontal
            surfaces), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (aged buildup), Discrete patches (uneven application),
            Spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), Stains (penetration into PTFE pores, if any), Uniform coatings (rare,
            only with controlled application), Buildups (around seals and bearings).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to factors such
            as gravity, surface tension, and uneven application. It is typically concentrated in specific areas, such as edges,
            crevices, and contact points. The level of uniformity depends on the application method and the operating conditions.
        pvc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a glossy, dark brown or black liquid film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more viscous. It may develop a matte finish and a crusty or hardened
            surface. The color shifts towards black, and cracking or crazing may occur.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., near machinery) and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible on horizontal surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation (months).
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #333333 (dark gray, almost black). Slightly aged: #4F3A2D (dark brown).
            Moderately aged: #654321 (saddle brown). Heavily aged/oxidized: #26231F (very dark, almost black, with a slight
            greenish tinge due to copper corrosion products from additives). Extreme aging: #0A0A0A (black, often with a dry,
            cracked appearance).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and seams. Splatter patterns can also be observed near machinery. A thin, even film may cover large
            areas, especially on horizontal surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges, corners, and crevices tend to have the heaviest
            buildup due to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces of horizontal pipes or ledges may have less
            buildup than the bottom surfaces due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to wind and rain washing
            away the contamination.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin film with some visible accumulation at edges, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with
            visible drip marks and pooling, thickness 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant buildup,
            thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup covering almost the entire surface, thickness
            > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on PVC typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges from
            a thin sheen to a thick, sticky layer. The color is usually dark brown or black, with a slightly glossy or matte
            finish depending on the age and oxidation level. It tends to accumulate in low points and along edges due to gravity
            and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (thin film on horizontal surfaces),
            edge accumulation (along seams and edges), point source spreading (radiating from a leak), gradient from source
            (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (random distribution), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized
            concentrations (in corners and crevices), radial patterns (around rotating equipment). Edge accumulation and drip
            marks are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to flow towards and adhere to the edges, creating a thicker layer compared
            to the center areas. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, follows contours, and bridges gaps. The smaller the crevice, the greater the accumulation due to capillary
            action.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the dark color and any surface irregularities. Heavily oxidized grease tends to have a matte
            finish, reducing reflectivity. Iridescence may be observed in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and tacky. With further aging, it can become crusty, hardened, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can exhibit a slight orange-peel
            texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm (easily
            visible and tangible). Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 5 mm or more in areas of heavy accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled streaks), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (on horizontal surfaces), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (random
            spots), spots/dots (splatter), stains (discoloration of the PVC), uniform coatings (thin layers), buildups (thick
            accumulations). Drip marks and thin films are most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by factors such as airflow, temperature gradients, and the source
            of the contamination. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical surfaces.
        pyrex:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, often barely visible, oily film. Over time, it darkens in color
            due to oxidation and thermal degradation. The texture changes from smooth to sticky and eventually to a hard,
            crusty residue. Thickness increases as more material accumulates and existing material polymerizes.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin, almost invisible film that uniformly coats the surface.
            Over hours and days, it thickens, especially at contact points and edges. After a few weeks, the buildup starts
            to spread from the edges inward. Over months, layering effects become visible as new contamination deposits on
            top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of accumulation
            and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber, close to #F0C808'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Light brown, #A07A49'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown, #6B4F32'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown with blackish edges, #3C2A1A'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned (years): Black, #000000, often with iridescent sheen'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate along edges, in corners, and in any
            surface imperfections. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, it may form pools or
            rings. Areas exposed to higher temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Top surfaces may accumulate more airborne contaminants. Bottom surfaces and crevices collect drips and pooled
            liquids. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks with heavier concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate
            more material than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning or evaporation.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, opaque layer with dark color and crusty texture. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Almost complete coverage, heavy buildup, significant alteration of the original surface appearance.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, opaque layer with significant color. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Most of the surface covered, significant discoloration and texture change.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, translucent film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Patchy coverage, slight darkening of the surface.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Opaque film with noticeable color. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Visible buildup, some areas still relatively clean.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible film, often only detectable by touch or under specific lighting. Thickness: <5
                μm.'
              visual_appearance: Slight sheen, faint discoloration.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Pyrex typically appears as a translucent to opaque film, ranging in
            color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and even crusty
            as it ages, often accumulating more heavily in areas of lower surface energy or where gravity pulls the liquid.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven deposition), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners),
            and drip marks (on vertical surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The liquid tends to spread along the perimeter, creating a thicker layer at the boundaries.
            This is often more pronounced than concentration in the center, unless there is a direct source of contamination
            in the center area.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges
            act as barriers, collecting material. Contours guide flow patterns. Depressions fill with liquid. Gaps can be
            bridged by viscous grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Slopes direct flow. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting can
            reveal subtle color variations and thickness gradients. Aged, oxidized buildup tends to have a matte finish. In
            some cases, particularly with very thin films, iridescence or rainbow effects may be visible due to thin-film
            interference.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup is oily and smooth to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With prolonged exposure to heat, it can harden into a crusty, sometimes brittle, layer. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can range from glossy to matte depending
            on the degree of oxidation and the presence of dust or other contaminants.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on the application and exposure time. Thin films can be
            as thin as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges from 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup can exceed 1 mm, especially in areas
            of accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from liquid flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged and oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (uneven deposition), spots/dots (splatter or condensation), stains (penetration into surface
            imperfections), and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, temperature gradients, airflow
            patterns, and the nature of the contamination source (e.g., a leak vs. general airborne deposition).
        quartz glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light
            amber color. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more opaque. The
            texture changes from oily to sticky to crusty. Oxidation and polymerization contribute to the hardening and darkening
            of the deposit.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours). It thickens over time (days/weeks) due to continued
            deposition. It often begins at contact points (e.g., where oil drips) and then spreads outward. Buildup can start
            at edges and move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with oil mist. Point sources expand outward.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation (months).
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost clear with a slight yellow tint (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-brown (#A07A44), translucent'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#8B4513), becoming more opaque'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301900), opaque with reddish undertones'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Burnt sienna (#E97451) with black speckles'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include streaks from dripping, pooling in low spots, and accumulation along edges
            and corners due to surface tension. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading. A thin, even
            film can also occur, especially with airborne oil mist.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension. Top surfaces
            may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Crevices and low spots accumulate more oil. Vertical
            walls exhibit drip marks. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or wiping. Sheltered areas accumulate
            more oil. A gradient pattern typically exists, with the highest concentration near the source of contamination.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Very thick, crusty coating with significant accumulation. Thickness > 100 μm, potentially reaching
                1 mm or more.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Thick, dark brown or black coating with significant buildup. Thickness 25-100 μm.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Thin, translucent film with some visible streaks and spots. Thickness 1-5 μm.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Opaque film with visible buildup at edges and corners. Thickness 5-25 μm.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated droplets or thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness < 1 μm.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on quartz glass typically appears as a translucent to opaque film, ranging
            in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture can vary from smooth and oily to sticky and crusty, depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often non-uniform, with accumulation at edges
            and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (from uneven deposition), streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners),
            and uniform coating (from oil mist). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil tends to migrate towards the edges to minimize its surface energy. While a uniform coating can
            occur, edge accumulation is more common. The center areas may have a thinner film compared to the edges.
          geometry_effects: Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas. It drips
            on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges. It follows contours. It can bridge small gaps. It fills depressions.
            These effects are due to the interplay of surface tension, gravity, and the viscosity of the oil.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal surfaces. It runs down slopes. It can hang from
            overhead surfaces as droplets before dripping. The rate of downward flow depends on the viscosity of the oil and
            the surface tension of the quartz glass.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films can exhibit a slight sheen or iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the yellow/brown tones. Thicker, aged deposits appear matte and absorb light. The
            presence of metallic particles (from wear debris) can create a slight metallic sheen in some areas.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup feels oily and smooth. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. With further aging
            and oxidation, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or amorphous structure. The surface can range from glossy to matte depending on the thickness and oxidation level.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Thin films can be less than 1 μm. Moderate buildup ranges from
            5-50 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 100 μm to 1 mm or more, especially in areas of accumulation.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from liquid flow), pools/puddles
            (in low spots), thin films (uniform coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized contamination),
            spots/dots (small droplets), stains (discoloration of the glass), uniform coatings (from oil mist), and buildups
            (at edges and corners). Drip marks and thin films are very common.
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible with oil mist. Moderately patchy is common. Highly variable/irregular is typical with leaks and drips.
            Concentration is often highest near the source of contamination or in areas where oil pools. The uniformity level
            is primarily determined by the method of contamination and the surface properties of the quartz glass.
        quartzite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light
            amber color. Aged contamination (months/years) darkens significantly, becoming thicker, more opaque, and often
            developing a crusty or hardened surface. The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks, and the texture becomes
            less oily and more solid.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), often at contact points or near leaks. It then spreads
            outwards (days), thickening over time. Accumulation often begins at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is less common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, #F0C808, almost transparent.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown, #A07A3D, with a slight sheen.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown, #6B4F1E, matte finish.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black, #301E00, often with a crusty appearance.'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Reddish-brown, #8B4513, resembling burnt sienna, especially near heat sources.'
          common_patterns: The buildup often starts as localized spots or streaks, especially near lubrication points or leaks.
            It tends to accumulate in crevices, along edges, and in any surface imperfections. Over time, these spots can
            coalesce into larger patches or a more uniform coating. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Crevices and low-lying areas also accumulate more oil/grease. Vertical walls often show drip marks with
            higher concentration at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer. Sheltered areas
            may have thicker deposits due to less exposure to cleaning or weathering.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Almost complete coverage, thick crust or layer of oil/grease. Thickness: >200 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Almost complete coverage, thick crust or layer of oil/grease, significantly altering the
                surface appearance.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Significant discoloration, thick coating in many areas. Thickness: 50-200 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Significant discoloration, thick coating in many areas, obscuring the original surface.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Scattered spots and streaks, noticeable discoloration. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Noticeable but thin film, scattered spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Patches of discoloration, some areas with thicker buildup. Thickness: 25-50 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Visible patches and streaks, some areas with thicker buildup.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Barely perceptible discoloration, isolated droplets.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on quartzite typically presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte,
            coating. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on age and composition. Coverage can vary
            from sparse spotting to a thick, nearly opaque layer, often concentrated in crevices and low-lying areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (along corners and edges), point
            source spreading (radiating outwards from a leak), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance
            from the source), patchy/spotty (irregularly distributed spots), streaky/linear (following flow paths), localized
            concentrations (in crevices or low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and surface
            tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated line. This is especially
            noticeable at corners and along the perimeter of the quartzite surface.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices and low spots,
            filling depressions. On vertical surfaces, it drips downwards. It collects at edges due to capillary action. It
            follows contours of the surface. These effects are driven by the fluid dynamics of the oil/grease and the surface
            properties of the quartzite.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom.
            Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging
            from overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the discoloration and texture differences. Heavily aged deposits often have a matte
            finish, while areas with thicker, fresher oil may still show some gloss. Iridescence is rare but possible with
            very thin films.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels oily and slippery. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. Heavily aged
            deposits can be hard, crusty, and even slightly crystalline due to oxidation and polymerization. The surface can
            range from smooth to rough depending on the thickness and age of the deposit. Microscopic examination may reveal
            a layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Thin films can be as little as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 0.5-2 mm or even thicker in extreme cases, resembling a thin crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (following gravity),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches
            (isolated spots), stains (penetrated into the quartzite surface), uniform coatings (less common, but possible),
            buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the source of the contamination, the surface geometry,
            and the cleaning history. Areas near the source are usually more heavily contaminated than areas further away.
        redwood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface may develop a matte finish or a cracked,
            crazed appearance due to oxidation and shrinkage. Very old deposits can become hard and brittle, flaking off the
            surface. The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film, typically within hours of exposure. It then thickens over
            days and weeks, especially at contact points and edges. The oil spreads from these initial points, gradually covering
            more of the surface. Over months and years, the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, forming a thicker, darker, and more
            hardened layer. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and the viscosity
            of the oil.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, similar to raw honey (#F0C808) with a slight green tint from copper corrosion inhibitors
            (if present).'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Darker amber, approaching a burnt sienna (#E97451).'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish undertones, like reddish-brown leather (#A0522D).'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black, often with a hint of green or blue iridescence due to oxidation and
            metallic additives (#301919).'
          - 'Extreme Buildup: Black, opaque, with possible greyish-white deposits from calcium sulfonate soap formation (#000000).'
          common_patterns: Oil/grease tends to accumulate in crevices, along edges, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity.
            Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks near the source of the leak or spill. Over time,
            these spots spread and coalesce, forming a more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces. Drip marks
            are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity
            and capillary action. Edges and corners also tend to accumulate more oil/grease. Top surfaces of horizontal members
            will have less accumulation than the bottom surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more than exposed areas due to
            reduced weathering.

            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Thick, opaque crust, completely obscuring the wood surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              visual: Black, opaque, crusty or hardened surface, no visible wood grain.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Dark brown to black coating, thick and viscous. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual: Dark brown to black, wood grain largely obscured, glossy or matte finish.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Noticeable staining, thin film covering some areas. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual: Light amber to light brown discoloration, wood grain still clearly visible.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant discoloration, thicker film covering most areas. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual: Medium brown discoloration, wood grain partially obscured.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible discoloration. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual: Scattered light amber spots, minimal change in wood appearance.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on redwood presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to a thick, viscous coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown/black
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. The texture varies from a slightly tacky film to a
            hardened, crusty layer.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to splashing
            or dripping), streaky/linear (caused by runoff), localized concentrations (accumulation in crevices), and uniform
            coating (on horizontal surfaces). Point source spreading and streaky/linear patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to
            surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to
            the center areas. This is especially noticeable on horizontal surfaces and around fasteners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating runs and streaks. It collects at edges,
            forming a bead-like buildup. It follows contours, conforming to the shape of the surface. It bridges gaps and
            fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior,
            pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, and settling on horizontal surfaces.
            The angle of the surface directly affects the rate of flow and the thickness of the deposit. Drip marks can extend
            several centimeters or even meters down vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and oxidizes, the
            gloss diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. In indoor fluorescent lighting, the color appears less vibrant
            and more muted. Heavily contaminated areas may exhibit a slight iridescence or rainbow effect due to thin-film
            interference, especially if water is present.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and slippery to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and polymerizes,
            it becomes sticky and tacky. Over time, it can harden into a crusty, brittle layer. The redwood grain may still
            be visible through thinner layers, but thicker deposits obscure the wood's natural texture. Expect a slight tackiness
            even in aged samples due to unreacted hydrocarbons.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on the source and duration of the contamination. Thin
            films can be as thin as 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup ranges from 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup can exceed 1 mm, forming
            a visible crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (caused by runoff),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (splashes or spills), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into the wood), and buildups (accumulation
            in corners and crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The uniformity level is influenced by the source of contamination, the surface orientation,
            and environmental factors (e.g., wind, rain). Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than vertical
            surfaces.
        rhenium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, oily film, often barely visible. Over time, it darkens and
            thickens due to oxidation, polymerization, and the accumulation of particulate matter. The surface becomes rougher
            and more matte. Very old deposits can become hard and brittle, sometimes flaking off.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye, within hours of exposure.
            Over days, it thickens and darkens, becoming more visible. Buildup often begins at contact points or edges and
            then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point source expansion. Layering
            effects can occur with intermittent lubrication or cleaning cycles. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#F0C808) with a slight sheen.'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Light brown (#A07A4A) with a matte finish.'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges.'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to black (#301900) with a crusty texture.'
          - 'Extremely Aged (years): Black (#000000) with potential iridescent sheen due to oxidation and thermal degradation.'
          common_patterns: The buildup often starts at points of contact or areas with restricted airflow. It tends to accumulate
            in crevices, corners, and along edges. On flat surfaces, it can form a more uniform coating, but often with variations
            in thickness. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low points also accumulate more oil/grease. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, leading to
            higher concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas often have thicker deposits than exposed areas due to reduced
            evaporation and cleaning.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              typical_thickness: '>250 μm'
              visual_appearance: Very thick, black, and crusty layer completely covering the metal surface. Significant buildup
                and potential flaking.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              typical_thickness: 50-250 μm
              visual_appearance: Thick, dark coating that obscures most of the underlying metal. Crusty texture may be present.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              typical_thickness: 5-15 μm
              visual_appearance: Thin, translucent coating with some visible areas of bare metal. Slight discoloration.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              typical_thickness: 15-50 μm
              visual_appearance: Noticeable brown or black coating, but the underlying metal is still partially visible. Matte
                finish.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              typical_thickness: 1-5 μm
              visual_appearance: Barely visible film, isolated spots or streaks. Appears mostly clean.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Rhenium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is initially a translucent amber, darkening
            to a deep brown or black with age and oxidation. Coverage varies significantly depending on the operating environment
            and maintenance schedule.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), point source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or localized leaks), streaky/linear (drip marks or flow patterns), localized
            concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. Crevices act as traps, leading to buildup. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote
            dripping. Edges concentrate the contaminant. Depressions fill with oil/grease. Sharp edges can create shadowing
            effects, leading to uneven distribution.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in drip marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common.
            Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Hanging formations can occur on overhead
            surfaces, but are less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            more matte, the sheen diminishes. In indoor fluorescent lighting, the darker deposits appear almost black. Iridescence
            can occur in heavily oxidized areas due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and viscous. As it ages, it becomes
            increasingly rough, crusty, and potentially hard. Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous mixture of amorphous
            hydrocarbons and crystalline deposits of ZDDP and calcium sulfonates. It feels tacky to the touch, even when seemingly
            dry.
          thickness_range: 'Thickness varies significantly. Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup:
            0.5-2 mm or more. Extreme cases can reach several millimeters, resembling a thick crust.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (localized leaks), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare,
            controlled application), buildups (accumulations in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, operating conditions, and the
            geometry of the Rhenium surface. Areas with high shear or temperature gradients tend to have less uniform buildup.
        rhodium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, translucent amber film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) darkens to a thick, opaque black or dark brown crust. The texture changes from oily to sticky to
            hard and brittle. Thickness increases significantly over time, and the surface becomes rougher due to oxidation
            and particulate accumulation.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours), then thickens
            and becomes more visible (days). It often begins at contact points or lubrication points and then spreads outward
            (days/weeks). Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; point sources
            that expand outward are more common. Layering effects occur as new oil is deposited on top of older, oxidized
            layers (weeks/months). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup
            (months).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C27B) with slight iridescence. Initial oxidation: Yellowish-brown
            (#A0785A). Moderate buildup: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish undertones. Aged/Heavily Oxidized: Black (#000000)
            with possible greyish patches (#808080) due to particulate matter accumulation. High-temperature degradation:
            Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform thin films, localized spots around lubrication points, streaks
            from dripping or flow, and accumulations in crevices and low-lying areas. Edges and corners often exhibit heavier
            buildup due to surface tension effects. Heat exposure can lead to a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low points act as collection
            areas. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform coating, but thickness can vary. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks
            and streaks. Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust and debris, leading to thicker, darker deposits.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film with slight iridescence. Thickness: 1-5 μm.
            Light (10-30%): Patchy film with visible amber color. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coating
            with darker brown color. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating with dark brown or black
            color. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, tar-like deposit with black color and crusty texture.
            Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on rhodium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color is initially a light amber, darkening to
            shades of brown and black with age and exposure to heat and oxidation. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films
            to localized accumulations in crevices and low points.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with specific application
            methods), edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized
            contamination), streaky/linear (due to dripping or flow), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil tends to creep along the surface and collect at the perimeter. This is especially noticeable
            on flat surfaces and around the edges of components. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform film, while
            the edges exhibit a thicker, more concentrated buildup.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them over time. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker
            deposits. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, creating a raised rim. It follows
            contours, creating uneven thickness. It bridges gaps, forming solid connections between surfaces. It fills depressions,
            creating smooth, filled areas.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low points. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker deposits. Runs occur down slopes. Oil hangs from overhead
            surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit iridescence and a slight sheen. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the darker colors and textures more clearly. Aged buildup tends to have a matte finish due to
            oxidation and surface roughness. Thicker deposits may exhibit a slight gloss, especially when freshly applied.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, it
            becomes sticky and viscous. With further aging, it can harden into a crusty or tar-like consistency. Particulate
            matter can create a gritty surface. At high temperatures, it can become a brittle, cracked solid.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5
            mm) for heavy buildup. A typical moderate coating is between 25-250 μm thick. Extreme buildup can exceed 5 mm
            in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (in low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform
            coatings (rare, controlled application), buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies significantly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform with
            minor variations is possible with controlled application. Moderately patchy is common in most industrial settings.
            Highly variable/irregular is typical with uncontrolled contamination. Concentration is often higher near lubrication
            points or in areas with poor ventilation.
        rosewood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (weeks to months), the oil oxidizes
            and polymerizes, darkening in color and becoming more viscous. Dust and debris accumulate, creating a matte, grimy
            surface. Very old buildup (years) can harden into a brittle, crusty layer that is difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. It then thickens over time,
            becoming more visible and tacky. It begins at contact points (e.g., around fasteners) and spreads outward. It
            also starts at edges and moves inward due to capillary action. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs in areas of
            constant exposure. Point sources expand outward in radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations may be observed, with increased buildup during periods of higher usage or leakage.
            Timeframe: Hours (initial film), Days (visible discoloration), Weeks (tacky surface), Months (thick buildup),
            Years (crusty layer).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, close to #F5DEB3 (wheat)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown, #A07A44 (umber)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown with reddish undertones, #8B4513 (saddle brown)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Very dark brown, almost black, #221E1F (ebony)'
          - 'Oxidized: May exhibit a slight greenish or bluish iridescent sheen in thicker areas, due to light interference
            within the oil film.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in horizontal crevices, and accumulates
            along edges and corners. Point sources of contamination, such as leaking fittings, result in radial patterns spreading
            outward. Areas subject to frequent handling exhibit more uniform coverage.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            gravity. Top surfaces exposed to dripping contamination are heavier than bottom surfaces. Corners accumulate more
            than flat surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more than exposed areas (less washing away by rain or cleaning).

          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on rosewood presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from a subtle sheen to a thick, tacky coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown, often
            with a slightly iridescent or rainbow-like sheen in areas with thicker deposits. Buildup tends to concentrate
            in crevices, along edges, and in areas of frequent contact.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (areas of frequent contact), edge
            accumulation (capillary action), point source spreading (leaks), gradient from source (decreasing concentration
            with distance), patchy/spotty (splatters), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (crevices), and
            radial patterns (around leaks).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners due to
            capillary action and surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along edges, creating a darker outline. Center
            areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially if subject to wiping or contact.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, forming puddles. It
            drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due to capillary action. It follows contours,
            creating visible patterns. It bridges gaps, forming continuous films.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs
            occur down slopes. Oil/grease hangs from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. Thicker deposits may show iridescence.
            Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the surface appears duller, with less pronounced sheen. Aged, dust-covered
            buildup has a matte finish.
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup feels slick and oily. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes tacky and sticky.
            Heavy buildup can form a crusty or gummy layer. The rosewood grain may still be visible through thinner layers,
            but thicker deposits obscure the wood's natural texture. Dust and particulate matter often adhere to the sticky
            surface, creating a rougher texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a monomolecular film (< 1 μm) to heavy buildup exceeding 1 mm. Typical thin
            films are in the 5-25 μm range. Moderate buildup is 50-200 μm. Heavy buildup can reach 0.5-1 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (wiped areas), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (splatters),
            spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated into the wood), uniform coatings (frequent contact), and buildups
            (corners, crevices).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Areas subject to wiping or frequent contact tend to have more
            uniform coverage. Crevices and corners exhibit highly variable/irregular concentrations. Splatters result in a
            moderately patchy distribution. Overall, the distribution is rarely perfectly uniform.
        rubber:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often barely noticeable. Over time, it darkens
            and thickens, becoming more visible and pronounced. The texture changes from smooth to sticky to crusty. Aged
            deposits are often harder to remove and may exhibit cracking or flaking. Color shifts from translucent brown to
            opaque black.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens and darkens over days/weeks. It often
            begins at contact points or edges and spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible on protected surfaces.
            Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of oxidation and accumulation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: #704214 (Saddle Brown) - a translucent, oily sheen. Days/Weeks: #4A300B (Dark Brown) -
            darkening due to oxidation and particulate accumulation. Months: #21180A (Very Dark Brown/Black) - opaque, matte
            finish. Years: #0A0A0A (Black) - hardened, potentially cracked surface. Heavily Oxidized: #5E4221 (Olive Brown)
            - due to surface oxidation and exposure to UV light.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, starting at points of contact or areas where oil is introduced.
            It tends to spread outward from these points, forming streaks or drip marks on vertical surfaces. Crevices and
            low points act as collection areas, leading to thicker deposits. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            coating, while edges may exhibit a buildup due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom areas on vertical surfaces accumulate more oil due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas also tend to have higher concentrations. Flat horizontal surfaces can have relatively uniform concentrations,
            but may exhibit pooling in low spots.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable sheen,
            slight discoloration, 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct layer, darker color, 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick,
            visible buildup, significant discoloration, 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Extensive coverage, thick crust, >500
            μm, potentially dripping.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on rubber presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges from
            a thin sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color is typically dark brown to black, with variations depending on
            the oil type, age, and environmental conditions. The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky
            and crusty when aged, often accumulating in crevices and low points.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution), streaky/linear (due to flow
            or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (on flat, undisturbed surfaces). The most
            common pattern is a combination of point source spreading and localized concentrations.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the center of a flat surface. This effect
            is less pronounced on rough or porous rubber surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, and collects at edges. It follows contours and bridges small
            gaps. Depressions fill with oil, leading to thicker deposits in those areas. Sharp edges may exhibit a buildup
            due to surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in
            drip marks and vertical streaking. Oil pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes,
            creating angled streaks. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or thin films.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a more matte finish, especially with aged deposits. The color appears darker under low light
            conditions. Iridescence is generally absent unless the oil film is extremely thin (interference effects).
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky within days. Over weeks, it transitions to
            a viscous, slightly rough texture due to the accumulation of dirt and debris. Aged buildup can be crusty, hardened,
            and even slightly cracked, with a surface that feels rough and uneven. Some formulations may exhibit a slight
            tackiness even when aged. Grain is generally absent unless particulate matter is embedded.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm (barely visible). Light buildup: 10-50 μm (noticeable sheen). Moderate buildup:
            50-200 μm (distinct layer). Heavy buildup: 200 μm - 1 mm (thick, crusty layer). Extreme buildup: >1 mm (significant
            accumulation).'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow patterns),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the rubber), and uniform coatings (on
            protected surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare, occurring only on perfectly flat, undisturbed surfaces with consistent oil exposure. Variations
            are caused by surface irregularities, gravity, airflow, and the method of oil introduction.
        ruthenium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Over time (days to
            weeks), it darkens to a brown color and thickens. After months or years, it becomes a dark brown or black, hardened
            crust, often with a matte finish. Oxidation and thermal degradation can lead to the formation of a brittle, cracked
            surface.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days). It often
            begins at contact points or edges and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible, but less
            common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation (months).
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F0C808) with iridescent sheen'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#A07A44)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#6B4F4F)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3B331C) with black edges'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Black (#000000) with possible reddish-brown (#800000) undertones'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, particularly on vertical surfaces.
            It accumulates preferentially in crevices, corners, and around edges. On horizontal surfaces, it can form pools
            or puddles. The distribution is often uneven, with thicker deposits in areas of higher exposure or lower drainage.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Bottom surfaces and areas with poor drainage also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical
            walls show a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas may have lower concentrations due to wiping
            or cleaning.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete coverage with very thick, hardened deposits. Thickness: >250 μm.'
              visual: A black, crusty layer completely covering the Ruthenium surface.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Significant coating with thick deposits. Thickness: 100-250 μm.'
              visual: A thick, dark brown coating that obscures much of the Ruthenium surface.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with some visible streaks and spots. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual: A faint amber haze with visible streaks and droplets.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Partial coating with visible buildup in crevices and edges. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual: A patchy brown coating with darker areas in corners and along edges.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual: Scattered light amber spots on the Ruthenium surface.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Ruthenium typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that ranges
            in color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly iridescent sheen in thinner layers. The texture varies
            from smooth and oily when fresh to tacky and hardened with age, accumulating preferentially in crevices and low-lying
            areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (flow patterns), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial
            patterns (around a central point). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat center areas. This effect
            is particularly pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at edges,
            follows contours, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to concentrate the buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow behavior, pooling at bottom edges, drip
            marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, and settling on horizontal surfaces. The rate of downward flow depends
            on the viscosity of the oil/grease and the surface tension of the Ruthenium.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen and may show iridescent rainbow
            effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker brown tones.
            Aged deposits have a more matte finish and reflect less light. The color appears more saturated under direct light.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup is smooth, oily, and slippery to the touch. As it ages, it becomes tacky and sticky,
            eventually hardening into a crusty or gummy consistency. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly granular
            or amorphous structure, especially with aged and oxidized deposits. The surface can be smooth or slightly rippled
            depending on the flow and drying patterns.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on the application and exposure. Thin films can be as
            thin as 1-5 μm, while heavy buildup can reach thicknesses of 0.1-1 mm or more. Typical thicknesses range from
            25-250 μm.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into surface
            pores), and buildups (at edges and corners).
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, gravity, surface geometry, and localized sources of contamination.
            The presence of crevices and edges significantly disrupts uniformity.
        sandstone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            becomes thicker, darker, and more matte. Oxidation and polymerization cause the oil to harden and become more
            difficult to remove. The surface may develop a crusty or cracked appearance. The color shifts from yellow/brown
            to dark brown/black.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film at contact points (e.g., leak sources, edges) within hours. Over
            days, it spreads outward from these points, thickening gradually. Edges tend to darken faster than center areas.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is rare; instead, point sources expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated
            contamination events. Seasonal variations (temperature, rain) can affect the rate of buildup and weathering. Months
            to years are required for heavy crust formation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#FDD017) with a slight green tint due to ZDDP'
          - 'Slightly Aged (1-7 days): Yellow-Brown (#A07A49), more matte'
          - 'Moderately Aged (1-6 months): Medium Brown (#8B4513), with darkening around edges'
          - 'Heavily Aged (6+ months): Dark Brown to Black (#301900), often with reddish-brown oxidation products (#B7410E)
            near the surface'
          - 'Extreme Buildup (years): Mottled Black/Brown with possible greyish-white calcium sulfonate deposits'
          common_patterns: Oil/grease tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges due to gravity and
            surface tension. Initial contamination often appears as localized spots or streaks emanating from a source. Over
            time, these spots coalesce, forming larger, irregular patches. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces often exhibit higher concentrations due to downward flow.
            Horizontal surfaces may have pooled oil. Exposed areas may have slightly lower concentrations due to weathering
            and runoff.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Complete saturation with a thick, crusty buildup. Thickness: >200 μm'
              visual: Black, glossy or matte crust covering the sandstone surface.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Extensive coverage with a thick, dark coating. Thickness: 50-200 μm'
              visual: Dark brown to black coating, sandstone grain largely obscured.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Partial coverage with visible staining. Thickness: 5-25 μm'
              visual: Light brown staining with some areas of clean sandstone still visible.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant staining with a noticeable darkening of the surface. Thickness: 25-50 μm'
              visual: Medium brown discoloration, sandstone grain partially obscured.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or droplets, barely noticeable discoloration. Thickness: <5 μm'
              visual: Scattered light amber spots on the sandstone surface.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on sandstone presents as a darkening and staining of the porous surface.
            The initial appearance is often a wet-looking sheen that gradually transitions to a matte, discolored coating.
            Coverage ranges from sparse spotting to complete surface saturation, with color varying from light amber to dark
            brown depending on age and composition.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            Edge accumulation (concentration along edges and corners), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with
            distance), Patchy/spotty (irregular distribution due to uneven application or splashing), Streaky/linear (drip
            marks on vertical surfaces), Localized concentrations (pooling in low spots). Edge accumulation and point source
            spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges of the sandstone blocks or features, creating a darker
            outline. While the center areas may also be contaminated, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices,
            filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, forming puddles or thick films. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a dark line. It follows contours, highlighting surface irregularities.
            It fills depressions, leveling the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and
            runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil runs down slopes.
            Overhanging surfaces may have oil hanging in droplets before dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the discoloration
            and contrast between clean and contaminated areas. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films due to
            interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface feels slick and oily. As the oil ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky and
            tacky. With heavy buildup, a crusty or gummy texture develops. Sandstone's inherent roughness is partially obscured,
            but the grain remains visible through thinner layers. Aged deposits can become hard and brittle, sometimes flaking
            off.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. Thin films can be as thin as 1-5 μm, barely visible. Moderate buildup
            ranges from 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup can reach thicknesses of 0.5-2 mm or more, forming a noticeable crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (vertical streaks), Runs/streaks (irregular flow patterns),
            Pools/puddles (accumulation in low spots), Thin films (initial contamination), Thick crusts (heavy buildup over
            time), Discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), Spots/dots (small droplets or splatters), Stains (penetration
            into the sandstone pores).'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the sandstone was deliberately coated. Variations are caused by uneven application,
            gravity, surface irregularities, and the porous nature of the sandstone, which allows oil to penetrate at different
            rates.
        sapphire glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) is thicker, darker, and more opaque. It often exhibits a hardened, crusty texture
            and may contain embedded particulate matter. The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks due to oxidation
            and thermal degradation.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or edges. It then
            spreads outward, thickening over time. The progression can also begin with point sources (e.g., drips) that expand
            radially. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can influence the rate of oxidation and polymerization, affecting the buildup rate. This process can take hours
            for a thin film to form, days for noticeable accumulation, and months for significant crusting.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber (#F0C808) or pale yellow (#FFFFE0) film. As
            it ages and oxidizes, it transitions to a deeper amber (#D4A00D), then to a burnt orange (#B7410E), and eventually
            to a dark brown or black (#000000) with prolonged exposure and heat. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown
            tint (#808000).
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping
            or splashing, and accumulation along edges and in corners due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat surfaces
            tend to accumulate a more even layer, while vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in corners due to surface tension. Top
            surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Crevices and low
            points act as collection sites, leading to localized buildup. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom
            due to gravity-induced flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, isolated spots, thickness <1 μm. Light (10-30%):
            thin, translucent film, scattered droplets, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): patchy coverage, visible streaks
            and spots, thickness 5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): significant buildup, opaque coating, thickness 25-100 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): thick, crusty layer, obscuring the sapphire surface, thickness >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on sapphire glass typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a barely visible sheen to a thick, dark residue. The color varies depending on the age and composition of
            the contaminant, with a tendency to accumulate at edges and in crevices. The texture ranges from smooth and oily
            to sticky and crusty.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (from inconsistent application or splashing), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (in
            crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most frequently observed.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The liquid tends to spread along the perimeter of the sapphire glass before covering the central
            area. This effect is more pronounced on clean surfaces with high surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. The contaminant accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical
            surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a visible line. It follows contours, conforming to the
            shape of the surface. It bridges gaps if the gap is small enough for surface tension to overcome gravity.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. The contaminant
            hangs from overhead surfaces as droplets until they detach due to their weight.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or oily iridescence. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface texture. Aged contamination often has
            a matte finish due to the hardened surface. Thicker deposits may cast shadows, emphasizing their three-dimensional
            structure.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination feels oily and smooth to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky
            due to oxidation and polymerization. With further aging and exposure to heat, it can harden into a crusty or gummy
            residue. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure. The surface can be smooth or slightly
            rough depending on the thickness and age of the deposit.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies greatly depending on the application and exposure. Thin films can be less than
            1 μm, barely detectable. Moderate buildup ranges from 5-50 μm. Heavy buildup can exceed 100 μm, and in extreme
            cases, reach several millimeters (1-5 mm) in areas of pooling or accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            pools/puddles (in low points), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, hardened deposits), discrete
            patches (splashes or localized contamination), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (discoloration of the sapphire
            surface), uniform coatings (rare, but possible with controlled application), buildups (accumulations in specific
            areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, airflow patterns, gravitational
            forces, and the method of contamination (e.g., splashing vs. dripping).
        scandium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film, easily wiped away. Over time (weeks to
            months), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more difficult to remove. Aged deposits often exhibit a hardened, crusty
            surface with a matte finish, and may crack or flake off.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours). Begins at contact points and spreads outward
            (days). Accumulates at edges and in crevices (days-weeks). Thickens gradually over time (weeks-months). Point
            sources expand outward, forming larger patches (weeks-months). Layering effects occur with repeated contamination
            (months-years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0D587) to light brown (#A67B5B). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to almost black (#222222) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) tinges if iron particles are present
            from wear. Heavily oxidized areas may exhibit a greenish-black sheen (#36454F).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks along moving parts, drip marks on vertical surfaces,
            and accumulation in crevices and corners. Flat surfaces tend to collect a more uniform coating, while edges and
            high points may experience more rapid oxidation and hardening.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier near lubrication points, in crevices and corners, and
            on horizontal surfaces where gravity causes pooling. Vertical walls may exhibit drip marks with thinner coatings.
            Exposed areas may have less buildup due to washing or abrasion, while sheltered areas accumulate more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Patchy, translucent
            coating, 5-20 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable brownish coating, 20-50 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Thick,
            dark brown coating, 50-200 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty, almost black coating, >200 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Scandium typically presents as a viscous, brownish coating that can
            range from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is initially light brown, darkening
            with age and exposure to heat and oxygen. Coverage patterns vary depending on the application and environment,
            but often concentrate in areas of high friction or poor ventilation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (along moving parts), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (on flat surfaces).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Edges also tend to experience more rapid oxidation due to increased exposure to air. Center areas may have more
            uniform but thinner coatings, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of
            the surface. Fills depressions and low spots.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes.
            Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy or wet sheen under direct lighting. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Under fluorescent lighting, the color may appear slightly cooler and more gray.
            Iridescence is possible in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Aged: Becomes sticky, tacky, and eventually hardens
            into a crusty or gummy texture. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure. Can feel
            rough if significant particulate matter is embedded.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters in heavily contaminated areas.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (along moving parts), pools/puddles (in low-lying
            areas), thin films (on lightly contaminated surfaces), thick crusts (in heavily contaminated areas), discrete
            patches (from localized spills), spots/dots (from airborne contaminants), stains (from prolonged contact), and
            uniform coatings (on flat surfaces).
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible on flat, evenly lubricated surfaces. Moderately patchy is common in areas with uneven wear or lubrication.
            Highly variable/irregular is typical in harsh environments with inconsistent contamination.
        schist:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light amber, glossy film. Over time (days/weeks), it darkens to
            a dark amber or brown color due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. The texture becomes tackier
            and more viscous. After months/years, the buildup can harden into a crusty, dark brown or black deposit, often
            exceeding several millimeters in thickness.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or leak sources.
            It then spreads outward, thickening over time. Edges tend to accumulate oil/grease faster than the center areas.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #D4A373 (Light Amber), Aged contamination: #804A00 (Dark Amber), Heavily
            oxidized: #463628 (Dark Brown), With metal particles: #363636 (Dark Grey), After heat exposure: #221F1F (Black)'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low-lying areas, a thin film coating on
            flat surfaces, and localized spots around points of leakage or application. Accumulation is often more pronounced
            along edges and in areas with rougher surface textures.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks with higher concentration at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces
            accumulate thicker layers due to settling. Sheltered areas may have higher concentrations due to reduced weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Patchy film with some visible color change, thickness 5-20 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating
            with distinct color and texture, thickness 20-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous layer with significant
            buildup, thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty deposit obscuring the underlying surface, thickness
            > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on schist typically presents as a dark, glossy or matte coating, ranging
            in color from amber to dark brown or black. The texture varies from a thin, oily film to a thick, crusty deposit,
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often uneven, with accumulation
            in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Point source spreading
            (from leaks), Gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), Patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or localized contamination), Streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band.
            This effect is particularly noticeable on rough or porous surfaces like schist.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, following contours and bridging small gaps.
            Depressions fill with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers. Runs
            down slopes are observed, with the rate depending on viscosity and slope angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals
            a more matte finish. Heavily oxidized deposits may appear dull and non-reflective. Iridescence can sometimes be
            observed in thin films due to interference effects, especially with certain additives.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, smooth, slightly sticky. Aged: Tacky, rough, sometimes crusty. Heavily oxidized:
            Hard, brittle, potentially powdery. With ZDDP degradation: May exhibit a fine, crystalline structure under magnification.
            Feels slick initially, becoming increasingly gritty with age due to particulate accumulation.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm, Light coating: 10-50 μm, Moderate buildup: 50-200 μm, Heavy buildup: 200 μm
            - 2 mm, Extreme buildup: >2 mm'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), Runs/streaks (sloped surfaces), Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            Thin films (general coverage), Thick crusts (aged buildup), Discrete patches (localized contamination), Spots/dots
            (splatter or small leaks), Stains (penetration into the schist), Buildups (accumulation over time).
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. This is due
            to the uneven surface texture of schist, variations in application or leakage, and the influence of gravity. Perfectly
            uniform distribution is rare.
        serpentine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, typically light brown. Over time, it darkens
            due to oxidation and thermal degradation, becoming thicker and more viscous. Aged contamination forms a hard,
            crusty layer, often black or dark brown, with potential for cracking and flaking. Thickness increases significantly
            with age.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin film, then thickens over time. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation
            occurs in enclosed spaces with consistent oil mist. Layering effects can occur due to intermittent cleaning or
            changes in oil type. Timeframes: Thin film within hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant crusting
            within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #8B4513 (SaddleBrown) to #A0522D (Sienna). Moderately aged: #654321 (DarkBrown)
            with hints of #B8860B (DarkGoldenrod) due to oxidation. Heavily aged: #2F4F4F (DarkSlateGray) to #000000 (Black)
            with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining if iron particles are present.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, uniform coating in
            enclosed areas, accumulation in crevices and along edges, drip marks on vertical surfaces. Point source spreading
            is common, creating radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher near the source of contamination (e.g., lubrication
            points, leaks). Edges and crevices tend to accumulate more oil/grease due to surface tension and capillary action.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas may accumulate more due
            to reduced cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration (5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with some areas
            of bare metal still visible (25-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating with significant discoloration
            (100-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with a thick, crusty layer (500 μm - 5 mm+).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on serpentine typically presents as a dark, glossy or matte coating,
            ranging from light brown to nearly black. The texture varies from a thin, oily film to a thick, crusty deposit,
            often accumulating in crevices and low-lying areas. Coverage patterns depend on the source and duration of contamination,
            ranging from sparse spotting to complete surface coverage.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (radial), edge accumulation, drip marks
            (streaky/linear), localized concentrations near fittings, and uniform coating in enclosed spaces. The specific
            pattern depends heavily on the source of the contamination and the geometry of the serpentine surface.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            This is especially pronounced in areas with poor airflow. The mechanism is driven by the tendency of liquids to
            minimize surface area and fill confined spaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Fills
            depressions and follows contours of the serpentine surface.
          gravity_influence: Significant downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker
            deposits. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hangs from overhead surfaces in the form of
            drips or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a more matte appearance. Heavily aged deposits tend to be matte regardless of lighting. Iridescence
            or rainbow effects can occur with very thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, slippery, smooth to the touch. Moderately aged: Sticky, tacky, slightly rough due
            to oxidation and polymerization. Heavily aged: Hard, crusty, brittle, sometimes powdery or granular. May exhibit
            a slight sheen when fresh, transitioning to a matte finish with age. Grain is generally absent unless particulate
            matter is embedded.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-5 mm or more. Varies significantly
            based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, runs/streaks from leaks, pools/puddles in low-lying areas,
            thin films on flat surfaces, thick crusts in areas of heavy buildup, discrete patches near lubrication points,
            stains from prolonged exposure, and uniform coatings in enclosed spaces. The formation mechanism is primarily
            driven by gravity, surface tension, and the rate of contamination.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations in
            surface geometry, contamination source locations, and cleaning practices. Uniformity is more likely in enclosed
            areas with consistent exposure to oil mist.
        shale:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film with a dark brown color. Over time, the oil
            oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darker, matte appearance. The texture changes from oily to sticky to crusty.
            Thickness increases with continued exposure. Aged contamination often incorporates dust and debris, resulting
            in a dull, greyish-black color.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens at contact points
            (days), spreads from edges inward (days/weeks), and eventually forms a crusty layer (months). Point sources expand
            outward. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity)
            can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization. The timeframe depends heavily on the rate of contamination
            and environmental conditions.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #4A3A24 (Dark Olive Brown), often with iridescent sheen. Days old: #60463B
            (Dark Brown). Weeks old: #362F2D (Very Dark Brown) with reddish-brown (#800000) edges due to oxidation. Months/Years
            old: #000000 (Black) or #262322 (Jet) with possible greyish (#A9A9A9) dust accumulation. Heavily oxidized: #B7410E
            (Burnt Sienna) rust-colored patches.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is rarely uniform. It tends to form localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, especially
            on vertical surfaces. Edges and crevices are primary accumulation points. Flat surfaces may exhibit pooling. The
            distribution pattern often reflects the source of the contamination (e.g., a leaking pipe will create a streak
            pattern).
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges, corners, and crevices tend to have the heaviest
            buildup. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with higher concentrations at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces
            may have pooled oil. Exposed areas are often cleaner due to weathering and abrasion, while sheltered areas accumulate
            more contamination.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration (5-15 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating with some areas
            of bare shale (15-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating with significant discoloration (50-150 μm).
            Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty buildup completely obscuring the shale surface (>150 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on shale presents as a dark, often iridescent or matte coating, ranging
            from thin films to thick, crusty deposits. The color is typically dark brown to black, with variations depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas, creating
            uneven coverage.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (flow along surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices or
            low spots), and radial patterns (around a central source). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the
            most frequent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to
            surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends to spread along the perimeter before covering the entire surface.
            Uniform distribution is rare. The mechanism is related to the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry strongly influences distribution. Oil accumulates in corners due to capillary
            action. Crevices act as traps, collecting and retaining contamination. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces
            promote dripping. Edges define the boundaries of the contamination. Depressions fill with oil. The physical reasons
            are surface tension, gravity, and capillary forces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets. The angle of the surface directly
            affects the flow rate and accumulation pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and may display iridescent
            rainbow effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of
            the coating. Aged contamination typically has a matte finish and reflects less light. The color appears deeper
            and more saturated under direct light.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With aging and oxidation, it hardens into a crusty, sometimes brittle, layer. Depending on the specific grease
            and environmental conditions, a powdery or slightly crystalline surface may develop. The surface can range from
            glossy when fresh to matte when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. A fresh film can be as thin as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 25-100 μm. Heavy crusts can reach 0.5-2 mm or more, especially in areas of prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the shale), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (at edges
            and corners). Drip marks and thick crusts are common.'
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coverage is rare. The non-uniformity arises from variations in surface roughness, gravity, airflow, and the method
            of contamination. Crevices and low-lying areas tend to accumulate more contamination than smooth, exposed surfaces.
        silicon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light
            amber color. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, opaque, and significantly darker, often exhibiting
            a hardened, crusty texture. Oxidation products contribute to a varnish-like appearance.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye, then thickens over
            time. It may begin at contact points or edges and then spread inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible,
            but more often, it occurs from point sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, influencing
            the buildup rate. Within hours, a thin film is established. Within days, color changes become noticeable. Within
            months, significant thickening and hardening occur.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber or golden color (#FFBF00), transitioning to
            a deeper amber (#FF7E00) within days. As it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a reddish-brown (#A52A2A), eventually
            becoming a dark brown or black (#000000) with prolonged exposure and heat. Iridescent sheens are common in thin
            films.
          common_patterns: Buildup commonly occurs in localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, particularly on vertical surfaces.
            It tends to accumulate in crevices, corners, and around edges due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat
            surfaces often exhibit a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and in crevices. Vertical walls exhibit
            drip marks and streaks, with heavier accumulation at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces may have more uniform coverage
            but can also exhibit pooling in low spots. Sheltered areas often accumulate more contamination than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, a faint sheen or a few isolated spots, <1 μm thickness.
            Light (10-30%): a thin, patchy film, slightly visible color variations, 1-5 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): a
            more continuous film with noticeable color and texture, 5-20 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): a thick, opaque layer
            with significant buildup in certain areas, 20-100 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): a very thick, crusty layer covering
            almost the entire surface, >100 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on silicon typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the
            oil's composition, age, and environmental conditions, often exhibiting a sticky or tacky texture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (following flow paths), and localized concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to creep along the perimeter, forming a thicker layer at the boundary. The
            center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating or remain relatively clean.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act as barriers, collecting
            oil and preventing it from spreading further. Contours guide flow patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow behavior, pooling at bottom edges, drip
            marks from top to bottom, and vertical streaking. On horizontal surfaces, oil settles and spreads, forming a more
            uniform layer. The rate of downward flow depends on the oil's viscosity and surface tension.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films can exhibit an iridescent sheen due to thin-film interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of aged buildup. Glossiness decreases
            with age as the surface becomes rougher and more oxidized, transitioning to a matte finish.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With significant
            oxidation and polymerization, it can become a hard, crusty, or even slightly crystalline solid. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (invisible to the naked eye) to several millimeters in extreme
            cases. Thin films are typically 10-100 nm, while moderate buildup can be 1-10 μm. Heavy accumulations can reach
            0.1-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform coatings), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), and buildups (at joints
            or seams).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Variations are caused by uneven deposition, surface imperfections, temperature gradients, and the influence
            of gravity.
        silicon carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, glossy film with a light brown or amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more matte. It often develops a crusty
            or hardened surface and may incorporate dust, dirt, and other debris, leading to a rougher texture and a duller
            appearance. The color shifts towards black or very dark brown.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin film (hours). 2) Thickens over time due
            to continued deposition (days). 3) Begins at contact points or lubrication points and spreads outward (days/weeks).
            4) Accumulates at edges and in crevices (weeks/months). 5) Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common.
            6) Point sources expand outward, creating localized deposits (weeks/months). 7) Layering effects can occur with
            repeated applications or changes in oil/grease type (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation (years).'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), and eventually a near-black
            (#000000) with a possible slight reddish tint (#800000) due to iron oxide contamination from wear particles.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots around lubrication points, streaks and runs on vertical
            surfaces, and accumulation in crevices and corners. A thin, uniform film may initially cover the entire surface,
            but thicker deposits tend to form in areas where oil/grease is concentrated or where debris collects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces and corners also tend to accumulate more oil/grease due to gravity. Vertical
            walls exhibit streaks and runs, with thicker deposits at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate more contamination
            than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action from airflow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy film with some visible streaks or spots. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous
            film with thicker deposits in some areas. Thickness: 10-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, almost continuous coating
            with significant buildup in crevices and corners. Thickness: 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty
            coating that obscures most of the underlying surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on silicon carbide typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with
            variations depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying
            areas due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually only with very
            fresh contamination). 2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension and capillary action). 3) Point source
            spreading (around lubrication points or leaks). 4) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from
            the source). 5) Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized contamination). 6) Streaky/linear (on vertical
            surfaces due to gravity).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to spread along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This is especially noticeable on flat surfaces and around the perimeter of components. The mechanism is
            driven by the minimization of surface energy, which favors the formation of a meniscus at the edge.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows contours, creating a non-uniform coating.
            It can bridge gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior,
            leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation
            of gravity's influence. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, forming puddles or thicker layers. It runs
            down slopes, creating a gradient in thickness. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming drips.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker areas and shadows, making the buildup more visible. Aged contamination
            typically has a matte finish due to the accumulation of particulate matter and oxidation products. Iridescence
            is rare but possible with very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry. Over
            time, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular or
            amorphous structure, depending on the specific additives and oxidation products present. It feels greasy initially,
            then becomes increasingly rough and abrasive as particulate matter accumulates.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5
            mm) or more for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 2) Runs/streaks (on vertical
            surfaces). 3) Pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces). 4) Thin films (initial stage of contamination). 5) Thick
            crusts (aged contamination). 6) Discrete patches (localized contamination). 7) Spots/dots (splatter or mist).
            8) Stains (penetration into porous areas, if present). 9) Buildups (accumulation in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, the surface geometry, and the
            environmental conditions. Uneven application, gravity, and the presence of crevices or other surface features
            contribute to the non-uniformity.
        silicon carbide (sic):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, transparent or light amber film. Aged
            contamination (months/years old) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more viscous. It often hardens into
            a crusty or tar-like substance, exhibiting a matte finish and potentially flaking or cracking. The color shifts
            towards darker browns and blacks.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days). It often begins at contact
            points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible, but less common than point sources
            that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber or honey color (#F0C808). As it oxidizes and
            ages, it transitions to a burnt sienna (#B7410E), then to a dark brown (#3E2723), and finally to a near-black
            (#212121) with prolonged exposure and heat. Some formulations with molybdenum disulfide may exhibit a dark gray,
            almost metallic sheen.
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots, streaks, and drip marks, especially on vertical surfaces.
            It accumulates preferentially in crevices, edges, and areas with surface imperfections. On flat surfaces, it may
            spread into a thin film or form irregular patches. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            surface tension. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas often accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal
            surfaces may have pooling.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A few scattered spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable spots and streaks, with some areas still clean. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            coverage with visible buildup in crevices and edges. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage
            with a thick, dark layer. Thickness: 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with a very thick, crusty layer.
            Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Silicon Carbide (SiC) typically presents as a non-uniform coating,
            ranging from a thin, almost invisible film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly
            based on the oil type, age, temperature, and exposure conditions, but generally exhibits a sticky or tacky texture
            and tends to accumulate in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary
            action), point source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from fluid flow or wiping), and
            localized concentrations (in crevices or low points). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges on Silicon Carbide (SiC).
            This is due to surface tension and capillary action, which draw the fluid towards the edges. The fluid tends to
            wet the surface and minimize its surface energy by concentrating at the perimeter.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling depressions
            and following contours. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating runs and
            streaks. It collects at edges due to capillary action. These effects are driven by fluid dynamics and surface
            energy minimization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, forming a layer that thickens
            over time. Runs down slopes are observed, with thicker deposits at the bottom. Hanging from overhead surfaces
            is possible, forming drips that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of aged buildup. A thin film may show slight iridescence,
            especially with certain additives. Aged buildup generally has a matte finish.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to oxidize.
            With age and heat exposure, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly crystalline, especially if calcium sulfonates
            are present. The surface can feel rough to the touch, particularly with heavy buildup, and may exhibit a slight
            tackiness even when seemingly dry.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases with prolonged exposure and high temperatures can reach thicknesses of 5
            mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from fluid flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (on smooth surfaces), thick crusts (with age and heat), discrete
            patches (from localized contamination), spots/dots (from splattering), stains (penetration into porous areas),
            and buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients, fluid dynamics,
            and the presence of localized contamination sources.
        silicon germanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, glossy film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) darkens to a dark brown or black, becomes thicker and more viscous, and may develop
            a crusty or gummy texture. The surface loses its gloss and becomes matte. Oxidation products and particulate matter
            contribute to the darkening and thickening.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often originating at contact points or lubrication
            sources. It then spreads outward, thickening over time. Edges tend to accumulate contamination faster than the
            center. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible on flat surfaces. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects occur as new contamination is deposited on top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Translucent amber (#F0C808) with slight iridescence. Initial oxidation:
            Light brown (#A67B5B). Moderate oxidation: Medium brown (#8B4513) with reddish undertones. Heavy oxidation/aging:
            Dark brown to almost black (#301900) with matte finish. Sulfurized additive reaction: Greenish-brown (#4A5D23)
            in localized spots.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running,
            and accumulation in crevices and corners. Flat surfaces tend to collect a more uniform coating, while vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges often show a thicker buildup due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low points also accumulate more contamination. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient with heavier
            buildup at the bottom due to gravity. Flat surfaces tend to have a more even distribution, but may still have
            localized variations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible, a few scattered spots or a very thin film. Light (10-30%):
            A thin, patchy film with some visible streaks or spots. Moderate (30-60%): A more continuous film with noticeable
            variations in thickness and color. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, almost continuous coating with significant buildup
            in certain areas. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, continuous coating with heavy buildup and potential crust formation.
            Thickness increases proportionally with coverage.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Silicon Germanium typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating
            ranging from a light sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from translucent amber to dark brown, depending
            on age and composition. Coverage patterns are often influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to localized
            accumulations and streaks.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication points),
            gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution), streaky/linear
            (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and uniform coating (on flat surfaces). Point
            source spreading and localized concentrations are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The liquid tends to spread along the perimeter of the surface. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, or may be relatively clean. This behavior is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Accumulates in corners due to capillary action.
            Builds up in crevices and depressions due to gravity and surface tension. Pools on flat areas. Drips on vertical
            surfaces. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges small gaps. Fills
            depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal
            surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible with very viscous contamination.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte finish, reflecting
            less light. Iridescence may be visible in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and tacky. Heavy buildup can form a crusty or gummy surface. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter
            embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can feel slightly rough due to accumulated debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-5 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 100-500 μm or
            even exceeding 1 mm in extreme cases. The thickness depends on the source of contamination, duration of exposure,
            and environmental conditions.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (in depressions), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy buildup), discrete
            patches (uneven distribution), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (discoloration of the surface), and uniform
            coatings (on smooth surfaces). Drip marks and thin films are common.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity is affected by surface roughness, airflow, temperature gradients, and the method
            of contamination. Smooth, horizontal surfaces are more likely to have a more uniform coating than rough or vertical
            surfaces.
        silicon nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, light amber film. Aged contamination (months/years)
            darkens to a dark brown or black color, thickens significantly, and becomes more viscous and crusty. Oxidation
            and polymerization increase the tackiness and reduce the lubricity.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or edges. It then spreads outward,
            thickening over time. The rate of accumulation depends on factors such as lubricant type, temperature, and operating
            conditions. Layering effects can occur as fresh lubricant is added on top of aged, oxidized grease. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can also influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: #F8E71C (light amber/yellowish). Partially Oxidized: #D4A373 (tan/light brown). Moderately
            Oxidized: #A0522D (sienna brown). Heavily Oxidized: #654321 (dark brown/chocolate). Aged/Burned: #221F1F (near
            black).'
          common_patterns: Accumulation often starts at edges, crevices, and areas of high stress or friction. It tends to
            form drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools on horizontal surfaces. Over time, it can spread from these initial
            points to cover larger areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges, corners, and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more grease than vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Exposed areas may experience more rapid oxidation and buildup compared to sheltered areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick. Light (10-30%): Patchy coverage,
            light amber color, 5-15 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coverage, tan/light brown color, 15-50 μm
            thick. Heavy (60-85%): Opaque, dark brown color, 50-200 μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty, near-black color,
            >200 μm thick.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on silicon nitride typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating.
            Initially, it appears as a thin, translucent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with a color range
            from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily to sticky and slightly crusty as it ages
            and oxidizes.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), pooling (on horizontal surfaces),
            and patchy/spotty coverage (due to uneven application or wear).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This effect
            is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Edges act as barriers,
            preventing uniform spreading and promoting buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior results in pooling at
            bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces experience settling
            and accumulation. The rate of downward flow varies with viscosity and temperature.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface irregularities. Aged, oxidized grease often has a
            matte finish due to surface roughness and carbonization.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and viscous. As it ages and oxidizes, it can develop
            a slightly crusty or gummy texture. Microscopic examination may reveal fine particulate matter embedded within
            the grease matrix. It feels tacky to the touch, and can leave a residue.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >1 mm.'
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial coverage), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (localized contamination), and stains (penetration into surface pores).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly
            uniform due to variations in surface finish, temperature gradients, and lubricant application methods. Areas near
            lubrication points or seals tend to have higher concentrations.
        silver:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film with a light brown or amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes significantly darker, thicker, and more viscous. It may develop a hard,
            crusty surface and incorporate dust and debris, further darkening the color and increasing the roughness.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points (e.g., screw heads, joints) and spreads outward. Buildup can also start at edges and move inward.
            The accumulation can be gradual and uniform, or it can occur from point sources that expand outward. Layering
            effects may be visible, especially with intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination might appear as a translucent amber (#F0C808) or light brown (#A07A55). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#4A3020), and eventually a near-black
            (#221E1F) with possible iridescent sheens.
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms streaks, drip marks, and localized pools, especially on vertical or
            inclined surfaces. It tends to accumulate in corners, crevices, and around edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform coating, but often with variations in thickness.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Bottom surfaces and sheltered areas also tend to accumulate more contamination due to gravity
            and reduced exposure to cleaning or wear. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with heavier concentrations
            at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): A few scattered spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Thickness:
            <1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy coating with some areas of bare silver visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate
            (30-60%): A more continuous coating, but still with some variations in thickness and areas of bare silver. Thickness:
            5-25 μm. Heavy (60-85%): A thick, nearly continuous coating that obscures most of the silver surface. Thickness:
            25-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very thick, crusty layer that completely covers the silver surface. Thickness: >100
            μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on silver presents as a viscous, often dark-colored coating that can
            range from a thin, barely visible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically brown or black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas
            due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from a leak or spill), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices
            or low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: The buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there compared to the center areas.
            Uniform distribution is rare unless the contamination is applied in a very controlled manner.
          geometry_effects: The buildup accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, collecting at edges and following contours.
            It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions. Sharp edges tend to have higher concentrations than smooth surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. It causes downward flow behavior, pooling at
            bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, vertical streaking, and settling on horizontal surfaces. Runs down
            slopes are common, and the buildup can hang from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like structures in extreme
            cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Depending on the composition and thickness, iridescent or rainbow-like effects
            may be visible, especially in thin films. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker areas and
            shadows, emphasizing the texture.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a smooth, oily film when fresh to a sticky, tacky consistency as it ages.
            With prolonged exposure and oxidation, it can become a hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle solid. Microscopic
            examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: The thickness can range from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or greater, resembling
            a thick crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow patterns),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into the silver surface),
            uniform coatings (rare, but possible with controlled application), buildups (accumulation over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, gravity, surface irregularities, and differences
            in temperature and humidity across the surface.
        slate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, glossy, amber-colored film. Over time, it darkens, thickens, and
            becomes less glossy, transitioning to a matte or semi-gloss finish. Aged contamination is often darker, thicker,
            and may exhibit a crusty or waxy texture. Oxidation products can create a slight greenish or bluish sheen.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, translucent film upon initial contact
            (hours). 2) Accumulation begins at contact points (e.g., drip locations) and spreads outward (days). 3) Edges
            and crevices accumulate oil/grease faster than flat surfaces (weeks). 4) The film thickens and darkens over time
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of particulate matter (months). 5) Layering effects may occur with repeated
            contamination events, creating distinct layers of oil/grease (years).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber, close to #D4A373'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Dark amber to light brown, #A0785A'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown with reddish undertones, #8B4513 (BurlyWood)'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to almost black, #362F2F, often with a slight greenish or bluish sheen due
            to oxidation products.'
          - 'Extreme Buildup (years): Black, #000000, potentially with rust-colored (#B7410E) staining around the edges if
            metallic components are present and exposed to moisture.'
          common_patterns: Accumulation is often localized, concentrating in crevices, along edges, and in areas where oil
            drips or spills occur. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate thicker layers than vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Crevices and porous areas of the slate act as collection
            points.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to gravity. Corners and sheltered
            areas often accumulate more oil/grease than exposed areas. Flat surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage than
            irregular surfaces.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, crusty layer completely obscuring the slate surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              thickness: '>500 μm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating with significant buildup. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              thickness: 100-500 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with some visible accumulation in crevices. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              thickness: 5-25 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable coating with darker areas of accumulation. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              thickness: 25-100 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible. Thickness: 1-5 μm.'
              thickness: 1-5 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on slate typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that darkens the
            slate's natural color. Initially, it appears as a thin, glossy film, transitioning to a thicker, matte or semi-gloss
            layer with prolonged exposure and accumulation. The distribution is often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation: Buildup along the edges of slate
            tiles or surfaces. 2) Point source spreading: Radial patterns emanating from a specific point of leakage or spillage.
            3) Streaky/linear: Vertical streaks on vertical surfaces due to gravity. 4) Localized concentrations: Puddles
            or pools in depressions or low-lying areas. 5) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution across the surface, often
            due to uneven application or cleaning.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to
            surface tension and capillary action. The edges act as barriers, preventing the oil/grease from spreading further.
            Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            drip marks. Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil/grease from spreading further.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces, resulting
            in drip marks and pooling at bottom edges. Horizontal surfaces experience settling and accumulation. Slopes exhibit
            runs. Overhead surfaces may have hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the dark color and uneven distribution more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish, reducing reflectivity. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes be observed in thin films due to light
            interference.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. With significant
            buildup, it can develop a crusty or waxy texture. Close inspection may reveal fine particulate matter embedded
            within the grease layer. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte or slightly textured with age and
            oxidation.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.5-2 mm or more
            in extreme cases. Average thickness in moderate contamination scenarios is typically 50-200 μm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films: A barely visible layer covering the surface. 2)
            Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by oil/grease running down vertical surfaces. 3) Runs/streaks: Similar to
            drip marks but often wider and more diffuse. 4) Pools/puddles: Accumulation in depressions or low-lying areas.
            5) Thick crusts: Hardened layers of aged oil/grease in areas of heavy buildup. 6) Stains: Discoloration of the
            slate surface caused by prolonged contact with oil/grease.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface texture, gravity, the method of oil/grease
            application, and the presence of cleaning or wiping.
        soapstone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, oily film with a light amber color. Aged
            contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker (brown to black), and more solid. The surface may develop
            a crusty or cracked appearance due to oxidation and polymerization. The aged material is less soluble and more
            difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or leak sources then spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and then move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward in a radial pattern.
            Layering effects can occur with intermittent contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, influencing the buildup rate.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Light Buildup: Yellowish-brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderate Buildup: Medium brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavy Buildup: Dark brown to almost black (#301900)'
          - 'Aged Buildup: Black with a possible greyish bloom from oxidation (#000000)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coating (especially with light contamination), localized spots
            and patches, streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces, and accumulation in crevices and along edges. Initial
            accumulation often occurs at points of contact or areas where oil/grease is introduced. Gravity plays a significant
            role in the distribution, leading to downward flow and pooling.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and
            reduced cleaning effectiveness. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity-induced
            flow. Corners and sheltered areas accumulate more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip
            marks, while horizontal surfaces may have pooled oil/grease.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: A very thick, crusty buildup that completely covers the surface. Color is black (#000000). Thickness
                is > 200 μm, possibly exceeding 2 mm.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: A thick, dark coating that obscures much of the original surface. Color is dark brown to almost
                black (#301900). Thickness is 50-200 μm.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: A thin, but noticeable film covering a portion of the surface. Color is yellowish-brown (#C49102).
                Thickness is 1-10 μm.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: A more substantial coating with visible color variations. Color is medium brown (#8B4513). Thickness
                is 10-50 μm.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Color is typically light amber (#F8DE7E). Thickness
                is < 1 μm.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on soapstone manifests as a darkening and discoloration of the surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to thick, crusty deposits. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown/black
            with increasing age and thickness. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to localized accumulations, often
            concentrated in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (thin films), edge accumulation (capillary
            action), point source spreading (radial patterns), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application), streaky/linear (drip marks), localized concentrations (crevices), and radial
            patterns (around a leak). Edge accumulation and drip marks are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated
            band. Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is due to the higher surface area to volume
            ratio at edges, which promotes adhesion and retention.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced cleaning access. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical
            surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours, conforming to the
            shape of the soapstone. It may bridge small gaps or fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a dominant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks on
            vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hanging from overhead
            surfaces is less common but can occur with very viscous grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and surface
            irregularities. Iridescence is generally not observed unless there is a very thin film of oil on a smooth surface.
          texture_details: The texture varies depending on the age and composition of the buildup. Fresh contamination is
            typically smooth and slightly sticky. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes more viscous and eventually hardens
            into a crusty or waxy solid. At high magnification (SEM), the surface may exhibit a granular or amorphous structure.
            It feels greasy initially, then tacky, and finally hard and brittle.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) to heavy buildup (100 μm - 2 mm or more). The thickness
            depends on the source of contamination, the duration of exposure, and the cleaning frequency.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (uniform coating), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the soapstone), uniform coatings (light
            contamination), and buildups (accumulated over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. Mostly uniform distribution
            occurs with thin films applied evenly. Moderately patchy distribution is common due to uneven application or localized
            sources. Highly variable/irregular distribution is seen with heavy contamination and infrequent cleaning. Concentration
            is often higher in areas that are difficult to access or clean.
        soda-lime glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is typically a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks
            to months), it darkens due to oxidation and polymerization, becoming more viscous and sticky. The thickness increases
            as more material accumulates. Very old contamination (years) can harden into a brittle, dark brown or black crust.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours). Begins at contact points and spreads outward (days). Accumulation
            is often faster at edges (days). Thickens over time due to continued deposition and oxidation (weeks). Can form
            distinct layers if there are intermittent contamination events (months). Seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to golden yellow (#FFDA63). Aged contamination: Dark
            amber (#795548) to burnt sienna (#B7410E) to almost black (#212121) in extreme cases. Oxidation products can introduce
            reddish-brown hues (#A52A2A). Sulfurized additives may contribute a greenish-brown tint (#808000).'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, accumulation along edges and corners
            due to surface tension, and a general tendency to spread from a point source. Uniform coating is rare unless deliberately
            applied. Streaks are common from wiping or fluid flow.
          concentration_variations: Edges and corners tend to have heavier concentrations due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom edges of vertical surfaces accumulate drips. Crevices and joints trap oil/grease. Flat horizontal surfaces
            can pool the contaminant. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation or removal by airflow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (1-5 μm). Light (10-30%):
            Thin, translucent film with some visible accumulation (5-20 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, some areas
            of thicker buildup (20-50 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Opaque coating, significant buildup in certain areas (50-100 μm).
            Extreme (>85%): Complete surface coverage, thick, hardened crust (100 μm - 1 mm+).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on soda-lime glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque coating,
            ranging in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from a smooth, oily film to a hardened, sticky
            residue, often exhibiting localized accumulations and drip patterns. Coverage can range from sparse spotting to
            complete surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (circular or elliptical), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven distribution), streaky/linear (from wiping
            or flow), localized concentrations (around joints or seals), and drip patterns (vertical surfaces). Edge accumulation
            is also very common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wet the
            edges more readily than the center. This is especially noticeable on flat glass surfaces. The effect is less pronounced
            on complex geometries.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices and joints. Pools on flat
            areas. Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges. Follows contours of the glass. Bridges small gaps. Fills
            depressions and scratches.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is significant on vertical and angled surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes. Hanging droplets can form on overhead surfaces. The flow rate depends on the viscosity of the
            oil/grease and the angle of the surface.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy or oily sheen under direct light. Aged contamination tends
            to have a more matte finish. Iridescence (rainbow effect) can occur in very thin films due to interference. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the yellow/amber tones, while direct sunlight emphasizes the darker brown
            hues.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Oily, slippery, smooth. Aged: Sticky, tacky, gummy, sometimes hardened and crusty. Can
            feel slightly rough if particulate matter is embedded. At high magnification, may exhibit a slightly granular
            or amorphous structure. The surface can be smooth or rippled depending on the application method and drying conditions.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm or more. Extreme
            buildup can reach several millimeters, resembling a thick, hardened coating.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (angled surfaces), pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots
            (splatter), stains (penetration into surface imperfections), uniform coatings (rare, intentional application),
            buildups (accumulations over time).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular is the most common. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with
            minor variations can occur if the oil/grease was deliberately applied as a coating. The non-uniformity is caused
            by variations in surface energy, gravity, airflow, and the method of contamination.
        stainless steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent or translucent film with a light
            color and oily texture. Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. It hardens,
            forming a crusty or gummy layer. The color shifts towards dark brown or black, and the surface may become dull
            and matte. Rust may form underneath the buildup if the stainless steel's passivity is compromised.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days and weeks. It often
            begins at contact points or leak sources and spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent oil mist. Point sources expand outward, creating radial
            patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination often appears as a light amber or golden color (#FFBF00 to #FFD700), transitioning
            to a medium brown (#A67B5B) within days. As it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a dark brown (#654321) or even
            black (#000000), sometimes with reddish-brown (#8B4513) hues indicating rust formation on the underlying steel
            if the protective layer is compromised. Under certain conditions, a bluish or rainbow-like iridescent sheen may
            be visible due to thin-film interference.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in horizontal crevices, and a
            general accumulation in areas with restricted airflow. Splatter patterns are also common near machinery. A thin,
            even film can develop on surfaces exposed to oil mist. Accumulation is often heaviest near the source of the oil
            leak or application point.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces and crevices accumulate more oil due to gravity. Sheltered areas with less airflow also
            tend to have higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with heavier concentrations at the bottom.
            Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate pools of oil.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy film, slight discoloration, thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, darker
            color, thickness 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating, significant buildup, thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, potentially dripping, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on stainless steel presents as a viscous coating, ranging from a thin,
            iridescent sheen to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the oil's
            composition, age, temperature, and environmental conditions. It typically accumulates in low points, crevices,
            and areas of high friction or contact.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (from oil mist), edge accumulation
            (due to surface tension), point source spreading (from leaks), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with
            distance), patchy/spotty (from splatters), streaky/linear (from drips), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            and radial patterns (around rotating parts). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to creep along edges, forming a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This
            effect is particularly pronounced on sharp edges and corners. Uniform distribution is rare.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action and surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces,
            collects at edges, follows contours, bridges gaps, and fills depressions. Sharp edges often act as collection
            points.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Oil
            pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Runs down slopes are observed.
            Oil hangs from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen and may display iridescent colors
            due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker colors and textures of
            aged buildup. A matte finish is common with heavily oxidized and dried-out deposits. The sheen decreases with
            age.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to oxidize.
            Aged buildup can become hard, crusty, and even slightly brittle. Depending on the specific additives and contaminants
            present, it may also exhibit a slightly granular or crystalline texture at a microscopic level. It feels slippery
            when fresh, and rough or abrasive when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in
            areas of persistent leakage or spillage.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (general coverage), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (splatters), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetrated into surface imperfections), uniform coatings (oil
            mist), buildups (accumulated layers), and potentially crystalline structures (from additive precipitation).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare except in cases of deliberate coating application or consistent oil mist exposure. The non-uniformity
            is caused by variations in surface geometry, airflow, temperature, and the location of oil sources.
        stainless steel 304:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, oily film, often with an iridescent sheen. Over time, it
            darkens due to oxidation and thermal degradation. The texture changes from smooth to sticky to hard and crusty.
            Thickness increases with continued deposition and polymerization. Aged deposits are significantly harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens
            and becomes more visible, often starting at contact points or leak sources. Edges and crevices accumulate oil
            faster than flat surfaces. Over months, the oil oxidizes and hardens, forming a crusty layer. Layering effects
            can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate
            of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with subtle yellow/amber tones (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Lightly Aged (days): Light brown (#A67B5B) with a slight orange tint, often translucent.'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Medium brown (#8B4513) with darker edges, becoming more opaque.'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Dark brown to almost black (#362F2E), often with a matte finish.'
          - 'Extremely Aged (years): Black (#000000) with a hardened, crusty texture, potentially exhibiting rust-orange (#B7410E)
            staining underneath if corrosion has occurred.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling
            in low-lying areas, accumulation along edges and welds, and spreading from point sources like leaking seals or
            fittings. Crevices and threads of fasteners are prime accumulation spots.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity.
            Edges and corners tend to accumulate more oil due to surface tension. Crevices and threads of fasteners are also
            high-concentration areas. Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate a relatively uniform layer, but this is often
            disrupted by drips and splashes.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, hardened crust covering almost the entire surface. Thickness: >1 mm.'
              visual: Black, crusty surface, obscuring the original metal finish.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating with limited exposed metal. Thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm.'
              visual: Dark, greasy appearance, significant buildup in crevices.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, patchy film with some visible discoloration. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
              visual: Slightly discolored surface, visible streaks and spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Noticeable coating with darker areas and some exposed metal. Thickness: 10-100 μm.'
              visual: Brownish or blackish coating, uneven distribution.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or streaks, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.'
              visual: Barely perceptible sheen, isolated droplets.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on stainless steel 304 typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly with age,
            temperature, and the specific composition of the lubricant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and low-lying areas
            due to gravity and surface tension.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak),
            2) Streaky/linear (drip marks on vertical surfaces), 3) Edge accumulation (surface tension effects), 4) Localized
            concentrations (in crevices or around fasteners), 5) Patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal attempts), 6)
            Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center of a flat surface. This
            effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to surface tension and capillary action. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act
            as barriers, causing accumulation. Threads of fasteners trap oil. Depressions fill with oil.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. It causes downward flow on vertical surfaces, resulting in
            drip marks and streaking. Oil pools at the bottom edges of surfaces. Horizontal surfaces accumulate settling dust
            and debris within the oil layer. Overhanging surfaces can develop hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil exhibits a noticeable sheen and iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of aged buildup. Heavily oxidized deposits have a matte
            finish and absorb light, appearing darker. The presence of metallic wear particles can create a subtle metallic
            sheen in some areas.
          texture_details: Fresh oil is smooth and slippery to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. With further
            aging and oxidation, it hardens into a crusty or gummy residue. Close inspection may reveal a fine, granular texture
            due to the presence of wear debris and oxidation products. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte
            when heavily oxidized.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in sheltered
            areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks), 2) Runs/streaks (irregular flow
            patterns), 3) Pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), 4) Thin films (initial contamination), 5) Thick crusts (aged,
            oxidized deposits), 6) Discrete patches (localized spills or splatters), 7) Stains (residual discoloration after
            cleaning), 8) Buildups (accumulations in crevices or corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically highly variable/irregular. It is rarely perfectly uniform.
            Variations are caused by differences in surface temperature, airflow, gravity, and the location of contamination
            sources. Sheltered areas tend to accumulate more buildup than exposed areas.
        stainless steel 316:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks/months),
            it darkens due to oxidation and polymerization, becoming thicker and more viscous. Aged contamination forms a
            hard, crusty layer that is significantly darker and more difficult to remove. Thickness increases substantially
            with age.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin, transparent film within hours of exposure. Thickens gradually over days and
            weeks, becoming more visible and darker in color. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads
            outwards. Accumulation is faster in areas with higher temperatures or exposure to oil mist. Layering effects can
            occur if cleaning is infrequent, resulting in distinct layers of contamination. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh oil: Light amber (#F0C808) with a slight iridescent sheen. Initial buildup: Yellowish-brown
            (#A0785A). Moderate buildup: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish undertones. Aged/oxidized: Black (#000000) or very
            dark brown (#221B15) with matte finish. Heavily contaminated/burnt: Near-black with possible blueish-grey hues
            (#4682B4) due to heat exposure.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, accumulation in crevices
            and around fasteners, uniform thin film on surfaces exposed to oil mist, heavier buildup on horizontal surfaces
            due to settling, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Patterns often originate from point sources and spread outwards.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavy concentration: Edges, crevices, low points, areas near lubrication points, and
            horizontal surfaces. Light concentration: Center of flat surfaces, vertical walls (except for drip marks), and
            areas exposed to frequent cleaning. Top vs. bottom: Bottom areas tend to have heavier buildup due to gravity.
            Sheltered areas accumulate more than exposed areas.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin, translucent
            film, 5-15 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable brown or black coating, 15-50 μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%):
            Thick, opaque layer, 50-200 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, >200 μm thickness, potentially
            exceeding 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Stainless Steel 316 typically presents as a non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a barely visible sheen to a thick, dark brown or black layer. The texture varies from smooth and oily when
            fresh to sticky and crusty when aged, often accumulating in crevices and low points. Coverage patterns are highly
            dependent on the source of contamination and environmental conditions.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak), Streaky/linear
            (from drips or wiping), Localized concentrations (around joints or fittings), Patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or cleaning), Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), and Edge accumulation (due to surface
            tension effects).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The center of large, flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating. Edges act as collection points for
            oil and grease that flows across the surface. This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with a rough or textured
            finish.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Pools on flat
            areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Collects at edges due to
            surface tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges small gaps and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to
            have less buildup due to drainage.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is dominant on vertical and inclined surfaces, resulting in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and low points. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces,
            leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes, creating angled streaks. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible
            but less common due to surface tension limitations.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil exhibits a glossy sheen under direct light, reflecting light specularly. Moderate buildup
            has a more matte finish but can still show some gloss when wet. Aged contamination is typically matte and absorbs
            light. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects. Direct sunlight can accelerate oxidation
            and darkening.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Smooth, oily, slippery to the touch. Moderate buildup: Sticky, slightly tacky, may have
            a slight graininess. Aged: Hard, crusty, brittle, potentially with a rough, uneven surface. Heavily oxidized:
            Dry, powdery in some areas, hard and cracked in others. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures
            from additives.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 10-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme buildup:
            >1 mm. Varies significantly based on exposure and cleaning frequency.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), Runs/streaks (angled surfaces), Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces),
            Thin films (general coverage), Thick crusts (aged buildup), Discrete patches (splatter or localized leaks), Spots/dots
            (oil mist), Stains (penetration into surface imperfections), and Buildups (around fittings and joints).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform due to variations
            in surface finish, temperature gradients, airflow, and the method of oil application. It is typically concentrated
            near the source of contamination and thins out with distance. Even 'uniform' coatings will have microscopic variations
            in thickness.
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often amber or light brown. Over time (days
            to weeks), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more viscous. Months to years of exposure lead to a hardened, crusty,
            black layer that may crack and flake. Rust formation underneath the grease layer becomes visible as orange or
            reddish-brown discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points or lubrication sources. It then spreads
            outward, following surface contours and influenced by gravity. Edges tend to accumulate grease early in the process.
            Over time (days to weeks), the film thickens and darkens. Months of exposure lead to a hardened crust. Layering
            effects can occur due to repeated applications or changes in operating conditions. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber to light brown (#A67B5B), almost glossy.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Medium brown (#8B4513) with a hint of red, less glossy.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown (#654321) to brownish-black (#4A4444), matte finish.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) bleed-through from the steel underneath, very
            matte.'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Charcoal gray (#36454F) to black with a dry, cracked appearance.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point sources of contamination often result in radial spreading patterns. On rotating
            equipment, a circular or spiral distribution is common. Uniform coatings are rare, except in controlled application
            scenarios.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and in low-lying areas where
            gravity causes pooling. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with thicker buildup at the bottom
            due to dripping. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to wash-off from rain or cleaning. Sheltered areas tend
            to accumulate more grease.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, encrusted layer of grease. Steel surface is completely obscured. Thickness: >500 μm.'
              thickness: '>500 μm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, continuous layer of grease. Steel surface is largely obscured. Thickness: 50-500 μm.'
              thickness: 50-500 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with noticeable discoloration. Some areas of bare steel are still visible. Thickness:
                1-5 μm.'
              thickness: 1-5 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Significant coverage with a visible layer of grease. Steel surface is partially obscured. Thickness:
                5-50 μm.'
              thickness: 5-50 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible, isolated spots or streaks. Appears as a faint sheen in some areas. Thickness:
                <1 μm.'
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on steel presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges from a
            thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color varies significantly based on age, composition,
            and environmental factors, but typically involves shades of brown, black, and amber. Distribution is often uneven,
            influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1. Edge accumulation (common). 2. Point source spreading
            (around lubrication points). 3. Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 4. Pooling in low areas. 5. Streaky/linear
            (due to wiping or flow). 6. Patchy/spotty (uneven application or wear). Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The grease tends to 'wick' along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center of
            a flat surface. This effect is particularly pronounced in corners and around bolt holes.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges
            act as barriers, causing buildup. Depressions fill with grease. Contours guide the flow of grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Grease runs down slopes. Overhead
            surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations. The rate of downward flow depends on the
            viscosity of the grease and the surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes matte and less reflective. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the uneven distribution
            and variations in thickness. Iridescence (rainbow effect) can sometimes be observed on very thin films due to
            interference effects.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With heavy buildup,
            it becomes crusty, hard, and sometimes brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter embedded
            within the grease matrix. Aged grease can feel gritty due to oxidation and the accumulation of debris. It is generally
            non-crystalline.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can exceed 10 mm in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: 1. Drip marks (vertical streaks). 2. Runs/streaks (angled surfaces).
            3. Pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces). 4. Thin films (initial contamination). 5. Thick crusts (aged buildup).
            6. Discrete patches (localized contamination). 7. Stains (penetration into porous surfaces). Drip marks and thin
            films are the most frequently observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare in industrial settings. Uniformity is affected by application method, operating conditions
            (temperature, pressure, vibration), and the presence of contaminants. Gravity and surface geometry also play significant
            roles.
        stoneware:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a light-colored, oily film. Over time (days to weeks), it darkens
            and thickens due to oxidation and polymerization. Aged contamination (months to years) becomes a hard, dark, crusty
            deposit that is difficult to remove. The surface may exhibit cracking or crazing due to differential thermal expansion.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film, often invisible to the naked eye. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            points) and then spreads outward. Accumulation is faster at edges and in crevices. Over time (days), the film
            thickens and darkens due to oxidation. After months, a hard, crusty layer forms. Layering effects can occur if
            there are intermittent spills or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of
            oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #F0E68C (Khaki) to #D2B48C (Tan). Partially Oxidized: #A0522D (Sienna) with
            hints of #8B4513 (SaddleBrown). Heavily Oxidized/Aged: #654321 (DarkBrown) to almost black #000000, often with
            a reddish-brown tinge #800000 (Maroon) around the edges due to iron oxide interaction with the stoneware.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks are common, especially near machinery or lubrication points. Drip marks
            are frequently observed on vertical surfaces. Accumulation in crevices and along edges is typical due to surface
            tension and capillary action. Flat surfaces often exhibit a more uniform, albeit thin, coating.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have lighter contamination due to runoff, while bottom surfaces accumulate
            drips and pools. Corners tend to trap oil and grease, leading to higher concentrations. Flat horizontal surfaces
            will have more uniform but thinner layers.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film (thickness < 5 μm). Light
            (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, easily wiped off (thickness 5-25 μm). Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable coating, some
            areas of thicker buildup (thickness 25-100 μm). Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating, difficult to remove
            (thickness 100-500 μm). Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, significant accumulation in crevices (thickness
            > 500 μm).'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on stoneware presents as a viscous, often dark, coating that varies in
            color from amber to dark brown depending on age and composition. It typically accumulates in crevices and low-lying
            areas, forming a sticky or hardened layer. The coverage pattern is often uneven, with thicker deposits near the
            source of contamination or in areas where gravity pulls the oil.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: point source spreading (around lubrication points), drip marks
            (on vertical surfaces), edge accumulation (due to surface tension), and uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces).
            The specific pattern depends heavily on the source of the oil, the orientation of the stoneware surface, and the
            environmental conditions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil tends
            to creep along the edges, creating a darker, thicker line. This effect is more pronounced on rough or porous stoneware
            surfaces. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension. It pools on flat areas
            due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces, following the contours of the stoneware. Edges act as barriers,
            preventing the oil from spreading further. Depressions fill with oil, creating localized concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is a
            common manifestation of gravity's influence. Oil runs down slopes, concentrating at the lowest point.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the darker, more oxidized areas. Aged deposits often have a matte finish, but may
            show a slight iridescence in areas where the film is thin and uniform due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, viscous, and sticky to the touch. Partially Oxidized: Tacky, slightly hardened,
            with a rubbery feel. Aged: Hard, crusty, and brittle, sometimes with a slightly glossy or matte finish depending
            on the degree of oxidation and the presence of particulate matter. Microscopic examination may reveal a granular
            or amorphous structure.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-2 mm or more, especially in
            crevices or drip formations. Varies significantly based on the source and duration of contamination.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces, forming streaks of varying thickness. Pools and
            puddles can form on horizontal surfaces, especially in depressions. Thin films coat most exposed surfaces. Thick
            crusts develop in areas of heavy accumulation, particularly after prolonged exposure. Discrete patches and spots
            occur near lubrication points. Stains penetrate the porous stoneware surface.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically
            concentrated near the source of contamination and in areas where gravity pulls the oil. Uniformity is affected
            by surface roughness, porosity of the stoneware, and air currents.
        stucco:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often light in color. Aged contamination darkens
            significantly, becoming thicker and more opaque. The texture transitions from oily to crusty and hardened. Cracking
            and flaking may occur in heavily contaminated areas. The aged buildup often incorporates dirt and debris, further
            darkening the color and roughening the texture.
          buildup_progression: The buildup progression typically starts as a thin film at contact points or edges within hours.
            Over days, it spreads outward from these points, thickening gradually. After weeks, the oil/grease begins to oxidize
            and harden, forming a crusty layer. Over months, the buildup becomes thicker and darker, incorporating dirt and
            debris. Seasonal variations, such as rain and temperature changes, can affect the rate of buildup and the appearance
            of the contamination.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light tan (#F5E7C6) to amber (#FFBF00). Aged contamination: Dark brown (#3B3838)
            to black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) hues from oxidation of metallic additives. Heavily oxidized
            areas can exhibit a matte, almost chalky, dark grey (#A9A9A9) appearance. Some areas may show a greenish-black
            sheen due to sulfur compounds.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in crevices, along edges, and in areas where
            the stucco surface is rougher. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend
            to accumulate a thicker, more uniform layer of contamination. Point sources of contamination, such as leaking
            machinery, create radial patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at the bottom of vertical surfaces due to gravity-induced
            flow. Edges and corners often have higher concentrations due to surface tension effects. Crevices and rough areas
            accumulate more contamination than smooth, flat surfaces. Sheltered areas may have higher concentrations than
            exposed areas due to reduced weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible film, thickness < 5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, visible
            buildup, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, crusty deposits, significant darkening, thickness 100-500
            μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage, thick, hardened layer, thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on stucco presents as a darkening and discoloration of the surface, ranging
            from light staining to thick, crusty deposits. The color is typically brown or black, with variations depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. The texture ranges from smooth and oily to rough and hardened.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation: Oil/grease collects along edges
            and corners due to surface tension and capillary action. 2) Point source spreading: Contamination radiates outward
            from a leak or spill. 3) Gradient from source: Concentration decreases with distance from the source. 4) Streaky/linear:
            Drip marks and runs down vertical surfaces. 5) Localized concentrations: Buildup in crevices and rough areas.
            6) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution due to inconsistent application or environmental factors.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to spread along the perimeter of the contaminated area. This
            is because the surface energy is lower at the edges, making it energetically favorable for the oil/grease to accumulate
            there.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit
            drip marks. Edges act as barriers, preventing the spread of contamination. Depressions and rough areas trap the
            oil/grease.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Oil/grease pools at the bottom edges of vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces
            accumulate settling contamination. Runs down slopes are common. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets
            or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt. Indoor fluorescent lighting may highlight
            the color differences between fresh and aged contamination. Iridescence is rare but possible in thin films due
            to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as volatile components evaporate. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, the surface hardens and becomes rough,
            forming a crusty or waxy layer. Microscopic examination may reveal crystalline structures from ZDDP breakdown
            products. The surface can also feel gritty due to embedded dust and debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly depending on the source and duration of contamination. Thin films
            can be as thin as 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup ranges from 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup can exceed 1 mm, forming a visible
            crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by oil/grease running down
            the surface. 2) Runs/streaks: Similar to drip marks but often wider and more diffuse. 3) Thin films: A barely
            visible layer of contamination. 4) Thick crusts: Hardened layers of aged contamination. 5) Discrete patches: Isolated
            areas of buildup. 6) Stains: Discoloration of the stucco surface caused by oil/grease penetration. 7) Buildups:
            Accumulation of contamination in specific areas, such as corners or crevices.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, exposure to environmental
            factors (wind, rain), and the nature of the contamination source (point source vs. diffuse source).
        tantalum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens, thickens,
            and becomes more opaque. Aged contamination often exhibits a matte finish and may crack or flake off in areas
            of high stress or temperature cycling. Oxidation products contribute to a darker, more resinous appearance.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks, especially at contact points
            and edges. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward. Starts at edges and moves
            inward, gradually covering the surface. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in sheltered areas. Point sources
            expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or changes in operating
            conditions. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F8DE7E) with iridescent sheen'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-Brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B4513) with darker edges'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3E2723) to Black (#000000) in areas of high heat or oxidation'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Reddish-Brown (#A52A2A) with a matte finish'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, corners, and areas with restricted airflow. On vertical
            surfaces, it forms drip marks and streaks. Flat surfaces tend to collect a more uniform layer, while edges often
            exhibit thicker buildup due to surface tension effects.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically highest in crevices, corners, and areas with restricted airflow.
            Edges and seams often exhibit thicker buildup than flat surfaces. Vertical surfaces show a gradient from top to
            bottom, with thicker accumulation at the bottom due to gravity. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to evaporation
            or removal by airflow.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: A very thick, heavily caked layer that completely covers the tantalum surface. May exhibit cracking
                or flaking.
              thickness: '>500 μm'

              description: A more opaque layer with noticeable buildup in crevices and corners. The tantalum surface is partially
                obscured.

            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Appears as a slight sheen or discoloration.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tantalum typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, darker, and more opaque layer with time. The
            color ranges from light amber to dark brown, often with localized areas of black residue.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from lubrication points), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), uniform coating (on sheltered horizontal surfaces),
            and localized concentrations (in crevices and corners). The specific pattern depends heavily on the application
            and operating conditions.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and reduced airflow. The oil/grease
            tends to wick towards the edges, creating a thicker buildup along the perimeter. Center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, especially on horizontal surfaces. This effect is less pronounced on vertical surfaces,
            where gravity dominates.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Builds up in
            crevices, filling depressions and creating a smooth, contoured surface. Pools on flat areas, forming a thicker
            layer. Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Collects at edges, forming a bead or ridge. Follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the surface.
          gravity_influence: Significant downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in drip marks and streaks.
            Pooling at bottom edges, creating a thicker accumulation. Settling on horizontal surfaces, forming a more uniform
            layer. Runs down slopes, following the path of least resistance. Hanging from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like
            structures in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy or semi-glossy sheen under direct lighting, reflecting light
            specularly. As it ages and oxidizes, the surface becomes more matte and diffuse. Iridescence may be visible in
            thin films due to interference effects. Under UV light, certain additives may fluoresce.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged exposure to heat
            and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty or gummy residue. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter
            embedded within the grease matrix. Feels slippery when fresh, increasingly rough and abrasive as it degrades.
          thickness_range: Ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5 mm) for heavy
            buildup. Heavily caked areas can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (caused by gravity), pools/puddles (on horizontal
            surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged and oxidized grease), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform
            coatings (sheltered areas), buildups (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is rare, typically only observed on sheltered horizontal
            surfaces with minimal disturbance. The presence of moving parts, temperature gradients, and airflow patterns contribute
            to non-uniform distribution. Expect significant variations in thickness and composition across the surface.
        teak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often with a noticeable oily sheen. Over time
            (days to weeks), the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darkening of color and a change in texture from
            slick to sticky. Months to years of exposure result in a thick, hardened layer that is often difficult to remove.
            The aged buildup may also exhibit cracking or crazing due to thermal expansion and contraction.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin, almost invisible film, often originating at contact points or
            leak sources. It then spreads outward, either uniformly or in a streaky pattern, depending on the surface texture
            and airflow. Over time (days), the film thickens and becomes more visible. Edges tend to accumulate more oil than
            the center. Months of exposure lead to a hardened, crusty layer. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, leading to layering effects.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, similar to raw honey (#F0C808) with a slight sheen.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Darker amber to light brown, resembling maple syrup (#C4A484).'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish undertones, like burnt sienna (#E97451).'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black, with a matte finish (#301E1E).'
          - 'Oxidized/Dried: Mottled dark brown and black, with possible iridescent sheen in thin layers due to oil oxidation.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling
            in low-lying areas, accumulation along edges and corners, and spreading from point sources (e.g., leaking fittings).
            Crevices and grain lines act as channels for the oil to flow and accumulate.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom surfaces tend to have heavier buildup due to gravity. Crevices and grain lines act as traps for oil and
            grease. Vertical surfaces exhibit a gradient from top to bottom, with higher concentrations at the bottom due
            to dripping. Sheltered areas may accumulate more dust and debris within the grease matrix, leading to higher overall
            contamination levels.

              thickness: 1-5 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on teak presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from subtle amber hues to dark brown or black. The texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible film
            to a thick, sticky, or even crusty layer, depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. Coverage
            patterns are often uneven, with accumulation in crevices, along edges, and in areas where dripping or pooling
            occurs.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation (oil wicks to edges due to surface
            tension). 2) Point source spreading (radial pattern from a leak). 3) Drip marks (vertical streaks from overhead
            sources). 4) Pooling in low-lying areas (gravity-driven accumulation). 5) Patchy/spotty distribution (uneven application
            or localized contamination).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil wicks to the edges, creating a darker and thicker deposit along the perimeter. While the center may also
            be contaminated, the concentration is typically lower than at the edges. This is due to the oil spreading outward
            from a source and being constrained by the edge.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. Flat
            areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces promote dripping. Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading
            further. Depressions fill with oil, creating thicker deposits. The oil follows contours, creating visible flow
            patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Horizontal surfaces
            experience settling of dust and debris within the grease matrix. Runs down slopes are observed. Oil can hang from
            overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and reflects light specularly.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the discoloration and unevenness of the buildup. Aged, oxidized
            deposits have a matte finish and absorb more light. Thin films may exhibit iridescence due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup feels slick and oily to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes sticky
            and tacky. With prolonged exposure and heavy contamination, it can form a hard, crusty layer. The teak grain may
            still be visible through thinner layers, but thicker deposits obscure the wood's natural texture. Microscopic
            examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies significantly. A thin film can be as little as 1-5 μm. Moderate buildup ranges
            from 25-100 μm. Heavy, aged deposits can reach thicknesses of 0.5-2 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (elongated streaks). 2) Runs/streaks (linear flow
            patterns). 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation in depressions). 4) Thin films (uniform coating). 5) Thick crusts (hardened
            deposits). 6) Discrete patches (localized areas of contamination). 7) Stains (discoloration of the wood).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, gravity, airflow, and the
            location of contamination sources. Areas near leaks or drips will have significantly higher concentrations than
            areas further away.
        tempered glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Over time (weeks
            to months), the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, leading to a darkening of the color to brown or black. The texture
            changes from oily to sticky and eventually to a hard, crusty deposit. Thickness increases with continued exposure,
            and dust/debris becomes embedded in the grease.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin, almost invisible film (hours). 2) Begins
            at contact points or leak sources, then spreads outwards (days). 3) Accumulation at edges and corners becomes
            noticeable (days). 4) Thickening of the film occurs, leading to increased opacity (weeks). 5) Oxidation and polymerization
            result in darkening and hardening of the deposit (months). 6) Layering effects occur as new oil deposits on top
            of existing layers (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup.'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#FDD966) with a slight yellow tint'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#C49102), more opaque'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B4513), with darker edges'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3E2723) to Black (#000000) in thick deposits'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-Orange (#B7410E) mixed with dark brown, especially in areas exposed to heat'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include streaks and drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas,
            and accumulation along edges and corners. Initial buildup often occurs around points of contact or sources of
            leakage, spreading outwards from these points. A thin, uniform film may initially form, followed by localized
            thickening in specific areas.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly across the surface. Edges and corners tend to have
            heavier concentrations due to surface tension and capillary action. Bottom edges of vertical surfaces accumulate
            drips. Crevices and low-lying areas collect pooled oil. Flat horizontal surfaces accumulate more than vertical
            surfaces due to settling. Sheltered areas may have higher concentrations than exposed areas due to reduced evaporation.

              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tempered glass typically presents as a translucent to opaque film,
            ranging in color from light amber to dark brown. The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky
            and crusty as it ages, often exhibiting uneven coverage patterns due to gravity and surface irregularities.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually only with very light
            contamination), 2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension and capillary action), 3) Point source spreading
            (oil leaking from a specific point), 4) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source),
            5) Patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to variations in surface cleanliness or exposure), 6) Streaky/linear
            (drip marks on vertical surfaces), 7) Localized concentrations (pooling in low spots).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil tends to flow towards the edges and corners, creating a thicker deposit in these areas.
            While a thin film may cover the entire surface, the edges will typically exhibit a higher concentration.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming a bead. It follows contours, conforming
            to the shape of the surface. It can bridge gaps, forming a continuous layer across small openings. It fills depressions,
            creating a smooth surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks
            on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is a common pattern.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes are observed. Oil can hang
            from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            more opaque, the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Iridescence or rainbow effects can sometimes
            be observed in thin films due to interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of
            the coating.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup feels oily and slippery. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. With further aging
            and oxidation, it hardens into a crusty, sometimes slightly granular texture. Microscopic examination may reveal
            particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can range from smooth to slightly rough depending
            on the presence of contaminants and oxidation products.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or greater, especially in
            areas with prolonged exposure.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks), 2) Runs/streaks (similar to drip
            marks but less defined), 3) Pools/puddles (accumulations in low spots), 4) Thin films (initial layer of contamination),
            5) Thick crusts (hardened, aged deposits), 6) Discrete patches (isolated areas of contamination), 7) Spots/dots
            (small, localized deposits), 8) Stains (discoloration of the glass surface), 9) Uniform coatings (rare, thin layer),
            10) Buildups (thick accumulations in specific areas).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. A perfectly uniform
            coating is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the source of the contamination, the surface cleanliness,
            and environmental factors. Variations in surface energy and airflow patterns contribute to non-uniform distribution.
        terbium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination is a thin, almost invisible film with a slight sheen. Over time, it darkens
            and thickens, becoming more viscous and sticky. Aged contamination often exhibits a matte finish and may contain
            hardened deposits or crusts. Oxidation and polymerization contribute to the darkening and hardening.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin, almost invisible film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and
            darkens, becoming more noticeable. Begins at contact points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is rare; point sources that expand outward are more common. Layering effects occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Iridescent, near-transparent with slight yellow tint (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Light brown, resembling amber (#A67B5B)'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Dark brown, approaching burnt umber (#8A3324)'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Black, often with a matte finish (#000000)'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Exposed: Reddish-brown, similar to rust (#B7410E)'
          common_patterns: Accumulates preferentially in crevices, corners, and areas with restricted airflow. Initially forms
            a thin film, then thickens in localized spots. Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Flat surfaces
            tend to accumulate a more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically higher at edges, corners, and in crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Top surfaces may be cleaner due to gravity washing away contaminants. Vertical walls exhibit
            drip marks and streaks, leading to higher concentrations at the bottom. Exposed areas may be cleaner due to airflow
            and wiping.
          coverage_ranges:

              description: Barely visible, faint sheen. Isolated spots or streaks.
              thickness: <5 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Terbium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, tacky layer with a dark brown to black coloration.
            Coverage varies significantly depending on exposure and geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application
            or wear), streaky/linear (from flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary action. The oil/grease
            tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas. This is especially pronounced
            in corners and along seams.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas.
            Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface
            tension. Follows contours of the surface. Fills depressions, creating thicker deposits.
          gravity_influence: Significant downward flow behavior on vertical surfaces, resulting in pooling at bottom edges
            and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling on horizontal surfaces leads to thicker,
            more uniform deposits. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient of contamination. Hangs from overhead surfaces, forming
            drips.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or iridescence under direct lighting. As it ages and
            thickens, the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Under direct sunlight, aged deposits may appear
            almost black. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker tones.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. With further aging and oxidation,
            it can develop a crusty or gummy texture. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter and oxidation
            byproducts. Feels slippery when fresh, then increasingly adhesive.
          thickness_range: Varies from a monomolecular film (<1 μm) to heavy buildup exceeding 1 mm. Typical range for noticeable
            contamination is 25-500 μm. Extreme buildup in sheltered areas can reach several millimeters.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, oxidized deposits), discrete patches (uneven application),
            spots/dots (splatter or localized leaks), stains (penetration into porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare, typically
            from forced lubrication), buildups (in corners and crevices).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. Uniformity depends heavily on the application method and operating
            conditions. Forced lubrication systems may produce more uniform coatings initially, but wear and gravity quickly
            introduce irregularities. Areas near lubrication points are typically more heavily contaminated.
        terracotta:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming thicker and more viscous. The surface loses its gloss and may develop a matte
            or even cracked appearance. Hardening and crust formation are typical.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film that gradually thickens over time. It often begins
            at contact points with machinery or other sources of contamination and then spreads outward. Accumulation may
            start at edges and move inward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and hardening. Timeframe: Hours (thin film), Days (visible
            discoloration), Months (thickening and hardening).'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) to honey-colored (#E9AB17). Aged contamination: Dark
            brown (#654321) to almost black (#000000) with reddish-brown undertones (#A52A2A) due to oxidation. Heavily contaminated
            areas can exhibit a tar-like black color.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in low-lying areas, crevices, and along edges.
            Drip marks and streaks are common on vertical surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform
            layer of contamination. Point sources of leakage or spillage result in localized concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier along edges and in crevices where the oil/grease can
            accumulate due to surface tension and capillary action. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination sources will
            be heavier than sheltered areas. Vertical walls will exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity-induced
            flow.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible discoloration, thickness < 1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration, thin film, thickness 1-10 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration,
            visible film, thickness 10-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick coating, dark color, thickness 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme
            (>85%): Very thick, crusty buildup, significant alteration of surface appearance, thickness > 1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on terracotta presents as a darkening and discoloration of the surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to thick, viscous coatings. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown or black
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. The texture varies from a thin, almost imperceptible
            film to a thick, sticky, or even hardened crust.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (radial pattern), drip marks (vertical streaks), uniform coating (on horizontal surfaces), and
            localized concentrations (around joints or leaks). The specific pattern depends heavily on the source and method
            of contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band. This
            effect is particularly noticeable on terracotta tiles or bricks.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. Flat areas tend to pool the contaminant. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges
            act as collection points. Depressions fill with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are common. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets or stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish. In indoor fluorescent lighting, the color appears less vibrant and more muted. Thick
            layers can cast shadows, highlighting the uneven surface.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky
            as the volatile components evaporate. With prolonged exposure and oxidation, the surface can harden into a crusty
            or gummy layer. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.5-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or greater.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (irregular flow patterns),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, hardened buildup),
            discrete patches (localized spills), and stains (penetrated into the terracotta).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Variations are caused by differences in surface roughness, exposure to the contaminant source,
            and the effects of gravity and weathering.
        thermoplastic elastomer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time (weeks to months), oxidation darkens
            the color and increases viscosity. Dust and debris adhere to the sticky surface, further darkening the appearance.
            After years, the buildup can become a hard, brittle crust, potentially cracking or flaking off.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks as more oil accumulates
            and oxidation occurs. It often begins at contact points or edges and then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is less common than point sources expanding outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated applications of
            lubricant. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F0C808) to honey-colored (#E4D00A). Aged contamination: Dark
            amber (#795548) to burnt umber (#8A3324) with possible blackening (#000000) due to oxidation and thermal degradation.
            Heavily oxidized areas may exhibit a reddish-brown hue similar to rust (#B7410E).'
          common_patterns: The distribution is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate in low-energy areas such as crevices,
            corners, and edges. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. On horizontal surfaces, pooling can occur. Contact
            points with other components often show higher concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces often have higher concentrations due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas
            accumulate more debris and oil. Flat horizontal surfaces may exhibit pooling. Vertical walls show drip marks with
            higher concentration at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible, thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible discoloration, thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration
            with a sticky texture, thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark coating with significant buildup, thickness
            100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, potentially obscuring the original surface, thickness >
            500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) surfaces typically presents as a discolored,
            often sticky or tacky layer. The color ranges from light amber to dark brown, depending on age and composition.
            Coverage varies from sparse spotting to a thick, nearly complete coating, often concentrated in crevices and low
            points.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (from wiping or flow), localized concentrations (around seals or
            bearings), and drip marks (on vertical surfaces). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to wick along the perimeter of the TPE component. This is especially pronounced in areas where the
            TPE is in contact with other materials. The mechanism is driven by the minimization of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, and drips on vertical surfaces. It collects
            at edges due to surface tension and follows contours. Depressions fill with oil and debris.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident on vertical surfaces,
            resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles
            on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers. Runs down slopes are observed. Oil can hang from overhead surfaces,
            forming droplets.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a glossy sheen under direct lighting. As the oil oxidizes and becomes
            thicker, the sheen diminishes, transitioning to a matte finish. Under certain angles and lighting conditions,
            a slight iridescence may be visible due to thin-film interference effects, especially with fresh, thin layers.
            Direct sunlight accelerates oxidation and darkening.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is oily and smooth, becoming sticky and tacky as oxidation progresses. With
            age, it can become crusty, hardened, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal a fine particulate
            structure from wear debris and additive breakdown products. The surface can feel slightly rough due to accumulated
            dirt and debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.1-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 5 mm or more in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from flow), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination), discrete patches
            (uneven wear), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the TPE surface), and buildups (around joints or
            seals).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface energy, localized wear, uneven application
            of lubricant, and gravitational effects.
        tile:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, oily film with a light brown or amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker (dark brown to black), and more solid. It may develop
            a crusty or cracked surface due to oxidation and polymerization. The aged material is significantly harder to
            remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) that gradually thickens over time (days/weeks).
            It often begins at contact points (e.g., around machinery) and then spreads outward. Accumulation may start at
            edges and then move inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in areas with consistent oil mist. Point
            sources (leaks) expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur due to repeated contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination can appear as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As it
            ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a dark brown (#4E342E) and eventually to a near-black (#212121). In areas with
            high sulfur content, a greenish-black iridescent sheen may be present. Areas exposed to high temperatures may
            exhibit a burnt sienna (#B7410E) hue due to thermal degradation.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and corners. Splatter patterns are also common near machinery. A thin, uniform film may cover large
            areas, especially in enclosed spaces with oil mist.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension effects.
            Bottom areas of vertical surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying areas trap oil/grease.
            Flat horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more than vertical surfaces. Sheltered areas accumulate more due to
            reduced cleaning and environmental exposure.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often appearing as a slight sheen. Thickness:
            <5 μm. Light (10-30%): Visible film, light brown or amber color. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating, dark brown color. Thickness: 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, dark brown to black coating, potentially
            crusty. Thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, black, crusty buildup, potentially several millimeters
            thick. Thickness: >1 mm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tile presents as a viscous, often dark-colored coating that ranges
            from a thin sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically dark brown or black, with variations depending
            on the oil type and age. Coverage patterns are highly variable, ranging from uniform films to localized accumulations,
            often influenced by surface geometry and gravity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in areas exposed to oil mist), edge
            accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading (around leaks), gradient from source (decreasing
            thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent application or cleaning), streaky/linear (due to
            dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating equipment).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edges of the tile, creating a thicker layer compared to the center. This is
            especially noticeable on smooth, non-porous tiles. In some cases, the center may appear relatively clean while
            the edges are heavily contaminated.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            surface tension. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It
            drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours of
            the tile surface. It may bridge small gaps between tiles. It fills depressions and imperfections in the tile surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common on vertical surfaces. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Oil/grease may hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that
            eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and becomes more oxidized,
            the sheen diminishes, and the surface becomes more matte. Under fluorescent lighting, the color appears less saturated.
            Iridescence may be visible in areas with thin films or specific chemical compositions (e.g., sulfurized additives).
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry. With
            age and oxidation, it becomes hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle. At high magnification (SEM), particulate matter
            and wear debris (metal flakes, ZDDP remnants) may be visible embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can
            be smooth or rough depending on the tile texture and the presence of particulate contaminants.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several centimeters (1-3 cm) in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (on large surfaces), thick crusts (due to aging and oxidation),
            discrete patches (due to localized spills), spots/dots (due to splatter), stains (penetrated into porous tile),
            uniform coatings (due to oil mist), buildups (at joints and corners), and, rarely, crystalline structures (from
            specific additives under specific conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare, occurring only in controlled
            environments with consistent oil mist exposure. Mostly uniform distribution with minor variations is more common.
            Moderately patchy and highly variable/irregular distributions are typical in areas with inconsistent cleaning
            or localized leaks. Concentration is often highest near the source of contamination.
        tin:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, light-colored film with a glossy sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes darker, thicker, and more matte in appearance. Oxidation and polymerization
            reactions lead to the formation of hard, crusty deposits that are more difficult to remove. The surface may exhibit
            cracking or crazing.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or areas of high friction, then spreads outwards. Buildup can also start at edges and
            move inward. The accumulation can be gradual and uniform, or it can occur from point sources that expand outward.
            Layering effects can be observed, with new contamination depositing on top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can influence the rate of buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F0E68C)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C4A484)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish undertones (#A0785A)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black (#301E1E) with possible iridescent sheen'
          - 'Oxidized/Burned: Burnt sienna (#B7410E) to dark reddish-brown (#8B4513)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Initial buildup often occurs at points of contact or areas of high friction. Over time,
            the contamination can spread outwards from these initial points, forming a more uniform coating or localized concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Bottom surfaces often exhibit heavier buildup due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered areas accumulate
            more contamination than exposed areas. Vertical walls show drip marks, while horizontal surfaces exhibit pooling.

              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tin typically presents as a viscous, brownish coating that can range
            from a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color is usually dark, with variations depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage patterns are often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface
            geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare), edge accumulation (common),
            point source spreading (common around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance),
            patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized leaks), streaky/linear (due to wiping or dripping), localized
            concentrations (in crevices or corners), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to wick along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas.
            This effect is more pronounced on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners due to
            capillary action. It builds up in crevices, providing a sheltered environment. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the surface. It can bridge gaps, forming a continuous layer across discontinuities.
            It fills depressions, creating a smooth surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. It causes downward flow behavior,
            leading to pooling at bottom edges. Drip marks form from top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking
            is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, creating a thicker layer. It runs down slopes, following
            the path of least resistance. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease buildup exhibits a glossy sheen, reflecting light. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the unevenness of the coating and reveal subtle color variations. Heavily oxidized
            deposits may have a matte finish or exhibit a slight iridescence due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Fresh buildup is typically smooth and oily to the touch, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages.
            With further aging and oxidation, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination
            may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific contaminants and oxidation products. It
            can range from a viscous liquid to a semi-solid or solid.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more, especially in areas of high
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged contamination),
            discrete patches (localized leaks), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the tin surface), uniform coatings
            (rare), buildups (at joints or seams), and potentially crystalline structures (from additives).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the application method and operating conditions. It
            is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare. The level
            of uniformity is influenced by factors such as surface roughness, temperature gradients, and the presence of contaminants.
        titanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, light-colored film. Over time (weeks to months), it darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of debris. The texture changes from oily to sticky and eventually hardens.
            Thickness increases with continued exposure, forming a thicker, more visible layer. Very old deposits (years)
            can become brittle and crack.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours). It then thickens over days/weeks, especially
            at contact points and edges. Spreading occurs from these initial points. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible
            but less common. Point sources expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or contamination
            events. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect viscosity and flow, influencing the buildup rate.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown with reddish hues (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black (#301900)'
          - 'Oxidized: Black with a slight greenish tinge (#0A0A0A)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. Areas near moving
            parts or lubrication points tend to have heavier concentrations.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and near lubrication points.
            Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, with
            heavier concentrations at the bottom. Sheltered areas may accumulate more debris than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, heavy buildup. Thickness: >500 μm (up to several mm).'
              visual: Black, hardened crust, significant alteration of surface appearance.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark layer with significant buildup. Thickness: 100-500 μm.'
              visual: Dark brown to black, crusty texture, significant accumulation.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with noticeable discoloration. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual: Light amber or yellowish tint, patchy coverage.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Visible layer with distinct color. Thickness: 25-100 μm.'
              visual: Medium brown, uneven distribution, drip marks may be present.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Barely visible sheen or scattered spots. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual: Almost invisible, slight discoloration.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on titanium typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a barely visible sheen to a thick, dark residue. The color varies from light amber to dark brown/black depending
            on age and oxidation, with a generally sticky or tacky texture. Coverage patterns are often localized, following
            gravity and surface contours.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), localized concentrations (near
            moving parts), and patchy/spotty coverage (due to uneven application or wear). Uniform coating is rare unless
            intentionally applied.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The liquid tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer there. Center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces. However, point sources in the center can create localized concentrations.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces. Edges act
            as collection points. Depressions fill with the contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes
            are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, especially with thicker, more viscous grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations and uneven
            distribution. Rainbow effects (iridescence) can sometimes be observed in thin films due to interference.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky, eventually hardening
            into a crusty or gummy residue. Close inspection may reveal fine particulate matter embedded within the grease,
            especially near wear points. The surface can feel slightly rough due to the uneven distribution and oxidation
            products.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (due to flow), pools/puddles
            (in low-lying areas), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), and stains (penetration into porous surfaces).
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is uncommon. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, lubrication points,
            wear patterns, and the influence of gravity.
        titanium alloy (ti-6al-4v):
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh contamination (hours/days): Thin, transparent film with a slight sheen, light amber color.
            Aged contamination (months/years): Darker, thicker, and more opaque. Color shifts towards dark brown or black.
            Texture becomes more crusty and less oily. Oxidation products contribute to a reddish-brown or rust-orange hue,
            especially in high-temperature environments. Thickness increases significantly.'
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). Begins at contact points
            (e.g., lubrication fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often gradual and uniform initially, but becomes
            more localized and uneven as the oil degrades and oxidizes (months). Layering effects can occur with repeated
            applications of oil or grease. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup
            and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Light amber (#F5DEB3) with iridescent sheen. Slightly aged: Yellowish-brown
            (#C4A484). Moderately aged: Medium brown (#A0785A). Heavily aged: Dark brown (#654321) with blackish edges (#000000).
            Oxidized/Heat-affected: Rust-orange (#B7410E) to reddish-brown (#8B4513).'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and streaks are common, especially near lubrication points or areas of mechanical
            contact. Accumulation occurs in crevices, edges, and areas where oil can pool. Drip marks are observed on vertical
            surfaces. A thin, uniform coating may be present in areas exposed to oil mist or splash.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to capillary action
            and gravity. Top surfaces may have lighter contamination due to runoff, while bottom surfaces accumulate drips
            and pools. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to cleaning or evaporation, while sheltered areas accumulate
            more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Barely visible sheen, 1-5 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy film,
            5-25 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Visible coating with some areas of thicker buildup, 25-50 μm thickness.
            Heavy (60-85%): Opaque coating with significant buildup, 50-200 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Thick, crusty layer
            with extensive buildup, >200 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Ti-6Al-4V typically presents as a patchy, iridescent film that darkens
            and thickens over time. Initially, it appears as a thin, almost invisible sheen, progressing to a visible, colored
            layer with varying degrees of tackiness and localized accumulation. The color ranges from light amber to dark
            brown, often with a rainbow-like sheen in thinner areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading (around lubrication fittings), streaky/linear
            (along sliding surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices and corners), and patchy/spotty (due to uneven
            application or removal). A gradient from source is often observed, with the thickest buildup closest to the source
            of contamination.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to capillary action and surface tension.
            The oil tends to wick towards edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center areas. This is especially
            pronounced in areas with sharp corners or narrow gaps.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action. Pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows contours of the surface.
            Fills depressions and low spots. Bridges gaps between closely spaced surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs
            on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, especially with viscous
            greases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the oil film exhibits a noticeable sheen and iridescence, especially when
            thin. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the true color of the oil, which can range from light amber to dark
            brown. Heavily oxidized areas may appear matte. The iridescence is due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: Initially, a slick, oily feel. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky. With prolonged exposure
            and oxidation, it can become crusty and hard. Close inspection may reveal a slightly granular or particulate texture
            due to the presence of additives and wear debris. Surface can be smooth when a thin film, or rough when built
            up.
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-100 μm. Heavy buildup: 100-500 μm. Extreme buildup: >500
            μm, potentially reaching several millimeters in extreme cases.'
          typical_formations: 'Common formations include: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (along sliding surfaces),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (on broad surfaces), thick crusts (in areas of heavy oxidation),
            discrete patches (due to localized contamination), and stains (where oil has penetrated porous surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically
            concentrated in specific areas, such as lubrication points, wear zones, and low-lying areas where oil can pool.
            Uniformity depends heavily on the application method and operating conditions.
        titanium carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a light amber color. Aged contamination
            darkens significantly, becoming opaque and thicker. The texture changes from smooth to sticky and eventually to
            a hard, crusty residue. Oxidation products contribute to a darker, almost black appearance.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure. Over days, it thickens and spreads
            from contact points. Edges accumulate buildup faster than central areas. Over months, layering effects become
            visible as new oil/grease deposits on top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber (#F0C808) with a slight green tint from additives.'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Dark amber (#D4A017) with increased brown hues.'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Burnt Sienna (#B7410E) with reddish-brown tones.'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#4A3000) almost black in thick areas.'
          - 'Oxidized: Black (#000000) with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: The buildup commonly forms localized spots and streaks, especially near lubrication points or areas
            of high friction. It tends to accumulate along edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due to gravity.
            A gradient of thickness is often observed, with thicker deposits closer to the source of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Horizontal surfaces accumulate more buildup than vertical surfaces due to gravity. Sheltered
            areas often have higher concentrations than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, encrusted coating. Thickness: >300 μm.'
              visual: Completely covered in a thick, dark, crusty layer.

              description: 'Thick coating with minimal bare metal. Thickness: 100-300 μm.'
              visual: Dark, thick coating almost completely covering the surface.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin film with some visible streaks and spots. Thickness: 5-25 μm.'
              visual: Slightly darkened surface, visible streaks and spots.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%

              visual: Darkened surface with visible coating, some bare metal showing.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm.'
              visual: Barely perceptible sheen, isolated dark spots.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on titanium carbide typically presents as a dark, viscous coating that
            ranges in color from amber to dark brown, often with a slightly iridescent sheen. The buildup tends to accumulate
            in crevices and low-lying areas, forming a sticky, uneven layer.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication fittings), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or removal), streaky/linear (flow along surfaces), localized concentrations (in crevices),
            and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' along the edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas.
            This is especially noticeable on sharp edges and corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Buildup accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Flat areas allow pooling. Vertical surfaces experience dripping.
            Edges act as collection points. Contours guide flow patterns. Depressions fill with contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease can
            hang from overhead surfaces, eventually dripping.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte. Iridescence can be observed in thin films due to interference effects. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of buildup.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky due to oxidation
            and polymerization. With prolonged exposure and heat cycling, it can harden into a crusty or gummy residue. Microscopic
            examination reveals a non-uniform surface with varying degrees of smoothness and roughness. It feels slippery
            when fresh, but becomes increasingly adhesive as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness varies from a thin film (1-5 μm) to heavy buildup (up to 500 μm or more) depending on
            the duration and intensity of exposure. In extreme cases, buildup can reach several millimeters in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), and buildups (accumulation
            over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface finish, temperature gradients, flow
            patterns, and the presence of contaminants.
        titanium nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, oily film with a dark, reflective sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker, and more viscous. It may harden into a crusty or
            tar-like deposit, often with a matte finish. The color shifts from dark brown to black, and the surface may exhibit
            cracks or fissures.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or lubrication points and then spreads outward. In some cases, it starts at edges and
            moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in enclosed systems. Point sources expand outward, creating
            radial patterns. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination often appears as a thin, iridescent film with colors ranging from #36454F
            (charcoal) to #808000 (olive), sometimes exhibiting a rainbow sheen due to thin-film interference. As it ages
            and oxidizes, it darkens to #654321 (dark brown), then to #000000 (black). Heavily oxidized deposits can exhibit
            a matte, reddish-brown hue (#A0522D, Sienna) due to iron oxide contamination from wear debris.'
          common_patterns: The distribution pattern is highly dependent on the application and operating conditions. Common
            patterns include localized spots around lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing, and uniform coatings
            in enclosed environments. Accumulation is often observed in crevices, edges, and areas with poor ventilation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup due to gravity, while bottom surfaces may accumulate more
            due to dripping. Corners and sheltered areas often have higher concentrations due to reduced airflow and evaporation.
            Flat surfaces may have a more uniform coating, while vertical walls may exhibit drip marks.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, often with iridescent colors. Thickness: <100
            nm. Light (10-30%): Thin, oily film with visible dark spots or streaks. Thickness: 100 nm - 1 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            Noticeable dark coating with some areas of bare metal still visible. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick,
            dark coating covering most of the surface. Thickness: 10-100 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, tar-like deposit
            completely obscuring the underlying surface. Thickness: >100 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Titanium Nitride typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color is usually dark brown to black, with variations
            depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. Coverage can range from sparse spotting to complete surface
            encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (in enclosed systems with oil
            mist lubrication), 2) Edge accumulation (due to surface tension and capillary action), 3) Point source spreading
            (around lubrication points), 4) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source), 5)
            Patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or localized contamination), 6) Streaky/linear (due to dripping or splashing),
            7) Localized concentrations (in crevices or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to spread along the perimeter of the surface, creating a thicker coating at
            the edges compared to the center. This is because the surface energy is minimized when the oil wets the edges.
            In some cases, the center may have a thinner, more uniform film, while the edges have a thicker, more concentrated
            deposit.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and builds up
            in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas and drips on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension and follows contours. It can bridge gaps and fill
            depressions. The physical reasons are related to surface energy minimization and fluid dynamics.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common. Oil settles
            on horizontal surfaces and runs down slopes. It can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually
            drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh contamination may exhibit a rainbow sheen due to thin-film interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the dark, oily nature of the deposit. Aged contamination typically
            has a matte finish and does not reflect light as readily. The presence of metallic wear debris can create a subtle
            metallic sheen.
          texture_details: Fresh contamination is typically smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and
            viscous. With prolonged exposure to heat and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty, tar-like substance. Microscopic
            examination may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific additives and oxidation products
            present. The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte when aged and oxidized.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few nanometers (thin film) to several millimeters (heavy buildup). A thin
            film might be 10-100 nm, while a heavy buildup can reach 0.5-5 mm or more, depending on the severity of the contamination.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), 2) Runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            3) Pools/puddles (in low points), 4) Thin films (on lightly contaminated surfaces), 5) Thick crusts (on heavily
            contaminated surfaces), 6) Discrete patches (due to localized contamination), 7) Spots/dots (due to splashing
            or oil mist), 8) Stains (on porous surfaces), 9) Uniform coatings (in enclosed systems), 10) Buildups (in crevices
            or corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare, typically only seen in
            controlled laboratory settings. Mostly uniform with minor variations is possible in enclosed systems with oil
            mist. Moderately patchy is common in most industrial applications. Highly variable/irregular is typical in areas
            with direct exposure to splashing or dripping. Concentration in specific areas is common in crevices or low points.
            The uniformity level is primarily determined by the method of oil application and the operating environment.
        tool steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Over time, it darkens, thickens, and becomes
            more viscous. Aged contamination often exhibits a matte finish due to oxidation and the accumulation of particulate
            matter. It can also develop a hard, crusty surface layer.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, often at contact points or lubrication fittings.
            It then spreads outward, thickening over time. Edges tend to accumulate oil/grease faster than center areas. Layering
            effects can occur as new oil/grease is applied over existing buildup. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity
            can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization, influencing the appearance and texture. Timeframes: Hours
            (thin film), Days (visible streaks), Weeks (thickening), Months (crust formation).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent with iridescent sheen (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Slightly Aged (days): Yellowish-brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged (weeks): Dark brown with reddish undertones (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged (months): Black, often with a matte finish (#000000)'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Affected: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) with localized black carbon deposits'
          common_patterns: Buildup commonly occurs in localized spots near lubrication points, streaks along moving parts,
            and drip marks on vertical surfaces. It accumulates in crevices, corners, and around fasteners. Flat surfaces
            tend to have a more uniform coating, while vertical surfaces exhibit runs and drips.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier near lubrication points, edges, and in crevices. Top
            surfaces exposed to direct contamination often have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Vertical walls
            exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity-induced flow. Corners and crevices act as collection points,
            leading to significant buildup.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'A very thick, crusty coating with complete coverage and significant buildup. Thickness: >1 mm.
                Color: Black, often with a matte finish.'
              thickness: '>1 mm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%

                100 μm - 1 mm. Color: Dark brown to black.'
              thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'A thin, patchy film with visible streaks and spots. Thickness: 1-10 μm. Color: Light amber to
                yellowish-brown.'
              thickness: 1-10 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'A more continuous coating with some areas of thicker buildup. Thickness: 10-100 μm. Color: Yellowish-brown
                to dark brown.'
              thickness: 10-100 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Thickness: <1 μm. Appears as a slight sheen
                under certain lighting conditions.'
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tool steel presents as a viscous coating, ranging from a thin, iridescent
            film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies significantly based on the oil's composition,
            age, and environmental conditions, often exhibiting a sticky or tacky texture and accumulating in low-lying areas
            or crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on flat, horizontal surfaces. 2)
            Edge accumulation along seams and joints. 3) Point source spreading from lubrication fittings. 4) Streaky/linear
            patterns along sliding surfaces. 5) Localized concentrations in crevices and corners. 6) Drip marks on vertical
            surfaces. The most common patterns are edge accumulation, point source spreading, and drip marks.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface
            tension and capillary action. The oil/grease tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker layer. Center areas
            may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating. Avoidance of edges is not typical.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating runs and streaks. It collects at edges, forming a thicker layer. It follows contours, conforming to the
            shape of the surface. It can bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop
            down slopes. Oil/grease can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach. The rate of
            downward flow depends on the viscosity of the oil/grease and the surface angle.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and can display iridescent
            rainbow effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to flatten the appearance, making
            the color appear more muted and the texture less pronounced. Aged, oxidized grease typically has a matte finish,
            reflecting less light.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With significant
            oxidation and polymerization, it becomes a hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle solid. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter (metal fines, dirt) embedded within the grease matrix. It can feel waxy or even
            slightly abrasive due to embedded debris.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more in areas of severe
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on flat surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in areas of heavy
            accumulation. 3) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 4) Runs/streaks along sliding surfaces. 5) Pools/puddles in
            low-lying areas. 6) Discrete patches around lubrication points. 7) Stains on porous surfaces. The formation mechanism
            is primarily driven by gravity, surface tension, and the flow properties of the oil/grease.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on the application method, operating conditions, and the geometry of
            the tool steel. Areas near lubrication points tend to have higher concentrations, while areas further away may
            have only a thin film.
        travertine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a glossy, dark brown film. Aged contamination (months/years
            old) becomes darker, more matte, and thicker. Oxidation and polymerization lead to a hardened, crusty texture.
            The color shifts towards darker browns and blacks, and the buildup becomes more difficult to remove. Thickness
            increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, typically at contact points or edges, within hours. Over days,
            it spreads outward from these initial points. Over weeks/months, the film thickens due to continued exposure and
            oxidation. Layering effects may occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in temperature and
            humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: #4A3000 (Dark Brown) with an oily sheen; Lightly Aged: #664200 (Medium Brown); Moderately
            Aged: #734A00 (Sienna Brown); Heavily Aged: #332200 (Dark Sepia); Oxidized/Burned: #261A00 (Black-Brown).'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in depressions, and accumulation
            along edges and corners. Point source contamination leads to radial spreading patterns. Crevices and porous areas
            act as reservoirs, concentrating the buildup. Flat surfaces tend to exhibit more uniform, albeit thin, coatings.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and surface
            tension. Crevices and porous areas act as reservoirs, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit
            a gradient from top to bottom due to gravity. Sheltered areas may accumulate more buildup than exposed areas due
            to reduced cleaning or weathering.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, barely visible, 1-10 μm thickness. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            discoloration, thin film, 10-50 μm thickness. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, visible buildup, 50-200
            μm thickness. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive coverage, thick coating, 200-1000 μm thickness. Extreme (>85%): Almost
            complete coverage, very thick buildup, >1000 μm thickness.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on travertine manifests as a darkening and discoloration of the stone,
            ranging from light staining to thick, viscous coatings. The color is typically brown or black, with a greasy or
            oily sheen when fresh, becoming duller and more matte as it ages. Coverage varies from localized spots to extensive
            surface coatings, often concentrated in porous areas and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading (radial pattern from a
            leak); 2) Edge accumulation (along joints and borders); 3) Drip marks (vertical streaks from overhead sources);
            4) Patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to splashing or spills); 5) Uniform coating (less common, but possible
            in areas with constant exposure). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action
            and surface tension. The oil/grease tends to wick along the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band.
            This is especially noticeable around tiles or joints.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. It collects at
            edges due to surface tension. It follows contours and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior results in drip marks and vertical streaking.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common. Oil/grease can hang from
            overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the color variations and surface texture more clearly. Aged contamination tends to have a matte
            finish, reflecting less light. Iridescence may be observed in thin films due to interference effects, especially
            with certain additives.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch, often sticky. Over time, it can become
            rougher as oxidation and polymerization occur, forming a crusty or tacky surface. Travertine's natural porosity
            contributes to a slightly uneven texture, with the oil/grease filling in the pores. Microscopic analysis may reveal
            crystalline structures of ZDDP oxidation products.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach several millimeters in heavily contaminated areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks); 2) Runs/streaks (irregular flow
            patterns); 3) Pools/puddles (accumulation in depressions); 4) Thin films (uniform or patchy coatings); 5) Thick
            crusts (hardened, aged buildup); 6) Discrete patches (localized contamination); 7) Stains (penetration into the
            travertine pores).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface porosity, uneven application of the
            contaminant, and the influence of gravity and surface geometry.
        tungsten:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film, often with a rainbow-like iridescence. Over
            time (days to weeks), it darkens and thickens due to oxidation and polymerization. Aged contamination (months
            to years) becomes a hard, dark, and often cracked crust. The surface may exhibit a matte finish and be covered
            in dust and debris.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: (1) Starts as a thin, iridescent film upon initial contact
            (hours). (2) Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward (days). (3) Accumulates at
            edges and in crevices due to capillary action (days). (4) Thickens and darkens due to oxidation and polymerization
            (weeks). (5) Forms a hard, crusty deposit with prolonged exposure to heat and contaminants (months). (6) May exhibit
            layering effects due to repeated applications or seasonal variations in temperature and humidity (years).'
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Translucent amber (#F0C808) with slight iridescence'
          - 'Lightly Oxidized: Yellow-brown (#A07A44)'
          - 'Moderately Oxidized: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish undertones'
          - 'Heavily Oxidized: Black (#000000) with a matte finish'
          - 'Heat-Aged: Burnt sienna (#B7410E) to dark reddish-brown (#800000)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or splashing,
            and uniform coatings on surfaces exposed to oil mist. Accumulation is often observed in crevices, corners, and
            along edges due to capillary action and gravity. Heat exposure can lead to a baked-on appearance, especially near
            hot surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier buildup due
            to capillary action and reduced airflow. Bottom surfaces accumulate more oil due to gravity. Crevices and sheltered
            areas trap oil and debris. Flat surfaces may have more uniform coverage, while vertical walls exhibit drip marks.
            Exposed areas may experience higher oxidation rates, leading to thicker, darker deposits.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: A very thick, tar-like coating that completely covers the tungsten surface. Significant buildup
                and crusting are present.

            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: A thick, dark coating that largely obscures the tungsten surface. Significant buildup is visible
                in crevices and corners.
              thickness: 100-500 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: A thin, patchy film with visible droplets and streaks. The underlying tungsten surface is still
                clearly visible.
              thickness: 1-10 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: A more continuous film with some areas of thicker buildup. The tungsten surface is partially obscured.
              thickness: 10-100 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Appears as scattered droplets or faint discoloration.
              thickness: <1 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tungsten typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color is initially a translucent amber, darkening
            to shades of brown and black with age and exposure to heat and oxygen. Coverage varies from sparse spotting to
            complete surface encasement, often concentrating in low-lying areas and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in areas exposed to oil mist), edge
            accumulation (due to capillary action), point source spreading (from leaks or lubrication points), gradient from
            source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or splashing), streaky/linear
            (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners). Edge accumulation and point source
            spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to capillary
            action and surface tension effects. The oil tends to wick along edges, creating a thicker deposit compared to
            the center areas. In some cases, a thin film may cover the entire surface, but the edges will always exhibit a
            more pronounced buildup. This is due to the increased surface area and reduced airflow at the edges, promoting
            oil retention and oxidation.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It builds up in crevices and depressions, creating thicker deposits. It pools on flat areas,
            forming puddles or thick films. It drips on vertical surfaces, creating drip marks. It collects at edges, forming
            a raised rim. It follows contours, creating uneven coatings. It bridges gaps, forming solid connections between
            surfaces. It fills depressions, leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and runs. Pooling
            occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common due to oil running down walls.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker deposits. Oil runs down slopes, creating a gradient of
            thickness. Oil hangs from overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like formations. The angle of the
            surface directly impacts the flow rate and accumulation pattern.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit a noticeable sheen and iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals the amber or brown color more clearly. Aged deposits tend to have a matte finish and absorb light,
            appearing darker. The presence of metallic particles from wear can create a slight metallic sheen in some areas.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it oxidizes. With prolonged
            exposure to heat and contaminants, it becomes a hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle deposit. Microscopic examination
            may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific oil composition and aging process. It
            feels greasy when fresh, then becomes increasingly rough and abrasive as it hardens.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.5-5
            mm) for heavy buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more, resembling a thick, tar-like
            coating.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from oil flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (splashes or drips), spots/dots (oil mist), stains (penetrated into porous surfaces), uniform coatings
            (oil mist lubrication), buildups (accumulated over time), and potentially crystalline structures (from additive
            breakdown).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare, occurring only under controlled
            conditions like oil mist lubrication. Mostly uniform distribution with minor variations is common in areas exposed
            to consistent oil spray. Moderately patchy and highly variable/irregular distributions are typical near leaks
            or areas with inconsistent lubrication. Concentration in specific areas (e.g., crevices) is also common. Uniformity
            is affected by application method, surface geometry, temperature gradients, and airflow.
        tungsten carbide:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The surface may develop a crusty
            or hardened texture. Color shifts from amber to dark brown or black. Thickness increases significantly, and the
            buildup becomes more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or lubrication points and then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges and then move
            inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than localized buildup. Point sources expand
            outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects occur as new oil/grease is deposited on top of existing buildup.
            Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Iridescent sheen with light amber (#F0C808) highlights. Lightly Aged: Medium amber (#D4A017)
            to light brown (#A67B5B). Moderately Aged: Dark brown (#654321) with reddish-brown (#800000) undertones. Heavily
            Aged: Black (#000000) with possible grey (#808080) patches due to oxidation and carbonization. Extreme Aging:
            Glossy black (#000000) with possible rust-orange (#B7410E) staining if moisture is present and corrosion of ferrous
            components is occurring nearby.'
          common_patterns: The distribution is highly dependent on the application and environment. Initially, a thin film
            may cover the entire surface. Over time, accumulation occurs at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces
            due to gravity. Splatter patterns and drip marks are common near lubrication points. Areas exposed to high temperatures
            may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Crevices and low points also accumulate more buildup. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with
            heavier concentrations at the bottom. Horizontal surfaces tend to have more uniform coverage but can also accumulate
            pools of oil/grease. Exposed areas may experience some removal due to airflow or cleaning, while sheltered areas
            accumulate more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Thin film with some visible accumulation at edges. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable
            coating with some areas of bare metal. Thickness: 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating covering most
            of the surface. Thickness: 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Complete encasement with a thick, crusty layer. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on tungsten carbide typically presents as a viscous, dark coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, more opaque layer with shades of brown and black.
            Coverage varies from sparse spotting to complete surface encasement, depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with initial application),
            edge accumulation (very common due to surface tension and capillary action), point source spreading (around lubrication
            points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to uneven
            application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in
            crevices or low points), and radial patterns (around rotating components).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and
            capillary action. The oil/grease tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This is especially pronounced in areas with sharp edges or corners. The center areas may have a thinner,
            more uniform film, or may be relatively clean depending on the application.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, filling them completely. It pools on flat areas, creating thicker
            layers. It drips on vertical surfaces, forming streaks. It collects at edges, creating a raised rim. It follows
            contours, conforming to the surface shape. It can bridge gaps, forming a continuous layer across discontinuities.
            It fills depressions, leveling out the surface.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and streaks
            on vertical surfaces. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is a common pattern.
            Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from
            overhead surfaces is possible, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen and can display iridescent
            rainbow effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to subdue the sheen, making the
            color appear darker and more matte. Heavily oxidized buildup appears matte under most lighting conditions. Glossiness
            decreases with age and oxidation.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and tacky.
            With further aging and oxidation, it can become crusty, hard, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination
            may reveal a granular or amorphous structure, depending on the specific oil/grease composition and degradation
            products. The surface can range from glossy to matte depending on the thickness and oxidation level.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or more, resembling
            a thick crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to gravity),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged and oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (localized contamination), spots/dots (splatter or aerosol deposition), stains (penetration into
            porous surfaces), uniform coatings (rare, initial application), buildups (accumulations in specific areas), and
            amorphous structures (microscopic level).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare except immediately after application. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface
            finish, temperature gradients, gravity, and the dynamics of the lubrication process. Areas with higher friction
            or heat tend to accumulate more buildup.
        urethane composites:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, glossy film with a light brown color. Aged
            contamination (months/years) is significantly darker, thicker, and often has a matte or semi-gloss finish. It
            may exhibit cracking or crazing due to drying and oxidation. The aged material is significantly harder to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (1-5 μm) then thickens over time. It often begins at
            contact points or edges then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point
            sources that expand outward. Layering effects can occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and polymerization.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark brown (#654321), and eventually a near-black
            (#222222) with prolonged exposure and heat cycling. Sulfurized additives can impart a greenish-brown hue in some
            cases.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and crevices. Point source contamination often results in radial spreading patterns. Uniform coatings
            are rare, typically only occurring after intentional application (e.g., spraying).
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Top surfaces may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Corners often accumulate
            more than flat surfaces. Sheltered areas may accumulate more than exposed areas due to reduced cleaning action
            from wind or rain.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible, thin film, 1-5 μm. Light (10-30%): noticeable sheen, thin
            coating, 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): distinct brown coloration, easily visible, 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): thick,
            dark coating, potentially tacky, 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): very thick, dark, crusty buildup, 0.5-2 mm or more.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on urethane composites typically presents as a dark, viscous coating,
            ranging from a thin sheen to a thick, tacky layer. The color is usually dark brown to black, with variations depending
            on the oil type and age. Coverage patterns are often uneven, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from leaks or spills), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance), patchy/spotty
            (uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (from wiping or dripping), localized concentrations
            (in crevices or corners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a higher concentration there. This is especially pronounced
            on surfaces with sharp edges or corners.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices due to capillary action and
            reduced cleaning. Pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges
            due to surface tension. Follows contours of the surface. Bridges gaps if the viscosity is high enough. Fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits.
            Runs down slopes, creating streaks. Can hang from overhead surfaces if the viscosity is high enough.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a noticeable sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting tends to highlight the unevenness of the coating. Aged, oxidized buildup often has a matte finish and
            may exhibit slight iridescence due to thin-film interference effects, especially with layered deposits.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With significant
            oxidation and polymerization, it can become crusty and hard. Microscopic examination may reveal a slightly granular
            or amorphous structure. It feels slippery when fresh, becoming increasingly resistant to wiping as it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm (barely visible) to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm (easily
            visible and palpable). Extreme cases can reach 5 mm or more in areas of significant accumulation.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (sloped surfaces),
            pools/puddles (horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (localized spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the urethane), uniform coatings
            (rare, intentional application), buildups (accumulated over time).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless intentionally applied. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness,
            gravity, airflow, and the nature of the contamination source.
        vanadium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) appears as a thin, glossy film, often with an oily sheen.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, darker, and more matte. Oxidation and polymerization cause
            the oil to harden and form a crusty or tar-like deposit. The color shifts from brown to black, and the surface
            may develop cracks or fissures.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically starts as a thin film, then thickens over time. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward. It can start at edges and move inward due to capillary
            action. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward, creating
            radial patterns. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or contamination events. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation. Timeframes: Initial film formation within
            hours, noticeable buildup within days, significant crusting within months, and extreme accumulation within years.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: Iridescent sheen with underlying metallic gray of Vanadium. Light contamination:
            #4A3C30 (Dark Brown), almost transparent. Moderate contamination: #362F2E (Dark Coffee Brown). Aged contamination:
            #211E1E (Black) with possible reddish-brown (#800000) oxidation products at the edges. Heavily oxidized/aged:
            #544B48 (Dark Grayish Brown) with a matte finish.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform coatings on flat surfaces, accumulation in crevices and corners
            due to capillary action and gravity, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and localized spots around lubrication points.
            Edges and areas with restricted airflow tend to accumulate more buildup due to reduced evaporation and increased
            oxidation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and capillary
            action. Top surfaces may have less buildup due to gravity and evaporation, while bottom surfaces accumulate drips
            and pools. Crevices and sheltered areas trap oil and grease, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical walls
            exhibit drip marks, while horizontal surfaces accumulate thicker layers.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, almost invisible film with occasional spots. Thickness: <1 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Visible film with some areas of bare metal. Thickness: 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage
            with a noticeable layer of oil/grease. Thickness: 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating with minimal
            bare metal. Thickness: 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, encrusted layer with significant buildup. Thickness:
            >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Vanadium typically presents as a dark, viscous coating, ranging from
            a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like deposit. The color is usually dark brown or black, with a slightly
            glossy or matte finish depending on the age and thickness of the deposit. Coverage patterns vary from uniform
            coatings to localized accumulations in crevices and low-lying areas.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with controlled application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            and capillary action. The oil tends to creep along the edges, creating a thicker layer compared to the center
            areas. This effect is more pronounced on sharp edges and corners. The mechanism is driven by the minimization
            of surface energy.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to capillary action. It builds up in crevices due to restricted airflow and reduced evaporation. It pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension.
            It follows contours due to viscous flow. It can bridge gaps if the viscosity is high enough. It fills depressions
            due to gravity and surface tension.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common on vertical
            surfaces. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging occurs from overhead surfaces,
            forming stalactite-like formations in extreme cases. The rate of downward flow depends on the viscosity and temperature
            of the oil/grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen and may show iridescent rainbow
            effects due to thin-film interference. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the dark color and matte
            finish of aged deposits. The presence of metallic particles can create a subtle metallic sparkle under bright
            light.
          texture_details: Fresh oil/grease is typically smooth and sticky to the touch. As it ages and oxidizes, it becomes
            more viscous and tacky. With significant buildup, the surface can become rough and crusty, especially if exposed
            to high temperatures or contaminants. At a microscopic level, particulate matter and wear debris may be embedded
            within the grease matrix.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. Extremely aged deposits can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or greater in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete
            patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or fine spray), stains (penetration into porous surfaces),
            uniform coatings (rare), buildups (localized accumulations), and, rarely, crystalline structures (from certain
            additives under specific conditions).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Perfectly uniform is rare. Mostly uniform with minor variations
            is possible on machined surfaces. Moderately patchy is common. Highly variable/irregular is typical in areas with
            complex geometry or uneven lubrication. Concentration is often higher near lubrication points or in areas with
            poor ventilation. The uniformity level is primarily determined by the application method, surface geometry, and
            environmental conditions.
        walnut:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film that enhances the natural grain of the
            walnut. Over time, the oil oxidizes and polymerizes, darkening in color and thickening. Aged contamination is
            characterized by a dark, opaque, and often cracked or crazed surface. Dust and debris become embedded in the aged
            buildup, further dulling the finish.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., around fasteners) then spreads outward. Accumulation can start at edges then move inward. Uniform
            gradual accumulation is possible with consistent exposure. Point sources expand outward over time. Layering effects
            occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations (temperature, humidity) can affect the rate of oxidation
            and polymerization.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, similar to raw honey (#F0C808)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown, like aged varnish (#B8860B)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark brown, resembling burnt umber (#8A3324)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black, with hints of dark brown in thinner areas (#000000)'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-orange, especially if ZDDP is present (#B7410E)'
          common_patterns: The distribution is often uneven, with accumulation in crevices, along edges, and in areas where
            the oil/grease is directly applied or drips. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate more than vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. Splatter patterns and drip marks are common near the source of contamination.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity
            and capillary action. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to surface tension effects. Top
            surfaces exposed to direct contamination sources will be heavier than sheltered areas. Vertical walls will have
            lighter concentrations with drip marks.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: A very thick, crusty or tar-like buildup that completely covers the walnut surface. The original
                material is unrecognizable.
              thickness: '> 500 μm'
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: A thick, glossy or matte coating that completely obscures the walnut grain. The surface may be
                uneven or cracked.
              thickness: 200-500 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: A thin film covering some areas, with noticeable discoloration. The walnut grain is still visible
                but partially obscured.
              thickness: 10-50 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: A more substantial coating, with significant darkening of the walnut. The grain is partially obscured
                or completely hidden in some areas.
              thickness: 50-200 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. The walnut grain is clearly visible and unaffected
                in most areas.
              thickness: < 10 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on walnut presents as a darkening and discoloration of the wood surface,
            ranging from subtle staining to a thick, glossy coating. The color shifts from light amber to dark brown or black
            depending on the age and concentration of the contaminant. The texture varies from a slightly tacky film to a
            hardened, crusty layer.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (oil wicks to edges due to surface tension),
            point source spreading (circular or elliptical patterns radiating from a leak), gradient from source (decreasing
            concentration with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven application or splatter), streaky/linear (drip marks or wiping),
            localized concentrations (pooling in low spots). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. The oil tends to wick towards the edges, creating a darker, more concentrated band along the perimeter.
            This effect is particularly noticeable on flat surfaces and around corners.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. Drips form on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges due to surface tension.
            It follows contours of the wood grain. It may bridge small gaps or fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to
            bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Some
            oil may hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals
            the color variations and uneven distribution more clearly. Aged buildup tends to have a matte finish due to surface
            oxidation and dust accumulation. Iridescence can occur in very thin films due to interference effects, especially
            with certain additives.
          texture_details: Initially, the buildup is a thin, oily film that feels slightly tacky. As it ages and oxidizes,
            it becomes more viscous and sticky. With prolonged exposure and heat, it can harden into a brittle, crusty layer.
            The surface can be smooth and glossy when fresh, but becomes rough and uneven with age due to dust accumulation
            and oxidation.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a monomolecular layer (<< 1 μm) in initial stages to several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) in areas of heavy accumulation. Typical thin films are in the range of 25-100 μm, while heavy buildup
            can reach 0.5-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (angled flow patterns),
            pools/puddles (accumulations on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial coating), thick crusts (aged buildup),
            discrete patches (splatter or localized contamination), spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into
            the wood grain), uniform coatings (rare, intentional application), buildups (layered accumulation). Drip marks
            and thin films are most common initially.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the oil/grease was intentionally applied as a coating. Non-uniformity is caused by
            variations in surface roughness, gravity, application method, and environmental factors.
        willow:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Aged contamination darkens in color, thickens,
            and becomes more viscous. Oxidation leads to the formation of a hard, crusty surface layer. The buildup can become
            quite thick (millimeters) over extended periods.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours) then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., near bearings) then spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges initially. Over months,
            layering effects become visible as new contamination deposits on top of older, oxidized layers. Seasonal variations
            in temperature can affect viscosity and flow rates, influencing the buildup pattern.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, #F0C808 (resembling light machine oil)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-brown, #A07A3D (similar to aged varnish)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown, #6B4F1A (resembling dark honey)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to almost black, #301E00 (like dried tar)'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-tinged brown, #8B4513 (due to iron oxide contamination)'
          common_patterns: Distribution is rarely uniform. Oil/grease tends to accumulate in crevices, along edges, and on
            horizontal surfaces due to gravity. Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Initial contamination often starts
            at points of contact with machinery or other sources.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity.
            Edges tend to accumulate more oil/grease due to surface tension effects. Top surfaces exposed to direct contamination
            sources will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Vertical walls will show a gradient from top to
            bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: Very thick, dark, and crusty buildup covering almost the entire surface. Significant pooling and
                dripping. May obscure the original surface texture.

            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: Thick, dark coating with substantial buildup in crevices and along edges. Surface is very sticky
                and may have a crusty appearance.
              thickness: 200-500 μm
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: Noticeable film with some visible pooling in crevices. Surface appears slightly darker.
              thickness: 10-50 μm
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: Significant coating with visible drip marks and pooling. Surface is noticeably darker and stickier.
              thickness: 50-200 μm
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Appears as a slight sheen.
              thickness: <10 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on willow presents as a viscous coating, ranging from a light sheen to
            a thick, dark residue. The color varies from amber to dark brown, with a generally sticky or tacky texture. Accumulation
            is often non-uniform, influenced by gravity and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from leaks), drip marks (on vertical surfaces), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven application), streaky/linear (flow patterns), localized concentrations (in crevices). Edge
            accumulation and drip marks are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension and capillary
            action. It also concentrates in center areas of horizontal surfaces due to pooling. Uniform distribution is rare.
            The mechanism is a combination of surface tension, gravity, and flow dynamics.
          geometry_effects: Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and surface tension. It
            pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces, following contours and bridging small gaps.
            Depressions fill with oil/grease, creating localized reservoirs.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Oil/grease pools at bottom edges and settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes are common. Overhead
            surfaces may exhibit hanging droplets before they detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a glossy sheen. As it ages and oxidizes, the
            surface becomes more matte. Thick buildup can appear almost black and absorb light. Iridescence may be observed
            in thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture is smooth and oily. Over time, it becomes sticky and tacky due to oxidation
            and polymerization. With heavy buildup, it can form a crusty or gummy layer. Microscopic examination may reveal
            particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix. Feels slippery when fresh, then increasingly adhesive as
            it ages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick' layer would be
            1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (flow patterns), pools/puddles
            (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (localized
            contamination), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into the wood), uniform coatings (rare), buildups (thick
            accumulations). Drip marks and thin films are very common.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Variations are caused by uneven application, gravity, surface geometry, and environmental factors (e.g.,
            wind, temperature).
        wrought iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, oily film with a dark gray or brown color. Over time, it
            oxidizes and polymerizes, becoming darker, thicker, and more viscous. After months or years, it hardens into a
            crusty, black or dark brown layer. Rust may form underneath the grease layer, bleeding through as orange discoloration.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. Begins at contact points (lubrication
            fittings) and spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices. Uniform gradual accumulation
            is possible but less common. Layering effects occur with repeated contamination events. Seasonal variations in
            temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination: #362F2E (Dark Charcoal Gray) to #4A3C39 (Dark Taupe). Aged contamination:
            #211E1E (Jet Black), #544A47 (Dark Brown), #736357 (Umber), #80756A (Dark Olive Brown) with possible rust-orange
            (#B7410E) bleed-through from the underlying iron.'
          common_patterns: Localized spots near lubrication points, streaks from dripping or running, accumulation in crevices
            and corners, and a general coating on exposed surfaces. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate thicker layers
            due to settling.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is typically heavier on horizontal surfaces, in crevices and corners, and
            near lubrication points. Vertical surfaces may exhibit streaks and runs, leading to higher concentrations at the
            bottom. Exposed areas tend to have less buildup due to weathering and cleaning.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Thin, barely visible film, 1-5 μm thick, mostly in crevices. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage, thin film with some visible buildup, 5-25 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage,
            visible buildup in most areas, 25-100 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive coverage, thick, crusty buildup, 100-500
            μm thick. Extreme (>85%): Almost complete coverage, very thick, hardened layer, >500 μm thick, potentially several
            millimeters.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on wrought iron presents as a viscous, often dark coating that ranges
            from a thin sheen to a thick, crusty layer. The color is typically dark brown or black, with variations depending
            on the age and composition of the contaminant. It tends to accumulate in crevices and along edges, creating uneven
            coverage.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from lubrication fittings), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (uneven
            application or removal), streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices or corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and capillary action.
            The center of flat surfaces may have a thinner, more uniform coating. This is because the oil/grease tends to
            wick towards the edges.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to capillary action and reduced airflow. Pools on flat
            areas due to gravity. Drips on vertical surfaces due to gravity. Collects at edges due to surface tension. Follows
            contours of the wrought iron structure. Bridges gaps and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects distribution. Downward flow behavior creates drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes, creating a gradient of
            thickness. Hangs from overhead surfaces, forming stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Fresh contamination exhibits a slight sheen or gloss under direct lighting, reflecting light specularly.
            Aged contamination tends to be matte, absorbing light. Under strong lighting, thin films may exhibit iridescent
            effects due to interference.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, sticky, viscous. Aged: Hardened, crusty, sometimes tacky. Can range from smooth
            (thin films) to rough (thick buildup). May exhibit a slight sheen when fresh, becoming matte with age. Microscopic
            examination may reveal particulate matter embedded within the grease matrix.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 1-10 μm. Moderate buildup: 25-250 μm. Heavy buildup: 0.5-5 mm or more. Varies significantly
            depending on the source and duration of contamination.'
          typical_formations: Drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (from gravity), pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces),
            thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches (splatter or uneven application),
            spots/dots (small droplets), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings (rare, usually from intentional
            application), buildups (layered accumulation).
          uniformity_assessment: Distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on the application method, environmental conditions, and the geometry
            of the wrought iron structure. Areas near lubrication points will be heavily contaminated, while sheltered areas
            may have less buildup.
        yttria-stabilized zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, translucent film with a glossy appearance.
            Aged contamination (months/years) becomes thicker, darker, and more opaque. The texture changes from smooth to
            sticky, then crusty or even hard. Oxidation products can form a varnish-like layer on the surface. The color shifts
            from amber/light brown to dark brown/black.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup typically progresses as follows: 1) Starts as a thin film (hours). 2) Begins at contact
            points (e.g., lubrication points) and spreads outward (days). 3) Accumulates at edges due to surface tension (days).
            4) Thickens gradually over time due to continued deposition (weeks). 5) Oxidation and hardening occur, leading
            to a crusty texture (months). 6) Layering effects can be observed if different types of oil/grease are applied
            over time (months/years). Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent amber (#FFBF00 to #FFD700) or light brown
            (#A0522D). As it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark reddish-brown (#800000),
            and eventually a near-black (#000000) with possible iridescent sheens. Sulfurized additives can contribute to
            a greenish-brown tint in some cases.'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in crevices and low points, and
            a general accumulation on horizontal surfaces. Edges and corners often exhibit thicker buildup due to surface
            tension effects. Splatter patterns from rotating machinery are also frequently observed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on horizontal surfaces and in crevices due to gravity
            and capillary action. Edges and corners often exhibit higher concentrations due to surface tension. Top surfaces
            may have less buildup than bottom surfaces due to dripping. Exposed areas may have less buildup than sheltered
            areas due to washing or abrasion.
          coverage_ranges: '1) Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or a very thin, barely visible film. Thickness: <1 μm.
            2) Light (10-30%): A thin, patchy film with some visible streaks or spots. Thickness: 1-10 μm. 3) Moderate (30-60%):
            A more continuous film with thicker accumulations in some areas. Thickness: 10-50 μm. 4) Heavy (60-85%): A thick,
            opaque coating with significant buildup in crevices and low points. Thickness: 50-500 μm. 5) Extreme (>85%): A
            very thick, crusty layer that completely obscures the underlying YSZ surface. Thickness: >500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) typically presents as a viscous,
            non-uniform coating ranging from a barely visible sheen to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The color and texture
            vary significantly depending on the oil's composition, age, and environmental conditions. Coverage patterns are
            often influenced by gravity and surface geometry, leading to localized accumulations and streaks.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating (rare, usually only with very
            light contamination). 2) Edge accumulation (common due to surface tension). 3) Point source spreading (from leaks
            or lubrication points). 4) Gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance). 5) Patchy/spotty (due to
            uneven application or removal). 6) Streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping). 7) Localized concentrations (in crevices
            or low points).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges, creating a thicker layer. While the center may also
            have a coating, the edges are typically more heavily contaminated. This is especially true for sharp edges and
            corners.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to capillary action and surface tension. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating streaks. It collects at edges, forming thicker layers. It follows contours, creating patterns that mirror
            the surface shape. It can bridge gaps, forming solid connections between surfaces. It fills depressions, creating
            smooth, level surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and runs. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low points. Vertical streaking is common on vertical surfaces.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, creating thicker layers. Runs occur down slopes. Oil/grease can hang from
            overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease can exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged contamination
            tends to have a matte finish. Iridescence or rainbow effects can be observed in thin films due to interference.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the darker, more opaque areas of buildup.
          texture_details: Fresh oil/grease is typically smooth and viscous to the touch. As it ages, it becomes sticky and
            tacky. With further aging and oxidation, it can harden into a crusty, brittle, or even slightly crystalline texture.
            The surface can range from glossy when fresh to matte or even powdery when heavily oxidized. Microscopic examination
            may reveal particulate matter embedded within the buildup.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (0.1-5
            mm) or more for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick' layer
            would be 1-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks (vertical streaks of varying thickness). 2) Runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks, but often wider and less defined). 3) Pools/puddles (accumulations in low points). 4)
            Thin films (barely visible coatings). 5) Thick crusts (hardened, oxidized layers). 6) Discrete patches (isolated
            areas of contamination). 7) Spots/dots (small, localized deposits). 8) Stains (discoloration of the YSZ surface).
            9) Buildups (general accumulation of material).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface roughness, temperature gradients,
            airflow patterns, and the method of oil/grease application. Gravity also plays a significant role in creating
            uneven distribution.
        yttrium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Over time (weeks to
            months), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more opaque. Aged contamination often develops a hardened, crusty surface
            layer due to oxidation and polymerization of the hydrocarbons. The color shifts from amber to dark brown or black.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days/weeks. It often begins at contact
            points (lubrication points) and spreads outward. It can also start at edges and move inward. A uniform gradual
            accumulation is possible, but less common than point sources that expand outward. Layering effects occur with
            repeated applications. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#FDD966) with slight iridescence'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellow-Brown (#A07A44)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Dark Brown (#654321) with matte finish'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Black (#000000) with possible hardened crust'
          - 'Oxidized: Reddish-Brown (#800000) due to iron oxide contamination from machinery'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform thin films, localized spots around lubrication points, streaks
            from gravity-driven flow, and accumulation in low-lying areas and crevices. Edges and corners tend to accumulate
            more buildup due to surface tension effects and reduced airflow.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges and corners tend to have heavier buildup due
            to surface tension and reduced airflow. Bottom surfaces accumulate more due to gravity. Crevices and low-lying
            areas trap oil/grease. Flat surfaces may have a more uniform, but thinner, coating. Vertical walls exhibit drip
            marks and streaks.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              typical_thickness: '>1 mm'
              visual_appearance: Very thick, dark, and crusty coating. Obscures the underlying Yttrium surface.

            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              typical_thickness: 10-100 μm
              visual_appearance: Opaque film with visible buildup in crevices and edges. Matte finish.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              typical_thickness: <1 μm
              visual_appearance: Isolated spots and streaks, barely visible film in some areas.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on Yttrium typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges
            from a thin, iridescent film to a thick, tar-like accumulation. The color is initially light amber but darkens
            to brown and eventually black with age and oxidation. Coverage patterns vary from uniform films to localized deposits,
            often concentrated in crevices and edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, only with spray application),
            edge accumulation (common due to surface tension), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear
            (from dripping or wiping), localized concentrations (in crevices), and radial patterns (around rotating parts).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects and reduced airflow, which hinders evaporation. It also concentrates in center areas around lubrication
            points. Uniform distribution is rare unless specifically applied as a coating.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension. It builds up in crevices, pools on flat areas, drips on vertical surfaces, collects at
            edges, follows contours, bridges gaps, and fills depressions. Sharp edges tend to have thicker buildup than rounded
            surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease
            settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs occur down slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, forming droplets
            that eventually drip.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease exhibits a slight sheen or iridescence. Indoor fluorescent
            lighting reveals a matte finish, especially with aged contamination. The color appears darker and less vibrant
            under low lighting conditions. Thick buildup may cast shadows, highlighting its uneven surface.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged
            exposure and oxidation, it becomes hard, crusty, and sometimes brittle. Microscopic examination may reveal particulate
            matter embedded within the grease matrix. It feels slippery when fresh, and rough/gritty when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer is approximately 25-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick' layer is roughly
            1-2 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (from gravity flow),
            pools/puddles (in low-lying areas), thin films (on flat surfaces), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete patches
            (from localized contamination), spots/dots (from splattering), stains (penetrated into porous areas), uniform
            coatings (rare), buildups (at joints and seams), and sometimes, crystalline structures (from additive precipitation).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the application method, operating conditions, and the
            geometry of the Yttrium surface. Uneven wear, temperature gradients, and airflow contribute to non-uniformity.
        zinc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, light-colored film. Aged contamination (months/years)
            becomes darker, thicker, and more viscous. It may also exhibit signs of oxidation, such as a reddish-brown discoloration
            and a hardened, crusty texture. The buildup can become quite substantial, reaching several millimeters in thickness
            in extreme cases.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often
            begins at contact points or lubrication points and spreads outward. Accumulation may start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible but less common than point-source expansion. Layering effects can occur
            with repeated applications or changes in oil/grease type. Seasonal variations in temperature can affect viscosity
            and flow, influencing the buildup rate. Months/years lead to significant crusting and oxidation.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light amber, almost transparent (#F8DE7E)'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium brown (#8B4513)'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black (#301900)'
          - 'Oxidized/Heat-Affected: Reddish-brown (#A52A2A)'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and accumulation
            along edges and seams. Initial contamination often appears as a thin, even film, which then thickens and becomes
            more localized over time. Areas exposed to high temperatures may exhibit a baked-on appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, in crevices, and on horizontal surfaces due
            to gravity and surface tension. Top surfaces may be lighter due to runoff. Corners and sheltered areas often accumulate
            more buildup than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks and streaks, with heavier concentrations at
            the bottom.

              coverage: <10%
              description: Isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Appears as slight discoloration.
              thickness: <5 μm
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on zinc typically presents as a viscous, dark coating that ranges from
            a thin, almost imperceptible film to a thick, tacky layer. The color varies from light amber to dark brown or
            black, depending on the age and composition of the contaminant. It often exhibits a non-uniform distribution,
            accumulating in crevices and along edges.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (rare, usually initial stage), edge
            accumulation (very common), point source spreading (around lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing
            thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due to uneven application or wear), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping),
            localized concentrations (in crevices or around fasteners). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are the
            most prevalent.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial oil/grease preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects.
            The oil/grease tends to 'wet' the edges more readily than the flat surfaces, leading to a higher concentration
            along the perimeter. This effect is particularly pronounced in areas with sharp corners or rough edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and capillary action. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces.
            It collects at edges due to surface tension. It may bridge small gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks and vertical
            streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil/grease may
            hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets or stalactite-like formations. The flow rate depends on the viscosity
            and temperature of the oil/grease.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. As it ages and becomes
            more oxidized, the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to highlight the color variations
            and surface irregularities. Very thick layers may exhibit a slight iridescence due to thin-film interference.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it ages. With significant
            oxidation and polymerization, it can become hard, crusty, and even slightly brittle. Microscopic examination may
            reveal particulate matter (e.g., zinc oxide, wear debris) embedded within the grease matrix. The surface can appear
            glossy when wet and matte when dry.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (2-10 μm) for a thin film to several millimeters (1-5 mm)
            or more for heavy buildup. A 'paper-thin' layer would be approximately 50-100 μm, while a 'coin-thick' layer could
            be 2-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, oxidized buildup),
            discrete patches (uneven application), spots/dots (splatter or localized leaks), stains (penetration into the
            zinc surface), uniform coatings (rare, initial stage), buildups (localized accumulations).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare, except immediately after application. The non-uniformity is caused by factors such as gravity,
            surface tension, temperature gradients, and the presence of contaminants or surface imperfections.
        zirconia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, transparent or light amber film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes a thick, dark brown or black crust, often with a hardened, cracked surface. The aged material
            is less soluble in solvents and more difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over time (days/weeks). It often begins
            at contact points or lubrication points and spreads outward. Buildup can also start at edges and move inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible with consistent lubrication. Layering effects occur with repeated applications
            or changes in oil type. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of oxidation and buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often starts as a translucent amber (#FFBF00) or light brown (#A0785A). As
            it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to a medium brown (#8B4513), then a dark reddish-brown (#800000), and eventually
            a near-black (#000000) with possible iridescent sheens due to thin-film interference.
          common_patterns: The buildup tends to accumulate in areas with lower shear stress, such as edges, corners, and crevices.
            It often forms drip marks on vertical surfaces and pools on horizontal surfaces. Initial contamination often appears
            as a thin film, followed by localized buildup in areas of high friction or heat.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to surface tension and reduced
            flow. Top surfaces exposed to dripping or splashing may have heavier concentrations than bottom surfaces. Crevices
            and sheltered areas accumulate more buildup than exposed areas. Vertical walls exhibit drip marks, while horizontal
            surfaces accumulate pools.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Appears as isolated spots or a very thin, almost invisible film. Thickness
            < 1 μm. Light (10-30%): A thin, translucent film with some visible patches. Thickness 1-5 μm. Moderate (30-60%):
            A more visible coating with distinct color variations and some buildup in corners. Thickness 5-50 μm. Heavy (60-85%):
            A thick, dark coating with significant buildup and crust formation. Thickness 50-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): A very
            thick, dark, and crusty deposit covering almost the entire surface. Thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on zirconia typically appears as a viscous, non-uniform coating, ranging
            from a thin, almost invisible film to a thick, dark brown or black crust. The appearance varies greatly depending
            on the oil type, operating temperature, and exposure time, but generally exhibits a matte finish with localized
            glossy patches.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point
            source spreading (from lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty
            (due to uneven surface finish), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations (in low-flow
            areas). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension
            effects and reduced shear stress. It follows the perimeter of the component. The mechanism is related to the minimization
            of surface energy and the tendency of liquids to wet surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil/grease accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to surface tension and reduced flow. It pools on flat areas due to gravity. It drips on vertical surfaces
            due to gravity. It collects at edges due to surface tension. It follows contours, bridges gaps, and fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior results in pooling at bottom edges and
            drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Oil/grease settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs down
            slopes. Hanging from overhead surfaces is possible, especially with viscous greases. Drip marks can extend several
            centimeters downwards.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil/grease may exhibit a slight sheen or gloss. Aged deposits tend
            to have a matte finish. Thin films can produce iridescent rainbow effects due to thin-film interference, especially
            under bright, focused light. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to make the darker deposits appear more dull and
            less reflective.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from smooth and oily when fresh to sticky and tacky as it begins to oxidize.
            With prolonged exposure and heat cycling, it becomes a hard, crusty deposit, often with a slightly rough or granular
            surface. It feels waxy or greasy to the touch when fresh, and brittle or flaky when aged.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-5 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. Heavily loaded areas can reach thicknesses of 10mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged buildup), discrete
            patches (localized wear), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetration into porous areas), uniform coatings (fresh
            application), buildups (at edges/corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly. Freshly applied lubricant may be mostly uniform with minor variations.
            As it ages, the distribution becomes moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular, concentrated in specific
            areas due to temperature gradients, flow patterns, and surface irregularities. The uniformity level is primarily
            affected by operating conditions and surface finish.
        zirconium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, translucent film with a slight sheen. Over time (weeks to
            months), it darkens, thickens, and becomes more opaque. The surface texture changes from smooth to sticky to crusty.
            Aged deposits are often harder to remove and may exhibit signs of oxidation (rust-orange color). Thickness increases
            significantly with age.
          buildup_progression: Starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens over days. Begins at contact points (e.g., lubrication
            points) then spreads outward. Starts at edges then moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is rare. Point sources
            expand outward. Layering effects occur with repeated applications or leaks. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can affect the rate of buildup. Months to years for significant buildup.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Light Amber (#F8DE7E) with iridescent sheen'
          - 'Slightly Aged: Yellowish-Brown (#C49102)'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Medium Brown (#8B4513) with darker edges'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark Brown (#3E2723) to Black (#000000) in high-temperature areas'
          - 'Oxidized: Rust-Orange (#B7410E) mixed with dark brown'
          common_patterns: Distribution is rarely uniform. It tends to accumulate in low-lying areas, edges, crevices, and
            around fittings. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. High-temperature zones often exhibit
            a baked-on, hardened appearance.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Bottom surfaces accumulate more oil due to gravity. Corners and sheltered areas also tend to
            have higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient from top to bottom due to dripping.
          coverage_ranges:
            extreme:
              coverage: '>85%'
              description: 'Very thick, crusty coating with extensive buildup. Thickness: >200 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Completely covered in a thick, dark, crusty layer.
            heavy:
              coverage: 60-85%
              description: 'Thick, dark coating with significant buildup. Thickness: 50-200 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Dark, greasy surface, significant buildup in crevices and edges.
            light:
              coverage: 10-30%
              description: 'Thin, translucent film with some visible streaks and spots. Thickness: 1-10 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Slightly discolored surface, visible streaks and droplets.
            moderate:
              coverage: 30-60%
              description: 'Opaque film with visible buildup in crevices and edges. Thickness: 10-50 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Noticeably discolored surface, buildup in low-lying areas.
            sparse:
              coverage: <10%
              description: 'Isolated spots or thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness: <1 μm.'
              visual_appearance: Barely perceptible sheen, isolated droplets.
          description: Industrial oil/grease buildup on zirconium typically presents as a viscous, non-uniform coating. Initially,
            it appears as a thin, iridescent film, progressing to a thicker, darker, and more opaque layer with time. The
            color ranges from light amber to dark brown, often with localized areas of black, especially in high-temperature
            zones.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), point source spreading
            (from leaks or lubrication points), gradient from source (decreasing thickness with distance), patchy/spotty (due
            to uneven application or localized contamination), streaky/linear (due to flow or wiping), localized concentrations
            (around fittings or seals). Edge accumulation and point source spreading are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension. The oil tends to wick along edges,
            creating a thicker deposit compared to the center areas. This effect is particularly noticeable on flat surfaces
            and around the perimeter of components.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners due to surface tension. Builds up in crevices and around threads. Pools
            on flat areas. Drips on vertical surfaces. Collects at edges. Follows contours. Bridges gaps between components.
            Fills depressions. These effects are driven by surface tension, gravity, and capillary action.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow behavior is prominent, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top
            to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces. Runs down slopes. Hanging from
            overhead surfaces is possible but less common due to the viscosity of the oil.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil films exhibit an iridescent sheen. Indoor fluorescent lighting
            reveals the amber to brown color variations more clearly. Aged deposits tend to have a matte finish and may appear
            darker under all lighting conditions. The presence of metallic particles can create a slight metallic sheen in
            some areas.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and oily, becoming sticky and tacky as it ages. With prolonged exposure to heat
            and oxidation, it can transform into a hard, crusty, or even slightly crystalline deposit. The surface can range
            from glossy to matte depending on the degree of oxidation and the presence of particulate contaminants. Touch
            feels greasy initially, then becomes increasingly rough and abrasive with age.
          thickness_range: From a thin film (0.1-1 μm) when freshly applied to a heavy buildup (100 μm - 2 mm) after months
            or years of accumulation. Varies significantly based on operating conditions and maintenance schedules.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (on vertical surfaces), runs/streaks (due to flow), pools/puddles (on horizontal
            surfaces), thin films (initial contamination), thick crusts (aged, oxidized deposits), discrete patches (localized
            spills), spots/dots (splatter), stains (penetrated into the surface), uniform coatings (rare, usually only with
            specialized application), buildups (around fittings), crystalline structures (rare, under specific high-temperature
            conditions).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely uniform due to factors such as gravity,
            surface tension, airflow, and localized sources of contamination. Uniformity is further disrupted by temperature
            gradients and the presence of mechanical components.

      appearance_on_materials:
        alabaster:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light orange-brown stain, easily smeared. Aged rust (months/years)
            becomes darker, more deeply embedded, and more difficult to remove. Hydrated iron oxides may appear, giving a
            lighter, more coral-like hue.
          buildup_progression: Buildup progresses from initial spotting (hours/days) to streaking and pooling (days/weeks)
            to crust formation and deep staining (months/years). The rate of buildup is highly dependent on environmental
            conditions, particularly humidity and the concentration of iron in the water source.
          color_variations:
          - '#D2691E chocolate-brown (initial)'
          - '#B87333 copper (early)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (intermediate)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown (aged)'
          - '#E9967A light-coral (hydrated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots are the most common initial pattern. These spots can then develop into streaks,
            particularly on vertical surfaces, due to water runoff carrying dissolved iron. In areas with prolonged exposure
            to iron-rich water, pooling and crust formation are observed.
          concentration_variations: Rust tends to concentrate at edges and corners due to capillary action and water accumulation.
            Crevices and surface imperfections also act as collection points. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but
            lighter, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in areas with minimal exposure to extreme (>85%) in areas with
            prolonged exposure to iron-rich water and favorable conditions for rust formation.
          description: Rust formation on alabaster manifests as reddish-brown discoloration, initially appearing as small,
            localized spots that gradually expand and coalesce. The porous nature of alabaster facilitates deep penetration
            of iron oxides, leading to staining that is difficult to remove. The dominant colors are variations of reddish-brown
            and orange, with coverage ranging from sparse to heavy depending on the iron source and exposure time.
          distribution_patterns: The distribution is highly dependent on the source of iron and the presence of moisture.
            It tends to concentrate around areas where iron-containing water drips or pools. The porous nature of alabaster
            allows for deep penetration, leading to staining that extends beyond the immediate surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Rust often prefers edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture and iron-containing
            runoff. The center of large, flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but less intense, discoloration.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences rust distribution.凹陷 and crevices act as traps for iron-containing
            water, leading to localized buildup. Sloping surfaces promote runoff and streaking.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the pattern formation. Downward flow of iron-containing water
            results in vertical streaking. Pooling occurs in low-lying areas where water accumulates.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust tends to have a matte finish. As the rust ages and forms a thicker crust, it may exhibit
            a slight sheen, particularly when wet. There is no iridescence observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the rust may appear as a fine, powdery deposit. Over time, especially with moisture
            exposure, it can become crusty and slightly raised above the alabaster surface. The texture is generally rough
            and uneven, contrasting with the smooth, polished surface of clean alabaster.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the rust layer varies significantly. Initial deposits may be only a few micrometers
            (1-5 μm) thick. In areas with heavy buildup, the rust crust can reach thicknesses of several hundred micrometers
            (100-500 μm), or even a millimeter (1 mm) in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include drip marks (vertical streaks), pools (localized accumulations in
            depressions), thin films (uniform coating on flat surfaces), and crusts (thick, raised deposits in areas of heavy
            buildup). Patches of discoloration are also common.
          uniformity_assessment: The rust distribution is rarely perfectly uniform. It is typically highly variable, with
            some areas exhibiting heavy buildup and others remaining relatively clean.
        alumina:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a thin, vibrant orange-red film. Aged rust (months/years) becomes
            darker, thicker, more brittle, and exhibits a deeper brown color with increased surface roughness and potential
            flaking.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial formation (hours): Thin, orange-red film. Days: Film thickens, color deepens to rust-orange.
            Weeks: Powdery rust begins to form, localized spots become more pronounced. Months: Crusty patches develop, color
            darkens to brown, flaking may occur. Years: Thick, brittle crusts with significant surface roughness.'
          color_variations:
          - '#E07A5F rust-red (fresh)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown'
          - '#654321 chocolate-brown (aged)'
          - '#A0522D sienna (intermediate)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks originating from iron contamination points, drip marks if moisture is
            present, and general surface staining.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture and contaminants
            tend to accumulate. Lighter concentrations on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the alumina
            surface is heavily contaminated with iron and exposed to prolonged moisture.
          description: Rust formation on alumina typically appears as localized, reddish-brown deposits. Initially, it forms
            as a thin film, gradually thickening into crusty patches with a non-uniform distribution. The dominant colors
            are variations of orange and brown, often concentrated in areas with surface defects or higher iron contamination.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, concentrated around iron contamination sites, scratches, or surface defects.
            Can also follow grain boundaries in the alumina substrate if present.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased surface area and moisture retention, but can also
            form at the center if there is a localized iron contamination source.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased surface area and potential
            for moisture retention. Concave surfaces may also trap moisture and promote rust formation.
          gravity_influence: Downward flow of rust-containing solutions leads to vertical streaking and pooling at the bottom
            of vertical surfaces. Gravity also influences the settling of rust particles, contributing to uneven distribution.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a slight sheen due to its thin, relatively smooth surface. Aged rust is typically
            matte due to its rough, porous texture. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and film-like, transitioning to rough, powdery, and eventually crusty as the rust
            thickens. Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with varying degrees of crystallinity depending on
            environmental conditions.
          thickness_range: From 0.1 micrometers (initial film) to 50 micrometers or more (thick crusts).
          typical_formations: Thin films, drip marks (if exposed to rain or condensation), small pools in surface depressions,
            crusts, and irregular patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rarely perfectly uniform, typically localized and patchy.
        aluminum:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery coating. Aged rust (months/years) becomes darker,
            more consolidated, and may exhibit signs of underlying aluminum corrosion (pitting).
          buildup_progression: Initially, small specks appear within hours/days. Over weeks/months, these specks grow and
            coalesce, forming larger patches. Hydration leads to a more crusty and voluminous appearance. Years of exposure
            can lead to significant pitting corrosion beneath the rust layer.
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (initial)'
          - '#E07A5F salmon-rust'
          - '#CD5C5C indian-red'
          - '#B83F09 burnt-sienna'
          - '#8B0000 dark-red (aged)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks originating from iron-containing contaminants, drip marks if moisture
            is present, and pitting corrosion underneath the rust.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations occur around the initial point of iron contamination, edges of
            scratches, or in crevices where moisture and contaminants accumulate.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to light (10-30%) is most common. Moderate (30-60%) coverage is rare and indicates
            significant iron contamination.
          description: Rust formation on aluminum is atypical and usually indicates iron contamination. The resulting iron
            oxide appears as localized spots or streaks, ranging from a light orange to a dark reddish-brown, often contrasting
            sharply with the aluminum's silvery surface. Coverage is generally sparse to light.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, localized around iron-rich particles or areas of surface damage where iron was
            introduced.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas of surface damage, rather than uniform distribution across the center.
          geometry_effects: Rust tends to accumulate in corners, edges, and crevices due to increased moisture retention and
            contaminant accumulation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause rust particles to be washed down vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Pooling
            may occur in horizontal depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can have a slightly dull sheen, especially if hydrated.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and loosely adhered, becoming more crusty and adherent with age due to further
            oxidation and hydration. The texture is generally rough and porous.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, depending on the extent of iron contamination and exposure
            time.
          typical_formations: Small patches, drip marks (if exposed to rain or condensation), and thin films spreading from
            the point of origin.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated specks to small, concentrated patches.
        ash:
          aged_appearance: 'Fresh rust (hours/days) exhibits a lighter, more orange-red hue (#F08080) and a powdery texture.
            Aged rust (months/years) darkens to a deep reddish-brown (#8B0000 or #4B0082), becomes more consolidated, and
            forms a thicker, crustier layer.'
          buildup_progression: Initial discoloration (hours/days), followed by the formation of small rust spots (days/weeks).
            These spots grow and coalesce over time (weeks/months), eventually forming a continuous layer or crust (months/years).
            The rate of buildup depends on environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, presence of salts) and the iron
            content of the ash.
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 salmon'
          - '#CD5C5C indianred'
          - '#B22222 firebrick'
          - '#8B0000 darkred'
          - '#4B0082 indigo'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following ash grain, drip marks on vertical surfaces, and pooling in depressions.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices where moisture
            and iron particles accumulate. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but thinner, layer of rust.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) in early stages to extreme (>85%) in advanced corrosion scenarios. Light
            (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) coverage are common intermediate stages.
          description: Rust formation on ash surfaces typically presents as a non-uniform, reddish-brown to dark brown discoloration.
            The rust often appears as localized spots or streaks, influenced by the ash's porous nature and surface geometry.
            Over time, the color darkens and the texture becomes more crusty.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential formation at points of iron particle concentration within
            the ash matrix. Follows the ash's inherent porosity and surface irregularities.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture and contaminants, as well
            as potential galvanic effects if dissimilar metals are present.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences rust distribution. Edges and corners act as collection
            points for moisture and iron particles, leading to accelerated corrosion. Concave surfaces tend to accumulate
            more rust than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the formation of drip marks and the pooling of corrosive
            solutions. Vertical surfaces exhibit downward streaking, while horizontal surfaces may show localized pooling.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can display a slight sheen due to the formation
            of denser oxide layers, but generally remains matte.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and somewhat smooth, transitioning to rough, crusty, and potentially flaky as
            the rust ages and thickens. Microscopic examination reveals crystalline structures interspersed with amorphous
            iron oxide particles.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial discoloration) to 100 micrometers or more in heavily
            corroded areas. Crusts can reach up to 1 millimeter in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, small pools in depressions, thin films covering larger areas,
            and localized crusts where corrosion is most intense. Patches of rust are common, varying in size and thickness.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse isolated spots to near-complete coverage in severely
            affected areas.
        bamboo:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a bright orange-pink dust. Aged rust (months/years) becomes
            darker, more consolidated, and may exhibit a cracked or flaking surface. The color shifts from orange to reddish-brown
            and eventually to dark brown.
          buildup_progression: Initial spotting occurs within hours of exposure to moisture and iron. Light rust forms within
            days. Moderate rust develops over weeks to months. Heavy rust requires months to years of continuous exposure.
            The rate of buildup is highly dependent on environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, presence of salts).
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (initial)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange (fresh)'
          - '#A04000 reddish-brown (moderate)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown (aged)'
          - '#603813 dark-brown (advanced)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around metallic fasteners (nails, screws, wires), streaks running downwards from
            these points due to water runoff, and general discoloration in areas of prolonged moisture exposure.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of metallic fasteners, in crevices
            where moisture accumulates, and along vertical surfaces where water runoff occurs. Flat surfaces may exhibit a
            thinner, more dispersed layer of rust.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in the early stages to light (10-30%) with initial spotting,
            moderate (30-60%) with localized streaking, heavy (60-85%) in areas of prolonged exposure, and rarely extreme
            (>85%) unless the bamboo is completely submerged in a corrosive environment.
          description: Rust formation on bamboo presents as a non-uniform coating, initially appearing as small, localized
            spots of orange-brown discoloration. Over time, these spots expand and coalesce, forming a more extensive, textured
            layer with a dominant color range from reddish-brown to dark brown. The rust is typically associated with metallic
            fasteners or contact points with iron-containing materials.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around iron sources, with secondary distribution via water runoff and
            capillary action within the bamboo's porous structure. Concentric rings may form around the initial point of corrosion.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas surrounding metallic fasteners. The center of the bamboo culm is less
            likely to exhibit rust formation unless there is a direct source of iron contamination.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased surface area and moisture
            retention. Grooves and indentations act as channels for water runoff, leading to streaking patterns.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of rust, causing downward flow of rust-laden
            water and the formation of vertical streaks. Pooling of water at the base of bamboo structures can lead to localized
            areas of heavy rust accumulation.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As the rust ages and becomes more compact, it may develop
            a slight sheen, especially when wet. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and slightly rough, transitioning to a more crusty and adherent texture as the
            rust ages and hydrates. Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with crystalline formations of iron
            oxides and hydroxides.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 micrometers (initial spots) to 50-500 micrometers (advanced, layered
            rust). In extreme cases, buildup can reach 1-2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: Drip marks extending downwards from corrosion points, small pools of rust accumulating in depressions,
            thin films coating the bamboo surface, and thicker crusts forming around fasteners or in areas of prolonged moisture
            exposure. Patches of discoloration are also common.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. The rust formation is rarely uniform, exhibiting significant variations
            in thickness, color, and texture across the bamboo surface.
        basalt:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a thin, bright orange film. Aged rust (months/years) becomes
            darker, thicker, and more textured, often exhibiting a dark reddish-brown to black coloration with a crusty or
            granular surface.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial formation (hours/days): Thin, orange film. Intermediate (weeks/months): Development
            of localized spots and patches, color darkening. Advanced (months/years): Thickening of deposits, crust formation,
            significant color change to dark reddish-brown or black.'
          color_variations:
          - '#E25822 rust-orange (fresh)'
          - '#B7410E reddish-brown (intermediate)'
          - '#800000 dark-red (advanced oxidation)'
          - '#463E3F dark-brown/black (highly hydrated/aged)'
          - '#F08080 light coral (early stage)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots and patches are common, often concentrated around surface imperfections or areas
            of higher moisture retention. Streaks and drip marks are observed on vertical surfaces due to gravity-driven water
            flow.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, crevices, and areas where
            water tends to accumulate. Flat, exposed surfaces may exhibit lighter, more uniform rust films.
          coverage_ranges: Ranges from sparse (<10%) in dry environments to extreme (>85%) in highly humid or marine environments.
            Light (10-30%) to moderate (30-60%) coverage is common in moderately exposed conditions.
          description: Rust formation on basalt presents as a spectrum of reddish-brown hues, initially appearing as a thin
            film and evolving into localized, textured deposits. The color ranges from bright orange to dark, almost black,
            depending on hydration and oxidation state. Coverage varies significantly based on environmental exposure and
            basalt composition.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized, with preferential formation at grain boundaries, micro-cracks, and areas
            of surface damage. Can also appear as a general surface coating, especially in highly humid environments.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas with surface irregularities initially, then spreads towards the center
            as the process continues.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences rust distribution. Concave surfaces and crevices trap
            moisture, promoting localized rust formation. Edges and corners are also prone to higher rust concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling of rust deposits
            at lower points on the basalt surface.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a slight sheen, while aged rust tends to be matte. Under oblique lighting,
            the textured surface of aged rust casts shadows, enhancing its roughness.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and film-like, transitioning to rough, powdery, and eventually crusty or granular
            as the rust thickens. Microscopic examination reveals crystalline structures in some areas, particularly in advanced
            stages.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 micrometers (fresh) to 50-500 micrometers (aged), with localized deposits
            potentially reaching 1-2 millimeters in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pools in depressions, thin films on flat surfaces, crusts and
            patches in areas of prolonged moisture exposure.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from near-uniform thin films to highly localized and concentrated
            deposits.
        beech:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a bright orange dust. Over months/years, it darkens to a deep
            reddish-brown or almost black, becoming more consolidated and crust-like. Aged rust often exhibits cracking and
            delamination.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial staining (hours/days): fine orange dust. Light coating (weeks): reddish-brown discoloration.
            Moderate buildup (months): crusty patches and streaks. Heavy buildup (years): thick, consolidated crusts with
            potential wood degradation.'
          color_variations:
          - '#D35400 rust-orange (fresh)'
          - '#C0392B reddish-brown (intermediate)'
          - '#943126 dark reddish-brown (aged)'
          - '#54231D near-black (advanced oxidation)'
          - '#E67E22 yellowish-orange (goethite-rich)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around iron contact points (nails, screws), streaks following the grain of the
            wood, drip marks from runoff, and general surface staining.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found around edges, corners, and crevices where moisture
            and iron particles accumulate. Flat surfaces tend to exhibit a more uniform, but often lighter, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the proximity to iron sources, exposure to moisture,
            and duration of exposure. Light (10-30%) is common in early stages. Moderate (30-60%) is typical after several
            months of exposure. Heavy (60-85%) occurs in areas with direct iron contact and prolonged moisture exposure.
          description: Rust formation on beech presents as a spectrum of reddish-brown hues, initially appearing as localized
            spots and streaks that gradually coalesce into a more widespread coating. The color ranges from bright orange
            to dark, almost black, depending on the oxidation state and hydration level of the iron oxide. Coverage varies
            greatly depending on exposure and surface conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around iron sources. Follows the grain of the wood, concentrating in
            pores and surface irregularities. Drip patterns are common on vertical surfaces.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas around iron fasteners. Center areas of large, flat surfaces tend to
            have less rust unless uniformly exposed to iron-containing water.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners act as collection points for moisture and iron particles, leading to accelerated
            rust formation. Surface irregularities provide nucleation sites for rust growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of rust-laden water, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the base of vertical surfaces. This is especially noticeable on exposed beams and posts.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As it ages and consolidates, it may develop a slight sheen,
            especially when wet. No significant iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, becoming increasingly crusty and flaky with age. Microscopic
            examination reveals a porous structure with varying degrees of crystallinity. The surface can feel rough to the
            touch, especially with thicker deposits.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial staining) to 500 micrometers (thick, aged crusts).
            Thicker deposits can reach up to 1-2 millimeters in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: Drip marks, pools in low-lying areas, thin films on exposed surfaces, crusts around iron sources,
            and localized patches of concentrated rust.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform staining on smooth, exposed surfaces to highly
            localized and concentrated deposits around iron sources.
        beryllium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust appears as a lighter, more orange-toned brown. Over time (months to years), it darkens
            to a deeper, more chocolate-like brown and becomes more tightly bound to the beryllium surface. The texture also
            becomes more consolidated and crusty.
          buildup_progression: Initial discoloration (hours to days) -> Formation of fine, powdery spots (days to weeks) ->
            Gradual thickening and darkening of deposits (weeks to months) -> Consolidation and crust formation (months to
            years). The rate is highly dependent on environmental conditions.
          color_variations:
          - '#D2691E rust-brown (fresh)'
          - '#A0522D sienna-brown (intermediate)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown (aged)'
          - '#463E3F dark-brown (heavily oxidized)'
          - '#F08080 light-coral (early stages, trace amounts)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, thin films, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), and accumulation in crevices
            or around surface defects.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, crevices, and areas of surface
            damage. Flat surfaces tend to exhibit thinner, more uniform films.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to light (10-30%) is most common in typical environments. Moderate (30-60%) coverage
            is observed in more aggressive conditions. Heavy (>60%) and extreme (>85%) coverage are rare on beryllium.
          description: Rust formation on beryllium is characterized by a reddish-brown to dark brown discoloration, typically
            appearing as localized spots or a thin film. The process is generally slow due to beryllium's inherent corrosion
            resistance, but can be accelerated by humidity and contaminants. The rust appears as a powdery or slightly crusty
            deposit, often concentrated at surface imperfections.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential formation at sites of surface defects, scratches, or contamination.
            Often observed at grain boundaries in polycrystalline beryllium.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas with surface defects over the center of flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased exposure to environmental
            factors and potential for stress concentration.
          gravity_influence: On vertical surfaces, gravity can lead to downward streaking of rust particles, especially during
            periods of high humidity or condensation. Pooling is minimal.
          lighting_effects: Generally matte, with minimal sheen. Thicker deposits may exhibit a slight dullness. No iridescence
            is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, becoming slightly crusty and more adherent with prolonged exposure.
            Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with loosely bound particles. The surface is generally rough
            to the touch, especially with thicker deposits.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers for thin films to 20-50 micrometers for localized, thicker
            deposits. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 100 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Thin films, small patches, localized crusts, and occasional drip marks on vertical surfaces.
            No significant pooling is observed due to the relatively slow oxidation rate.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from sparse, isolated spots to a more continuous, but still uneven,
            coating.
        birch:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) is typically a lighter, more powdery orange. Aged rust (months/years) becomes
            darker, more consolidated, and often incorporates organic matter from the wood, resulting in a darker, almost
            blackish-brown appearance.
          buildup_progression: Initial spotting (hours/days), expansion along grain (days/weeks), consolidation and darkening
            (weeks/months), crust formation and significant staining (months/years).
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (early stage)'
          - '#CD5C5C salmon-rust (initial oxidation)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange (moderate oxidation)'
          - '#A52A2A reddish-brown (advanced oxidation)'
          - '#4E342E dark brown (aged rust)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around iron contact points, streaks following the wood grain, drip marks from runoff,
            and general surface staining.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found around the initial iron source, in crevices
            where moisture accumulates, and along edges where runoff occurs. Flat surfaces tend to have a thinner, more diffuse
            layer.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in early stages, light (10-30%) in areas with minimal iron contact, moderate (30-60%)
            in areas with moderate iron contamination, heavy (60-85%) around heavily corroded iron sources, and extreme (>85%)
            only in rare cases of complete iron oxide coverage.
          description: 'Rust formation on birch presents as a heterogeneous mix of reddish-brown and dark brown iron oxides,
            typically concentrated around areas where iron particles are in contact with the wood and moisture. The rust initially
            appears as small, localized spots and gradually expands, often following the grain of the wood. Dominant colors
            are #A52A2A and #4E342E.'
          distribution_patterns: Localized around iron sources (nails, screws, filings), spreading along the wood grain, and
            accumulating in low-lying areas due to gravity.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas around iron sources initially, then spreads towards the center of
            surfaces as oxidation progresses.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased exposure to moisture and potential
            for iron particle accumulation. Grooves and indentations act as collection points for rust particles and moisture.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of rust-laden water, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the base of vertical surfaces. This effect is more pronounced on smooth surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can develop a slight sheen due to the consolidation
            of the oxide layer. No significant iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and slightly rough, transitioning to a more crusty and adherent texture as the
            oxidation process progresses. Microscopic examination reveals crystalline structures interspersed with amorphous
            iron oxide particles.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-50 micrometers in early stages, increasing to 100-500 micrometers or more
            in heavily corroded areas over extended periods.
          typical_formations: Drip marks are common on vertical surfaces. Pools of rust can form in depressions. Thin films
            spread across the surface. Crusts develop in areas of heavy oxidation. Patches of varying size and shape are the
            most prevalent formation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rust formation is rarely uniform on birch due to variations in wood density,
            surface roughness, and the distribution of iron particles.
        bluestone:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) is typically a bright orange-red and powdery. Aged rust (months/years)
            darkens to a deep brown or black, becomes more crusty, and may exhibit signs of flaking or spalling of the bluestone
            surface.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial discoloration (hours/days): faint orange spots. Light rust formation (weeks): expansion
            of spots, formation of streaks. Moderate rust formation (months): coalescence of spots, darkening of color, increased
            thickness. Heavy rust formation (years): significant discoloration, crust formation, potential for bluestone degradation.'
          color_variations:
          - '#D2691E rust-orange (fresh)'
          - '#A0522D sienna-brown (intermediate)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown (aged)'
          - '#CD5C5C indian-red (hydrated)'
          - '#463E3F dark-brown/black (heavily oxidized)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around iron-containing inclusions, streaks from water runoff, and general discoloration
            across the surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and in crevices where moisture
            tends to linger. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more uniform, but often lighter, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to heavy (60-85%) depending on the iron content of the bluestone, environmental conditions,
            and duration of exposure. Extreme coverage (>85%) is rare but possible in severely affected areas.
          description: Rust formation on bluestone manifests as reddish-brown discoloration, initially appearing as localized
            spots and streaks that gradually expand and coalesce. The color ranges from bright orange to dark brown, with
            coverage varying from sparse to heavy depending on exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: Localized around iron-rich inclusions, along edges and corners where water accumulates, and
            in areas with surface imperfections.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially, spreading towards the center as oxidation progresses.
            Areas around iron inclusions will also be primary sites.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased exposure to moisture and oxygen.
            Surface irregularities and indentations provide sites for rust nucleation and growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes water runoff to create streaks and drip marks, concentrating rust formation along
            vertical pathways. Pooling occurs in low-lying areas, leading to thicker rust deposits.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can have a slightly dull sheen, especially when
            hydrated. Under direct sunlight, the reddish hues are more pronounced.
          texture_details: Initially, the rust may appear as a fine, powdery coating. As it ages and hydrates, it can become
            crusty and slightly raised. The texture varies from smooth to rough depending on the degree of oxidation and hydration.
          thickness_range: The rust layer typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach up to 200 micrometers in
            areas with prolonged exposure and heavy oxidation.
          typical_formations: Drip marks from water runoff, small pools in depressions, thin films covering larger areas,
            and localized crusts around points of origin.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rust formation is rarely perfectly uniform, with significant variations
            in color, thickness, and coverage across the bluestone surface.
        borosilicate glass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery coating. Aged rust (months/years) becomes darker,
            more consolidated, and may exhibit a slightly crystalline appearance under magnification.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial deposition (hours): fine, light orange powder. Days: increased color intensity and
            patch formation. Weeks/Months: consolidation of rust, formation of crusts, and potential for increased thickness.
            Years: further darkening, increased adhesion, and potential for localized pitting of the glass surface (though
            rare).'
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 salmon'
          - '#E97451 burnt-sienna'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown'
          - '#654321 dark-brown'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks, drip marks (if moisture is present), and ring formations around the perimeter
            of droplets.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at the edges of droplets or in crevices where
            moisture and iron particles accumulate. Flat surfaces tend to have lighter, more dispersed deposits.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to light (10-30%) is most common. Moderate (30-60%) or higher coverage is rare on
            borosilicate glass unless heavily contaminated and exposed to prolonged moisture.
          description: Rust formation on borosilicate glass manifests as localized, non-uniform deposits ranging from a light
            orange hue to a dark reddish-brown. The rust typically appears as small, scattered spots or streaks, often concentrated
            near imperfections or areas of previous contamination. It does NOT form directly from the glass itself, but from
            external iron sources.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, localized to areas of iron contamination. Often found near scratches, edges,
            or areas where iron-containing solutions have been deposited.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas of surface imperfection over the center of flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry influences the accumulation of moisture and iron particles. Concave surfaces
            and crevices tend to accumulate more rust than convex surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of iron-containing solutions, resulting in vertical streaking and
            pooling at the bottom of surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Generally matte, with minimal sheen. The color intensity varies depending on the angle of incidence
            of light.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and loosely adhered, becoming more crusty and adherent with age. Microscopic
            examination reveals a porous, heterogeneous structure composed of iron oxide particles.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-10 micrometers in early stages, potentially reaching 50-100 micrometers
            in heavily corroded areas over extended periods.
          typical_formations: Drip marks, pools (if liquid iron source is present), thin films, crusts, and small, raised
            patches.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated specks to small, concentrated patches. Never perfectly
            uniform.
        brass:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a thin, easily removable layer of reddish-orange powder. Aged
            rust (months/years) becomes darker, more consolidated, and harder to remove, often forming a thicker, more adherent
            crust.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial formation (hours/days): Thin, reddish-orange film. Intermediate (weeks/months): Development
            of localized spots and patches. Advanced (months/years): Thickening of rust layers, formation of crusts, and potential
            pitting corrosion.'
          color_variations:
          - '#A52A2A rust-brown (initial)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange (moderate)'
          - '#8B4513 dark-brown (advanced)'
          - '#D2691E reddish-brown (hydrated)'
          - '#F08080 light-coral (early stages, thin film)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, irregular patches, streaks (if moisture runs down the surface), and pitting around
            the rust spots.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture
            and contaminants accumulate. Flat surfaces may exhibit lighter, more scattered rust spots.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (>60%) coverage is rare unless the brass
            is heavily contaminated with iron or exposed to extremely corrosive conditions.
          description: Rust formation on brass is typically localized due to iron contamination or galvanic corrosion. It
            appears as reddish-brown spots and patches, often concentrated around imperfections or areas of moisture accumulation.
            The rust is not directly from the brass itself, but from iron particles on the surface.
          distribution_patterns: Localized corrosion cells, often around scratches, dents, or areas where iron particles have
            settled. Galvanic corrosion near dissimilar metal junctions.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture and contaminants. The center
            of flat surfaces may exhibit isolated spots.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased surface area and potential
            for moisture retention. Recessed areas are also prone to rust formation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity can cause rust particles to flow downwards, creating streaks and elongated patches, especially
            in humid environments or during rain events. Pooling can occur in horizontal crevices.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can have a slightly dull sheen, especially if compacted.
            No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, becoming more crusty and adherent with time. Can exhibit a
            slightly rough texture due to the accumulation of corrosion products.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial film) to 100 micrometers (thick, aged crusts).
          typical_formations: Small, raised patches, drip marks (if exposed to rain or condensation), and thin films spreading
            from the initial corrosion site. Pitting corrosion underneath the rust layer.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rust formation is rarely uniform on brass due to the localized nature of
            the corrosion process.
        breccia:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light orange dusting. Aged rust (months/years) forms a darker,
            thicker, and more consolidated crust, often with a reddish-brown hue and potential for hydrated iron oxides (limonite).
          buildup_progression: 'Initial dusting (hours): fine, powdery orange. Thin film formation (days): light orange-pink
            coating. Spot formation (weeks): localized reddish-brown spots. Crust formation (months): thicker, consolidated
            crusts. Hydration (years): darker brown, potentially sticky hydrated iron oxides.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (fresh)'
          - '#E07A5F burnt sienna (intermediate)'
          - '#CD5C5C indian red (moderate)'
          - '#A52A2A brown (aged)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle brown (very aged, hydrated)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around iron-rich clasts, streaks down vertical surfaces due to water runoff, and
            pooling in depressions. The matrix often shows a more uniform, diffuse staining.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration occurs at edges and corners of clasts, within crevices and pores,
            and on surfaces exposed to prolonged moisture. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more even, but thinner, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage ranges from sparse (<10%) in dry environments with low iron content to extreme (>85%)
            in highly humid environments with abundant iron-bearing minerals.
          description: 'Rust formation on breccia manifests as a heterogeneous coating, ranging from sparse orange spotting
            to extensive reddish-brown crusts. The breccia''s angular clasts and porous matrix create varied microclimates,
            leading to uneven oxidation. Dominant colors are #A52A2A (brown) and #E07A5F (burnt sienna).'
          distribution_patterns: Primarily follows the distribution of iron-bearing minerals within the breccia. Concentrated
            around metallic inclusions, along grain boundaries, and within the porous matrix.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners of clasts due to increased exposure and surface area. Centers of
            flat clast surfaces may exhibit a thinner, more uniform coating.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners of angular clasts act as nucleation sites for rust formation due to increased
            surface area and exposure to environmental factors. Concave surfaces trap moisture, promoting localized oxidation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to vertical streaking of rust. Pooling occurs
            in depressions and horizontal surfaces. Runoff from iron-rich areas stains lower surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As the rust ages and consolidates, it can develop a slight
            sheen, especially when hydrated. No significant iridescence is observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the rust is powdery and fine-grained. With time and moisture, it becomes crusty and
            somewhat crystalline, exhibiting micro-scale roughness. Hydrated forms can be slightly sticky.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from 1-10 micrometers (initial dusting) to 50-500 micrometers (thick crusts).
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical faces, small pools in depressions, thin films on smooth surfaces, and
            thicker crusts in areas of prolonged moisture exposure. Patches of varying size and thickness are common.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Rust formation is rarely uniform due to the heterogeneous composition and
            texture of breccia. It ranges from almost perfectly uniform on individual clast surfaces to highly variable across
            the entire sample.
        brick:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery coating with a pinkish or light orange hue.
            Aged rust (months/years) becomes darker, more consolidated, and often exhibits a crusty or layered structure,
            sometimes incorporating dirt and other environmental contaminants.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial staining (hours/days): thin, powdery film. Moderate staining (weeks/months): visible
            patches and streaks. Advanced staining (months/years): thick, crusty deposits and significant discoloration. Severe
            staining (years/decades): extensive alteration of the brick surface and potential structural damage.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (initial)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange (moderate)'
          - '#A04000 reddish-brown (advanced)'
          - '#800000 dark-brown (severe)'
          - '#463E3F blackish-brown (very aged, potentially mixed with other deposits)'
          common_patterns: Streaks running down the brick face (especially below metal fixtures), localized spots around embedded
            iron particles, diffuse staining across the brick surface, and concentrated deposits in mortar joints.
          concentration_variations: Heavy concentration near iron sources (e.g., embedded nails, metal flashing), edges of
            bricks, corners, and crevices where moisture accumulates. Lighter concentration on flat, exposed surfaces.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) - isolated spots; light (10-30%) - diffuse staining; moderate (30-60%) - noticeable
            patches and streaks; heavy (60-85%) - significant discoloration; extreme (>85%) - extensive crusting and alteration
            of the brick surface.
          description: Rust on brick manifests as reddish-brown discoloration, ranging from subtle staining to thick, crusty
            deposits. The color and texture vary depending on the iron source, moisture levels, and exposure time, often appearing
            as streaks or localized patches. It typically starts as a light surface stain and progresses to a more substantial
            buildup over time.
          distribution_patterns: Streaks, spots, patches, diffuse staining, concentrated deposits in mortar joints, halo effects
            around iron sources.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and corners initially due to increased exposure to moisture and oxygen. Can
            spread to the center of the brick face as the rust progresses.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities (e.g., grooves, pores) promote rust accumulation by trapping moisture and
            providing nucleation sites. Edges and corners are more susceptible due to increased exposure to moisture and oxygen.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes rust-laden water to flow downwards, resulting in vertical streaking patterns.
            Pooling occurs in horizontal crevices and depressions.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As the rust layer thickens and consolidates, it may develop
            a slight sheen. Under direct sunlight, the reddish-brown hues are more pronounced, while under diffuse lighting,
            the rust appears darker and less vibrant.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine, becoming increasingly rough, crusty, and sometimes flaky as the rust
            layer thickens. Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with crystalline formations in advanced stages.
            Can also be smooth and glossy if mixed with other materials.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial staining) to 500 micrometers (thick, advanced deposits).
            In extreme cases, crusts can reach up to 2 millimeters.
          typical_formations: Drip marks (streaks), pools (in depressions), thin films (initial staining), crusts (advanced
            stages), patches (localized corrosion).
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from perfectly uniform (thin film) to highly variable (localized
            deposits and streaks).
        bronze:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a loosely adherent, bright orange-red powder. Aged rust (months/years)
            becomes darker, more compact, and firmly attached, often exhibiting a dark brown or almost black coloration.
          buildup_progression: Initial formation (hours/days) starts as a thin, powdery layer. Over weeks/months, this layer
            thickens and becomes more adherent. After years, the rust transforms into a dense, crusty layer that is difficult
            to remove without damaging the underlying bronze.
          color_variations:
          - '#A04000 rust-red'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown'
          - '#654321 dark-brown'
          - '#4A3000 dark-chocolate'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks running downwards due to gravity, and accumulation in crevices or areas
            where moisture tends to collect. Uniform coating is rare unless the entire surface is heavily contaminated with
            iron.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are typically found at edges, corners, crevices, and areas where
            water tends to pool or run. Flat, exposed surfaces generally exhibit lighter rust coverage.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage are
            rare and indicate severe iron contamination or prolonged exposure to harsh conditions.
          description: Rust on bronze manifests as reddish-brown to dark brown iron oxide deposits, often appearing as localized
            spots or streaks rather than a uniform coating. The presence of moisture and iron contaminants are crucial for
            its formation, leading to aesthetically undesirable but structurally insignificant surface alterations.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, with preferential formation at points of iron contamination, scratches, or areas
            retaining moisture. Often observed around iron fasteners or where iron tools have contacted the bronze surface.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas of surface imperfection, rather than uniform distribution or concentration
            at the center of a surface.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased surface area and potential
            for moisture retention. Recessed areas and crevices provide sheltered environments conducive to rust formation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of rust, leading to downward flow patterns
            and the formation of streaks. Pooling of water at the base of vertical surfaces can result in concentrated rust
            deposits.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte appearance due to its powdery nature. Aged rust can display a slight
            sheen, especially if compacted or partially polished. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and slightly rough, transitioning to a more crusty and adherent texture with
            age. Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with varying degrees of crystallinity depending on environmental
            conditions.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1-50 micrometers, but can reach up to 100 micrometers in areas of heavy accumulation
            or prolonged exposure to moisture and iron contaminants.
          typical_formations: Drip marks from water runoff carrying dissolved iron, small pools of rust accumulating in depressions,
            thin films covering localized areas, and crusty patches forming in areas of prolonged moisture exposure.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from almost no rust to heavy localized deposits. Perfectly uniform
            rust coverage is extremely rare on bronze.
        calcite:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light orange-red powder. Aged rust (months/years) darkens
            to a deep brown or almost black, forming a more consolidated and adherent crust.
          buildup_progression: Initial buildup (hours/days) involves the formation of a thin, powdery layer of orange-red
            rust. Over weeks/months, this layer thickens and darkens, becoming more consolidated. After years, a thick, dark
            brown or black crust can form, potentially altering the calcite's surface texture.
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 salmon'
          - '#B87333 copper'
          - '#A0522D sienna'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown'
          - '#654321 darkbrown'
          common_patterns: Localized spots, streaks following water flow, drip marks, and general surface discoloration. The
            patterns are often influenced by the calcite's surface texture and porosity.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are often found along edges, corners, and within crevices where
            moisture and iron-rich particles tend to accumulate. Flat surfaces may exhibit a more even, but lighter, coating.
          coverage_ranges: Coverage can range from sparse (<10%) in areas with minimal iron exposure to extreme (>85%) in
            areas with heavy contamination and prolonged moisture.
          description: Rust formation on calcite manifests as reddish-brown to dark brown discoloration, often appearing as
            localized spots or streaks. The iron oxide typically forms a powdery or crusty layer, varying in thickness and
            coverage depending on environmental conditions and iron source proximity.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform distribution is common, with rust concentrated in areas where iron-rich solutions
            have been deposited or where moisture accumulates.
          edge_center_behavior: Often prefers edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture and airborne iron particles.
            Centers of flat surfaces may exhibit lower concentrations unless directly exposed to iron-rich solutions.
          geometry_effects: Surface irregularities, such as cracks and pores, act as nucleation sites for rust formation,
            leading to higher concentrations in these areas. Sloping surfaces promote runoff and streaking.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of rust, leading to downward flow patterns,
            pooling at the base of surfaces, and vertical streaking.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. Aged rust can develop a slight sheen due to the formation
            of denser oxide layers. No iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, transitioning to a crusty, sometimes slightly crystalline texture
            with increased exposure and oxidation. The surface can feel rough and uneven to the touch.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 50 micrometers, but can reach several millimeters in areas of heavy
            accumulation.
          typical_formations: Drip marks from iron-rich water runoff, small pools of rust accumulating in depressions, thin
            films covering larger areas, and thicker crusts forming in areas of prolonged exposure.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from almost perfectly uniform thin films in some areas to highly
            localized and concentrated deposits in others.
        carbon fiber reinforced polymer:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery coating. Aged rust (months/years) becomes a
            darker, thicker, and more consolidated crust, often exhibiting flaking or spalling.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial formation (hours/days): fine, powdery rust spots. Early buildup (weeks): expansion
            of rust spots and formation of streaks. Advanced buildup (months): thickening of rust layer, formation of crusts,
            and potential for flaking. Severe buildup (years): extensive corrosion and potential structural damage to the
            CFRP.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 rust-pink (initial)'
          - '#E07A5F salmon-rust (early)'
          - '#CD5C5C indian-red (moderate)'
          - '#B83F09 burnt-sienna (advanced)'
          - '#8B0000 dark-red (severe)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around exposed iron particles, streaks along scratches or damage lines, and drip
            marks where moisture has carried dissolved iron.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture tends to accumulate.
            Lighter concentrations on flat, exposed surfaces due to easier drying.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) in initial stages, progressing to light (10-30%) and potentially moderate (30-60%)
            in severe cases, but rarely exceeding heavy (60-85%) on the entire CFRP surface unless the underlying metallic
            component is extensively corroded.
          description: Rust formation on CFRP is typically localized around exposed iron particles or areas where the carbon
            fiber matrix has been compromised, revealing underlying metallic components. The rust appears as reddish-brown
            spots or streaks, often concentrated near edges or areas of mechanical damage, contrasting sharply with the dark
            carbon fiber.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around areas of exposed iron or damage to the CFRP matrix. Can also spread
            along fiber bundles or resin cracks.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas of damage over the center of flat surfaces due to increased exposure
            and potential for mechanical abrasion.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners promote rust formation due to increased exposure to moisture and potential
            for mechanical damage. Concave surfaces trap moisture, accelerating corrosion.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes dissolved iron to flow downwards, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at lower points on the surface.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As the rust layer thickens, it retains a matte appearance,
            but may develop a slight sheen in areas where the rust particles are more densely packed and compacted.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine, becoming increasingly crusty and granular as the rust layer thickens.
            The surface transitions from slightly rough to distinctly rough with visible particulate matter.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial formation) to 100 micrometers (advanced corrosion),
            with localized areas potentially reaching up to 500 micrometers.
          typical_formations: Drip marks from water runoff, small pools in depressions, thin films on flat surfaces, and thicker
            crusts around points of origin.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated spots to interconnected patches. Not uniform across
            the entire surface.
        carbon steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days old) appears as a thin, bright orange-red film. Aged rust (months/years
            old) becomes darker, thicker, and more textured. The color shifts to dark brown or black, and the texture evolves
            from powdery to crusty. The rust layer can become significantly thicker over time, potentially leading to structural
            weakening of the steel.
          buildup_progression: Rust buildup starts as a thin film of orange-red iron oxide, typically within hours of exposure
            to moisture and oxygen. It begins at contact points with moisture or at edges and scratches. Over days, the rust
            spreads outwards from these points, thickening and darkening in color. Over months, the rust layer becomes significantly
            thicker, forming a crusty layer that can flake off. Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity can accelerate
            or decelerate the corrosion process.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh Rust: Bright orange-red (similar to brick red). 2. Developing Rust: Rust-orange with
            brown edges. 3. Moderate Rust: Reddish-brown with darker brown patches. 4. Advanced Rust: Dark brown, almost black
            in heavily corroded areas. 5. Hydrated Rust: Yellowish-brown, often indicating the presence of moisture.'
          common_patterns: Rust typically initiates at points of weakness or damage in the steel's protective coating (if
            any), such as scratches, welds, or edges. It then spreads outwards from these points. On flat surfaces, it can
            form a relatively uniform coating or develop in localized spots. On vertical surfaces, gravity causes drip marks
            and streaks. Crevices and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to moisture retention.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices due to increased moisture
            retention and exposure to corrosive agents. Top surfaces exposed to rain may experience more uniform rust, while
            sheltered areas may have less. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient with heavier rust at the bottom due to gravity-driven
            accumulation of moisture and dissolved iron.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10%): Isolated spots of orange-red rust, primarily at edges or defects. Thickness:
            <1 µm. 2. Light (10-30%): Scattered patches of rust, with some areas still showing bare steel. Color: Orange-red
            to rust-orange. Thickness: 1-10 µm. 3. Moderate (30-60%): Significant rust coverage, with a mix of rust and bare
            steel. Color: Rust-orange to reddish-brown. Thickness: 10-100 µm. 4. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete rust coverage,
            with only small areas of bare steel visible. Color: Reddish-brown to dark brown. Thickness: 100 µm - 1 mm. 5.
            Extreme (>85%): Complete rust coverage, with a thick, flaky crust. Color: Dark brown to black. Thickness: >1 mm.'
          description: Rust on carbon steel presents as a reddish-brown to dark brown surface discoloration. The texture ranges
            from a fine powdery coating to a thick, flaky crust, depending on the age and severity of the corrosion. Coverage
            can vary from isolated spots to complete surface encasement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Localized spots around scratches or defects. 2.
            Uniform coating on exposed surfaces. 3. Edge accumulation due to higher exposure to moisture and oxygen. 4. Streaks
            and drip marks on vertical surfaces. 5. Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with varying levels of exposure. 6.
            Gradient from source of corrosion (e.g., a weld).'
          edge_center_behavior: Rust preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased exposure to moisture, oxygen, and
            other corrosive agents. The edges are often the first points of attack, leading to a higher concentration of rust
            compared to the center areas. This is especially true for cut edges or areas where protective coatings are damaged.
          geometry_effects: Rust accumulates in corners and crevices due to moisture trapping. It builds up on flat areas
            where water can pool. On vertical surfaces, it drips downwards. Edges are particularly susceptible due to increased
            exposure. The rust follows contours and can bridge small gaps as it expands.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly influences the distribution. It causes downward flow of moisture and dissolved
            iron, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common result.
            Rust particles also settle on horizontal surfaces, contributing to a more uniform coating.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh rust can exhibit a slight sheen due to its fine particle size. As
            it ages and becomes more textured, the surface becomes matte. Hydrated rust may appear slightly glossy when wet.
            No significant iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture varies greatly. Fresh rust can be powdery and easily brushed off. As it ages, it becomes
            more adherent and forms a rough, granular surface. Advanced rust often develops a flaky, layered crust that is
            brittle and easily chipped. Hydrated rust can be sticky or damp to the touch. At a microscopic level, crystalline
            structures may be visible.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a thin film to several millimeters (mm) for heavy
            buildup. A thin film might be 1-5 µm, while a heavy crust can be 1-5 mm or even thicker in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films of initial rust. 2. Thick crusts of advanced corrosion.
            3. Drip marks and runs on vertical surfaces. 4. Discrete patches around points of origin. 5. Spots/dots of localized
            corrosion. 6. Stains spreading from corroded areas. 7. Buildups in crevices and corners.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            rust distribution is rare in real-world industrial settings. Variations are caused by differences in surface preparation,
            exposure to environmental factors (moisture, oxygen, pollutants), and the presence of surface defects.
        cast iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) is typically a bright orange-red, powdery, and easily removed. Aged rust
            (months/years) darkens to a deep reddish-brown or almost black, becomes more firmly adhered, and develops a thicker,
            crustier texture. It may also exhibit signs of flaking or delamination.
          buildup_progression: 'Rust buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin film of bright orange-red rust at
            microscopic imperfections or scratches (hours). 2. Begins at contact points with moisture or contaminants and
            spreads outward, forming small spots (days). 3. Starts at edges and moves inward, gradually covering the surface
            (weeks). 4. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on exposed surfaces, thickening the rust layer (months). 5. Point
            sources expand outward, merging with other rust patches to form larger areas of corrosion (months). 6. Layering
            effects can occur due to seasonal variations in humidity and temperature, creating distinct bands of rust with
            different colors and textures (years).'
          color_variations: '1. Fresh Rust: Bright orange-red (similar to burnt sienna). 2. Developing Rust: Rust-orange with
            brown edges, transitioning to a more uniform reddish-brown. 3. Mature Rust: Dark reddish-brown, almost chocolate
            brown in thicker areas. 4. Advanced Rust: Dark brown with black undertones, indicating the presence of magnetite
            (Fe3O4) or other complex iron oxides. 5. Weathered Rust: Dull, muted brown with a slightly grayish cast due to
            surface leaching and environmental interaction.'
          common_patterns: Rust commonly forms localized spots and patches, especially around edges, corners, and crevices
            where moisture tends to accumulate. It also appears as streaks or drip marks on vertical surfaces due to water
            runoff. On flat surfaces, it can create a more uniform coating, but often with variations in thickness and color.
          concentration_variations: Concentration varies significantly. Edges, corners, and crevices tend to have heavier
            rust accumulation due to moisture retention and increased surface area. Top surfaces exposed to direct rainfall
            may exhibit more rust than sheltered undersides. Vertical walls often show drip marks with higher rust concentration
            at the bottom. Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate a more uniform layer, but with thicker buildup in low-lying
            areas.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Scattered spots of bright orange-red rust, typically very thin (1-5
            micrometers). 2. Light (10-30%): More numerous spots and small patches, with a slightly darker orange-brown color
            (5-20 micrometers). 3. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage with interconnected patches, exhibiting a reddish-brown
            color and a slightly rougher texture (20-100 micrometers). 4. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a
            dark reddish-brown to brown color, a crusty texture, and noticeable thickness (100-500 micrometers). 5. Extreme
            (>85%): Complete encasement in a thick, dark brown to black rust layer, often with flaking and delamination (500
            micrometers - 5 millimeters or more).'
          description: Rust on cast iron manifests as a reddish-brown to dark brown layer, often with a rough, uneven texture.
            The coverage can range from sparse spotting to complete encasement, depending on the exposure and duration of
            oxidation. It typically starts in areas with imperfections or moisture accumulation.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1. Edge accumulation (due to higher surface energy
            and moisture retention). 2. Point source spreading (originating from a scratch or imperfection). 3. Gradient from
            source (decreasing rust concentration away from the initial corrosion site). 4. Patchy/spotty (uneven coverage
            due to variations in surface condition). 5. Streaky/linear (caused by water runoff). 6. Localized concentrations
            (in crevices and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Rust preferentially accumulates at edges due to higher surface energy, increased exposure
            to moisture, and potential for galvanic corrosion if dissimilar metals are present. The edges act as initiation
            sites for corrosion, leading to faster rust formation compared to the center areas. While the center can also
            rust, the process is typically slower unless there are pre-existing imperfections or damage.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Rust accumulates in corners and builds up
            in crevices due to moisture trapping. It pools on flat areas where water can collect. It drips on vertical surfaces,
            creating streaks. It collects at edges due to higher surface energy. It follows contours, mirroring the shape
            of the underlying cast iron. It can bridge gaps and fill depressions over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks from top to bottom. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common
            due to water runoff. Rust settles on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker accumulation. Runs down slopes, creating
            visible trails. Can hang from overhead surfaces as fragile crusts.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh rust can appear slightly glossy due to light reflecting off the powdery
            surface. As it ages and becomes more porous, the finish becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to mute
            the colors, making the rust appear less vibrant. No significant iridescence is typically observed, unless there
            are oil contaminants present.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and easily brushed off when fresh, to a more adherent, crusty,
            and sometimes flaky texture as it ages. Close inspection reveals a granular or porous structure. It feels rough
            to the touch, with varying degrees of coarseness depending on the rust's age and thickness. In advanced stages,
            it can become quite brittle and easily crumble.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 micrometers) in early stages to a heavy buildup (1-5 millimeters
            or more) in advanced corrosion. Extremely heavy buildup can reach several centimeters in severe cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (early stages). 2. Thick crusts (advanced corrosion).
            3. Discrete patches (localized corrosion). 4. Spots/dots (initial corrosion sites). 5. Stains (discoloration from
            rust runoff). 6. Drip marks (vertical streaks from water flow). 7. Buildups (accumulation in corners and crevices).
            Crystalline structures are not typically visible to the naked eye, but can be observed under magnification.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare due to variations in surface preparation, environmental exposure, and the presence of imperfections.
            The uniformity level is primarily influenced by the homogeneity of the cast iron surface and the consistency of
            the corrosive environment.
        cedar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light, powdery coating with a reddish hue. Aged rust (months/years)
            becomes darker, thicker, and more firmly adhered, often forming a crusty or flaky layer.
          buildup_progression: Initial discoloration (hours/days), powdery coating (days/weeks), thickening and crust formation
            (weeks/months), and eventual flaking and delamination (months/years). The rate of buildup is highly dependent
            on environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, rainfall) and the proximity to iron sources.
          color_variations:
          - '#A52A2A rust-brown (initial)'
          - '#B87333 reddish-brown (moderate)'
          - '#8B4513 dark-brown (advanced)'
          - '#CD5C5C salmon-red (early, thin)'
          - '#5C4033 dark-chocolate (aged, dense)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around fasteners (nails, screws), streaks running downwards from metal components,
            and diffuse patches where iron-rich water has spread across the cedar surface.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations occur near metal fasteners, edges where water accumulates, and
            in crevices where debris collects. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, exposed surfaces away from iron sources.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to moderate (30-60%) is most common. Heavy (60-85%) and extreme (>85%) coverage is
            rare and typically only occurs in areas with prolonged exposure to iron-rich water and debris.
          description: Rust formation on cedar presents as localized patches and streaks of reddish-brown to dark brown discoloration.
            The initial formation often appears as a fine, powdery coating, evolving into a more crusty and textured surface
            over time. The dominant colors are variations of red and brown, influenced by the iron source and environmental
            conditions.
          distribution_patterns: Non-uniform, concentrated around iron sources (nails, screws, flashing). Follows grain patterns
            of the cedar, creating streaks and uneven patches.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas around fasteners. Centers of large, flat surfaces are less prone to
            rust formation unless directly exposed to iron contamination.
          geometry_effects: Edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased water retention and debris collection.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit downward streaking due to gravity.
          gravity_influence: Significant. Gravity causes dissolved iron to flow downwards, resulting in vertical streaks and
            the accumulation of rust at the bottom of vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As the rust layer thickens and becomes more crystalline, it
            may develop a slight sheen under direct light. Heavily rusted areas tend to be matte.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, transitioning to rough, crusty, and sometimes flaky as the
            rust layer thickens. Microscopic examination reveals crystalline structures interspersed with amorphous iron oxide
            particles.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 micrometer (initial layer) to 500 micrometers (advanced, thick crusts).
            Localized buildup can reach up to 1-2 millimeters near metal sources.
          typical_formations: Drip marks running vertically down the cedar, pools of rust accumulating in low-lying areas,
            thin films spreading outwards from metal components, and thick, crusty patches around fasteners.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from sparse, isolated spots to dense, continuous coatings depending
            on the proximity to the iron source and the extent of water exposure.
        cement:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust appears as a light orange stain, easily wiped away. Over time, it darkens to a deep
            reddish-brown, becomes more adherent, and forms thicker, more textured deposits. Very old rust can become almost
            black and extremely difficult to remove.
          buildup_progression: 'Initial staining (hours/days): faint orange discoloration. Early rust (weeks/months): localized
            spots and streaks, light orange-brown color. Mature rust (months/years): thicker, flaky deposits, reddish-brown
            color. Advanced rust (years/decades): dark brown to black, heavily textured, significant cement degradation.'
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 salmon (fresh, thin film)'
          - '#E07A5F burnt-sienna (early stage, moderate thickness)'
          - '#B7410E rust-orange (typical, mature rust)'
          - '#8B4513 saddle-brown (aged, dehydrated rust)'
          - '#4A3020 dark-brown (heavily corroded, mixed with cement particles)'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around embedded metal fragments, streaks from water runoff, drip marks below corroding
            fixtures, and general discoloration of porous areas. Often concentrated near cracks and joints.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations typically occur at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture
            tends to accumulate. Lighter concentrations are found on flat, exposed surfaces due to faster drying and less
            iron source proximity.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) to extreme (>85%), depending on the severity of the corrosion and the extent of iron
            contamination. Light (10-30%) and moderate (30-60%) are most common in early to mid-stage corrosion.
          description: Rust formation on cement manifests as reddish-brown discoloration, ranging from subtle staining to
            thick, flaky deposits. The color and texture vary depending on the iron source, environmental conditions, and
            age of the corrosion. It often appears as localized spots or streaks, following the path of water runoff.
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around the source of iron contamination (e.g., rebar, metal fixtures).
            Follows moisture paths, concentrating in areas where water accumulates or flows. Can also be dispersed by wind
            and rain.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas near the iron source. Edges tend to accumulate moisture and dissolved
            iron, promoting rust formation. Center areas are generally less affected unless the entire surface is porous and
            contaminated.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry dictates water flow, leading to rust concentration in low-lying areas and along
            edges. Vertical surfaces exhibit streaking due to gravity-driven runoff.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of iron-rich water, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at the base of vertical surfaces. Rust deposits are often thicker at the bottom of walls and columns.
          lighting_effects: Fresh rust exhibits a matte finish. As it thickens, it can develop a slight sheen, especially
            when wet. Aged rust tends to be dull and non-reflective.
          texture_details: Initially smooth and powdery, transitioning to rough, flaky, and sometimes crusty as the rust thickens.
            Microscopic examination reveals a porous structure with crystalline formations of iron oxides and hydroxides.
            Can also be sticky when wet.
          thickness_range: From <1 micrometer (initial staining) to 500 micrometers - 2 millimeters (thick, layered deposits).
          typical_formations: Drip marks below corroding metal objects, pools in depressions, thin films on porous surfaces,
            crusts around the base of metal fixtures, and irregular patches where iron-rich water has spread.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable. Ranges from perfectly uniform thin films to highly localized and uneven
            deposits.
        ceramic matrix composites cmcs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a light salmon (#F08080) dusting. Aged rust (months/years) darkens
            to a deep brown (#8B4513) and becomes more consolidated, forming a thicker, crustier layer.
          buildup_progression: Initial dusting (hours/days), localized spot formation (days/weeks), film formation along cracks
            (weeks/months), crust formation and thickening (months/years). The rate of buildup is highly dependent on environmental
            conditions (humidity, temperature, salt concentration).
          color_variations:
          - '#F08080 salmon'
          - '#CD5C5C indianred'
          - '#A52A2A brown'
          - '#8B4513 saddlebrown'
          - '#654321 chocolate'
          common_patterns: Localized spots around fiber ends, streaks along crack lines in the matrix, and occasional drip
            marks on vertical surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Heavier concentrations are observed at edges, corners, and within crevices where moisture
            tends to accumulate. Flat surfaces generally exhibit lighter, more dispersed rust formation.
          coverage_ranges: Sparse (<10%) initially, progressing to light (10-30%) after several weeks, and potentially reaching
            moderate (30-60%) after prolonged exposure (months/years) in highly corrosive environments. Extreme coverage (>85%)
            is unlikely under typical operating conditions.
          description: 'Rust formation on CMCs manifests as localized, reddish-brown (primarily #A52A2A) spots and thin films,
            often concentrated at exposed fiber ends or matrix cracks. The coverage is typically sparse to light initially,
            increasing with prolonged exposure to humid environments. The rust appears as a powdery or slightly crusty deposit.'
          distribution_patterns: Primarily localized around exposed fibers, matrix cracks, and edges of the CMC component.
            Non-uniform distribution is typical due to variations in surface reactivity and moisture exposure.
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and areas surrounding exposed fibers, with the center regions of flat surfaces
            exhibiting less rust formation.
          geometry_effects: Sharp edges and corners tend to accumulate more rust due to increased surface area and potential
            for moisture retention. Concave surfaces may also exhibit higher rust concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity contributes to downward flow of moisture, resulting in vertical streaking and pooling
            at lower points on the CMC component.
          lighting_effects: Initially matte, becoming slightly more reflective with increased consolidation and thickness.
            No significant iridescence observed.
          texture_details: Initially powdery and fine-grained, transitioning to a slightly crusty and porous texture with
            increased oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals individual iron oxide particles ranging from 0.1 to 5 micrometers
            in size.
          thickness_range: Typically ranges from 1 to 20 micrometers, with thicker accumulations (up to 50 micrometers) in
            areas of high moisture exposure or around pre-existing defects.
          typical_formations: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, small pools within surface depressions, thin films covering
            exposed fibers, and localized crusts around areas of concentrated oxidation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable, ranging from isolated spots to patchy coverage. Perfect uniformity is not
            observed.
        iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a thin, bright orange film that is easily disturbed. Aged rust
            (months/years) becomes darker, thicker, and more firmly adhered to the surface. The texture becomes increasingly
            rough and flaky, and the rust layer can develop significant thickness, potentially leading to structural weakening
            of the iron.
          buildup_progression: Rust buildup starts as a thin, bright orange film at points of weakness (scratches, edges)
            within hours of exposure to moisture and oxygen. Over days, these spots expand and darken. After a few weeks,
            the rust layer thickens and becomes more reddish-brown. Over months, the rust continues to accumulate, becoming
            increasingly flaky and crusty. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal variations in humidity and temperature,
            leading to alternating layers of different colors and textures.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh Rust: Bright rust-orange with hints of red. 2. Developing Rust: A mix of rust-orange
            and reddish-brown. 3. Mature Rust: Dark reddish-brown with some areas tending towards a chocolate brown. 4. Advanced
            Rust: Dark brown to almost black, especially in areas with heavy buildup. 5. Hydrated Rust (Lepidocrocite/Goethite):
            Yellowish-brown to ochre, often appearing as a slimy or wet layer.'
          common_patterns: Rust typically starts at points of weakness or high stress, such as edges, scratches, or welds.
            It then spreads outwards, forming localized spots or a more uniform coating. Drip marks and streaks are common
            on vertical surfaces. Accumulation is often heavier in crevices and areas where moisture tends to collect.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture
            and contaminants. Crevices and areas where water can pool also exhibit higher concentrations. Top surfaces exposed
            to rain may have lighter rust concentrations than sheltered areas where moisture lingers longer. Vertical walls
            will show a gradient with heavier rust at the bottom due to runoff.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of bright orange rust, typically very thin. 2. Light
            (10-30%): More numerous spots, with some beginning to merge. The rust layer is still thin and powdery. 3. Moderate
            (30-60%): Significant coverage with a mix of orange and reddish-brown rust. The texture is becoming rougher. 4.
            Heavy (60-85%): Extensive coverage with a dark reddish-brown color. The rust layer is thick and flaky. 5. Extreme
            (>85%): Nearly complete encrustation with a dark brown to black color. The rust layer is very thick and may be
            structurally unsound.'
          description: Rust, or Iron Oxide Formation, on iron surfaces presents as a reddish-brown to dark brown layer, often
            with a rough, flaky texture. The coverage can range from sparse spotting to complete encrustation, depending on
            exposure and time.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Localized spots around scratches or imperfections.
            2. Uniform coating on exposed surfaces. 3. Edge accumulation along cut edges or welds. 4. Streaky/linear patterns
            on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 5. Patchy/spotty distribution where the protective coating has been
            compromised. 6. Gradient from a point source of contamination (e.g., a leaking pipe).'
          edge_center_behavior: Rust preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased exposure to moisture, mechanical
            damage to protective coatings, and the presence of stress concentrations. The edges are often the first points
            of failure for protective coatings, allowing corrosion to initiate and spread inwards.
          geometry_effects: Rust accumulates in corners and crevices due to moisture retention. It builds up in crevices and
            around fasteners. On flat areas, it can form pools of hydrated rust. On vertical surfaces, it drips and streaks
            downwards. It collects at edges where the protective coating is often thinnest or damaged. Rust can bridge small
            gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of moisture, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks
            from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Rust particles settle
            on horizontal surfaces, leading to heavier accumulation. Runs develop down slopes, and rust can hang from overhead
            surfaces in extreme cases. The angle of the surface directly influences the rate and direction of rust propagation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh rust can exhibit a slight sheen due to its fine particulate nature.
            As rust ages and thickens, the surface becomes more matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the
            reddish-brown hues. Hydrated rust can appear slightly glossy or wet under any lighting condition.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and easily brushed off in early stages to rough, flaky, and crusty
            in later stages. It feels gritty and uneven to the touch. Close inspection may reveal a layered structure, especially
            in areas of heavy buildup. In humid conditions, it can feel slightly damp or sticky.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a thin film to several millimeters (mm) for heavy
            buildup. A light dusting might be <50 µm, while a heavily corroded area can easily exceed 2-3 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films covering the surface. 2. Thick crusts in areas of
            heavy corrosion. 3. Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4. Discrete patches of rust where the protective
            coating has failed. 5. Spots/dots indicating initial corrosion points. 6. Buildups along edges and welds. 7. Stains
            spreading from corrosion sites.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the entire surface is consistently exposed to the same corrosive environment. Variations
            are caused by differences in surface preparation, exposure to moisture, and the presence of contaminants.
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days old) is typically a bright orange, powdery film. Aged rust (months/years
            old) becomes darker, thicker, and more tightly bound to the steel. It develops a crusty or flaky texture and can
            exhibit significant volume expansion, leading to cracking and delamination of the rust layer. Very old rust can
            be almost black and extremely hard.
          buildup_progression: Rust buildup starts as a thin film of orange or reddish-brown oxide within hours of exposure
            to moisture and oxygen. It begins at contact points with moisture or contaminants and spreads outward. Over days,
            the film thickens and darkens. Over weeks and months, the rust layer becomes more substantial, developing a crusty
            or flaky texture. Layering effects can occur due to alternating wet and dry cycles. Seasonal variations in temperature
            and humidity can influence the rate of corrosion.
          color_variations: 'Fresh rust can appear as a bright rust-orange (RGB: 204, 51, 0). As it ages, it transitions to
            a reddish-brown (RGB: 153, 51, 0), then a dark brown with hints of black (RGB: 77, 38, 0). Heavily corroded areas
            may exhibit a near-black, almost charcoal-like color (RGB: 25, 25, 25). Some areas may show a yellowish-orange
            tint due to the presence of goethite (FeO(OH)).'
          common_patterns: Rust commonly forms localized spots, streaks (especially on vertical surfaces), and a general coating
            that may be uneven. It accumulates first at edges, welds, scratches, and areas where the protective coating (if
            any) is compromised. Crevices and areas with trapped moisture are also prime locations for rust formation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture and contaminants
            accumulate. The top of a horizontal surface may have heavier rust due to direct exposure to rain or condensation,
            while the bottom may be slightly less affected due to gravity. Vertical walls often show a gradient from top to
            bottom due to water runoff. Sheltered areas may have less rust than exposed areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of orange or reddish-brown rust, typically very thin (1-5
            µm). Light (10-30%): More widespread spots and patches, with some areas showing a thin film of rust (5-20 µm).
            Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage with a noticeable reddish-brown layer, potentially with some flaking (20-100
            µm). Heavy (60-85%): Extensive rust coverage with a thick, crusty layer and significant flaking (100 µm - 1 mm).
            Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete rust coverage with a very thick, heavily textured layer that is actively delaminating
            ( > 1 mm).'
          description: Rust on steel manifests as a reddish-brown to dark brown layer, often with a rough, uneven texture.
            It typically starts as localized spots and spreads, eventually covering larger areas of the steel surface. The
            coverage pattern is influenced by environmental factors and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Localized spots around scratches or defects. 2)
            Edge accumulation, especially at cut edges. 3) Streaky patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution where the protective coating is damaged. 5) Uniform coating if the entire surface is exposed to corrosive
            conditions. 6) Gradient from a point source, such as a weld. Localized concentrations around fasteners are also
            common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Rust preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased exposure to moisture, contaminants,
            and stress concentrations. Cut edges are particularly vulnerable. The center areas may corrode more slowly unless
            the protective coating is damaged or the surface is uniformly exposed to corrosive conditions. The perimeter often
            shows a higher concentration of rust than the center.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects rust distribution. Rust accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture trapping. It builds up in crevices and around fasteners. On flat areas, it may pool if water cannot
            drain. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Edges are particularly susceptible to corrosion due to increased exposure
            and stress concentrations. Rust follows contours and can bridge small gaps.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks from top to bottom. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common
            due to water runoff. Rust settles on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Overhead surfaces may exhibit
            hanging rust formations.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh rust may appear slightly glossy due to surface moisture. As it dries,
            it becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the reddish-brown tones. Heavily corroded areas
            may appear dull and absorb light. Iridescence is rare but possible in very thin films due to interference effects.
          texture_details: The texture ranges from powdery and easily brushed off when fresh, to a more adherent, crusty,
            and flaky texture as it ages. At a microscopic level, crystalline structures can be observed, particularly in
            thicker deposits. The surface feels rough and abrasive to the touch. Advanced rust can have a layered, exfoliating
            texture.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of a few micrometers (µm) to heavy buildup of several millimeters
            (mm). A freshly formed layer might be 1-10 µm thick, while advanced corrosion can result in layers exceeding 5
            mm in thickness.
          typical_formations: 'Rust forms various physical formations, including: 1) Thin films: initial layer of oxidation.
            2) Thick crusts: buildup of multiple layers of rust over time. 3) Discrete patches: localized areas of corrosion.
            4) Spots/dots: small, isolated rust formations. 5) Stains: discoloration of the steel surface. 6) Drip marks:
            streaks of rust running down vertical surfaces. 7) Buildups: accumulation of rust at edges or corners. 8) Runs/streaks:
            caused by water carrying dissolved iron oxides.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            rust distribution is rare unless the steel has been deliberately treated to induce uniform corrosion. The variability
            is caused by differences in surface preparation, exposure to moisture and contaminants, and the presence of defects
            or stress points in the steel.
        wrought iron:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rust (hours/days) appears as a thin, bright orange film. Aged rust (months/years) becomes
            darker, thicker, and more textured. The color shifts from orange to reddish-brown to dark brown or almost black.
            The texture evolves from powdery to crusty, and the rust layer can become detached from the underlying metal,
            forming flakes or scales.
          buildup_progression: Rust buildup typically starts as a thin film at points of contact with moisture or at defects
            in the protective coating. It then spreads outward from these points, forming localized spots. Over time, these
            spots merge and thicken, eventually forming a continuous layer. The process can be accelerated by seasonal variations
            in humidity and temperature. Layering effects can occur as new rust forms on top of older, more stable layers.
            The initial thin film can form within hours of exposure, while significant buildup can take months or years.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh Rust: Bright rust-orange (similar to Pantone 18-1354 TPX). 2. Developing Rust: Reddish-brown
            with hints of orange (Pantone 19-1350 TPX). 3. Mature Rust: Dark brown with reddish undertones (Pantone 19-1232
            TPX). 4. Aged Rust: Deep brown, almost black, with possible greyish patches where the oxide has been leached or
            altered (Pantone 19-0614 TPX). 5. Hydrated Rust: Yellowish-brown, often indicating the presence of goethite (α-FeOOH)
            (Pantone 16-0942 TPX).'
          common_patterns: Rust commonly forms localized spots or patches, especially around joints, welds, and areas where
            the original protective coating is damaged. It also tends to accumulate along edges and in crevices where moisture
            and contaminants can collect. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces due to water runoff.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on edges and in crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain may have less rust due to washing, while sheltered areas may retain moisture and
            exhibit heavier corrosion. Corners and areas around welds are often heavily affected. Vertical walls exhibit a
            gradient with heavier rust at the bottom due to water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Small, isolated spots of orange or reddish-brown rust, typically very
            thin (1-10 µm). 2. Light (10-30%): More numerous spots and patches, with some merging. The rust layer is still
            relatively thin (10-30 µm). 3. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage with interconnected patches and streaks.
            The rust layer is thicker and more textured (30-100 µm). 4. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick,
            crusty layer of rust. Significant pitting of the underlying metal may be visible (100-500 µm). 5. Extreme (>85%):
            Complete coverage with a very thick, scaly layer of rust. The original surface is often obscured, and structural
            integrity may be compromised (>500 µm).'
          description: Rust on wrought iron manifests as a reddish-brown to dark brown surface discoloration, often with a
            rough, uneven texture. The coverage can range from small, isolated spots to a complete coating, depending on the
            exposure and environmental conditions. It typically starts in areas with imperfections or damage to the protective
            coating.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Localized concentrations around scratches or defects
            (point source spreading). 2. Edge accumulation along corners and seams. 3. Streaky/linear patterns on vertical
            surfaces due to water runoff. 4. Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with varying exposure to moisture. 5. Gradient
            from source of corrosion (e.g., a weld).'
          edge_center_behavior: Rust preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to increased exposure to moisture
            and oxygen. Edges are also more susceptible to mechanical damage, which can compromise protective coatings. The
            center areas may be less affected initially, especially if they have a more intact protective layer.
          geometry_effects: Rust accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to moisture trapping. It pools on flat
            areas, especially if drainage is poor. On vertical surfaces, it drips and forms streaks. Edges and sharp corners
            are often the first points of attack due to increased exposure and stress concentrations. Rust can bridge small
            gaps and fill depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow of water carries dissolved iron
            and accelerates corrosion, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking
            is a direct result of gravity-driven water runoff. Rust particles settle on horizontal surfaces, contributing
            to buildup.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh rust can exhibit a slight sheen due to its fine particle size. As
            the rust ages and becomes more porous, the surface becomes matte. Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize
            the reddish tones. Hydrated rust (goethite) can sometimes show a subtle iridescence.
          texture_details: Initially, rust can feel slightly powdery or dusty. As it develops, the texture becomes rougher,
            more granular, and sometimes flaky. Heavily rusted areas can exhibit a crusty or scaly texture. Close inspection
            may reveal a porous structure with visible pitting of the underlying iron. It is generally brittle and easily
            crumbles when touched.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (µm) for a thin film to several millimeters (mm) for heavy
            buildup. A light surface rust might be 5-50 µm thick, while a heavily corroded area can reach 1-5 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films of surface rust. 2. Thick crusts of layered rust.
            3. Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 4. Discrete patches of rust around defects. 5. Buildups in
            crevices and corners. 6. Stains on adjacent surfaces caused by rust runoff.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            rust coverage is rare on wrought iron due to variations in surface condition, exposure, and the presence of protective
            coatings. The level of uniformity is influenced by the homogeneity of the iron itself and the consistency of environmental
            factors.

          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) is typically a thin, powdery film, nearly white in color.
            Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, harder, and often darker in color due to the incorporation
            of dirt, rust, and organic matter. The texture becomes more crusty and less easily removed.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure to hard water. It then thickens
            gradually over days and weeks. Buildup often begins at contact points (e.g., where a water droplet first lands)
            and spreads outward. Edges and crevices tend to accumulate deposits faster than flat surfaces. Layering effects
            can occur with seasonal variations in water hardness or usage patterns. Months of accumulation lead to visible
            crusts and significant thickness.
          color_variations: Fresh deposits are often near-white (#F8F8FF) or a very light gray (#D3D3D3). As they age and
            incorporate iron oxides, they can shift to a pale yellow (#FAFAD2), a light tan (#DEB887), or even a rust-tinged
            orange (#A0522D) if iron is present in the water source. Biofilm residues can add a greenish or brownish tint.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots around water droplets, streaks down vertical surfaces,
            and buildup along edges and crevices. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform coating. Areas with poor
            drainage or frequent wetting are prone to heavier deposits.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners where water accumulates and evaporates.
            Top surfaces of horizontal areas may have lighter deposits due to dust accumulation preventing direct water contact.
            Crevices and seams act as traps for mineral scale, leading to higher concentrations. Vertical walls have a gradient
            from top to bottom, with heavier deposits at the bottom due to water runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and a very thin film, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Patchy
            coverage with a thin, powdery layer, typically <50 μm thick. Moderate (30-60%): More continuous coverage with
            a thicker, slightly crusty layer, 50-200 μm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Almost complete coverage with a thick, hard
            crust, 200 μm - 1 mm thick. Extreme (>85%): Complete coverage with a very thick, heavily encrusted layer, >1 mm
            thick.'
          description: Mineral scale on aluminum typically presents as a chalky, off-white to tan-colored deposit. The texture
            ranges from a fine powder to a hard, crusty layer, depending on the water hardness and exposure time. Coverage
            can vary from sparse spotting to a complete coating, often concentrated in areas where water evaporates.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Uniform coating on flat horizontal surfaces. 2)
            Edge accumulation along seams and joints. 3) Point source spreading from dripping faucets or leaks. 4) Streaky/linear
            patterns on vertical surfaces due to water runoff. 5) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with intermittent water
            exposure. Edge accumulation and streaky patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Mineral scale preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and increased evaporation
            rates. The perimeter of a water droplet or puddle is a prime location for mineral deposition. The center of a
            large flat surface may have a more uniform, but potentially thinner, coating. Avoidance of edges is rare.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Mineral scale accumulates in corners due
            to capillary action and reduced airflow. Crevices act as traps, promoting buildup. Flat areas allow for pooling
            and uniform deposition. Vertical surfaces encourage dripping and streaking. Edges provide nucleation sites for
            mineral growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity strongly influences the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip
            marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Settling of mineral particles
            contributes to heavier deposits on lower surfaces. Runs down slopes are common, creating visible trails.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits tend to appear matte and chalky, scattering light. Aged
            deposits can exhibit a slight sheen if they have a crystalline structure or a smooth, compacted surface. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting tends to emphasize the off-white or yellowish tones.
          texture_details: The texture varies greatly. Fresh deposits can be powdery and easily wiped away. Over time, they
            harden into a crusty, sometimes crystalline structure. Depending on the presence of silica, the deposit can feel
            slightly gritty. Biofilm incorporation can make the surface feel slightly slimy or sticky.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-20 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach 5 mm or more.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Thin films on smooth surfaces. 2) Thick crusts in areas of heavy
            buildup. 3) Discrete patches where water droplets evaporate. 4) Spots/dots from individual water splashes. 5)
            Drip marks and runs/streaks on vertical surfaces. 6) Buildups in corners and crevices. The formation mechanism
            is primarily evaporation of water leaving behind dissolved minerals.'
          uniformity_assessment: The uniformity is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity is
            affected by water flow patterns, surface orientation, and the frequency of wetting and drying cycles. Areas with
            consistent water exposure tend to have more uniform deposits, while areas with intermittent exposure have patchy
            deposits.
        aluminum nitride:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a thin, powdery, light-colored film. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes thicker, harder, darker in color (tan to brown), and more tightly adhered to the surface.
            Cracking and flaking may occur in thick, aged deposits.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure to hard water. It begins at contact
            points and edges, then spreads inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is possible on flat surfaces with consistent
            wetting. Point sources expand outward, creating radial patterns. Layering effects can occur with fluctuating water
            conditions. Seasonal variations in water hardness can influence the rate of buildup over months.
          color_variations: Fresh deposits are often near-white (#F8F8FF) or a very light grey (#D3D3D3). As they age and
            incorporate iron oxides, they shift to a pale tan (#F5E7D0), then to a light brown (#A68B64), and eventually may
            exhibit rust-orange tinges (#B7410E) where iron is present. Biofilm residues can impart greenish or brownish hues.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks running down vertical surfaces, and accumulation
            along edges and in crevices. On horizontal surfaces, it can form a more uniform coating, often with concentric
            rings indicating evaporation patterns. Drip marks are frequently observed.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to evaporation. Top surfaces
            exposed to dripping water may have heavier deposits than sheltered areas. Crevices and areas with stagnant water
            also accumulate higher concentrations. Vertical walls exhibit a gradient, with heavier deposits at the bottom
            due to gravity.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Patchy
            distribution, thin film, easily removable. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, thicker deposits, requires
            more effort to remove. Heavy (60-85%): Near-complete coverage, thick crust, difficult to remove. Extreme (>85%):
            Complete encrustation, very thick and hard, may require aggressive cleaning methods. Thickness increases proportionally
            with coverage level.'
          description: Mineral scale on Aluminum Nitride typically presents as a patchy, off-white to tan coating. The texture
            ranges from powdery to crusty, depending on the water hardness and exposure time. Coverage varies significantly,
            from sparse spotting to near-complete encrustation, often concentrated at edges and crevices.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (due to evaporation effects), point
            source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance from the
            water source), patchy/spotty (uneven deposition), streaky/linear (due to water flow), and localized concentrations
            (in areas with stagnant water). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty distributions are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Mineral scale preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased evaporation rates and surface
            tension effects. The perimeter of a wetted area often shows a higher concentration of deposits compared to the
            center. This is a common and easily observable phenomenon.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Mineral scale accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to reduced water flow and increased evaporation. Flat areas may exhibit pooling and uniform coating.
            Vertical surfaces show drip marks. Edges act as nucleation sites, promoting buildup.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits.
            Runs down slopes are observed, with thicker deposits at the bottom of the slope.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits may appear matte or slightly chalky. Aged deposits can exhibit
            a slight sheen, especially if compacted. The presence of iron oxides can create subtle iridescence in some areas.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting tends to wash out the color, making the deposits appear whiter.
          texture_details: The texture varies from a fine, powdery feel when freshly deposited to a hard, crusty, and sometimes
            crystalline texture with age. It can be smooth in thin films but becomes increasingly rough and uneven with buildup.
            Microscopic examination reveals a heterogeneous mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (1-5 μm) for a fresh, thin film to several millimeters
            (0.1-2 mm) or more for heavy, aged buildup. The thickness is highly variable depending on water flow and exposure
            time.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks), runs/streaks (irregular flow patterns),
            thin films (early stage), thick crusts (advanced stage), discrete patches (isolated deposits), spots/dots (small,
            localized deposits), stains (discoloration of the AlN surface), and buildups (thick accumulations at edges or
            in crevices). Crystalline structures may be visible under magnification in some cases.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. Non-uniformity is caused by variations in surface temperature, water flow patterns, and the presence
            of nucleation sites (e.g., surface defects).
        concrete:
          aged_appearance: Fresh deposits (hours/days old) are typically thin, powdery, and white. Aged deposits (months/years
            old) become thicker, harder, and often exhibit color changes due to the incorporation of environmental contaminants.
            The surface may become more textured and uneven over time, with visible layering and cracking.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact points (e.g., edges, cracks) and then spreads
            outward. It can also begin as uniform gradual accumulation across the surface. Point sources (e.g., leaky pipes)
            expand outward over time. Layering effects are common, with new deposits forming on top of older ones. Seasonal
            variations in water usage and temperature can influence the rate of buildup. Initial film formation can occur
            within hours, while significant buildup may take days to months.
          color_variations: Fresh deposits are often a chalky white (#F8F8FF) or very light gray (#D3D3D3). As they age and
            incorporate minerals like iron oxides, they can turn to a light tan (#F5DEB3), yellowish-brown (#C19A6B), or even
            a rust-orange (#A0522D) in areas with high iron content. Biofilm presence can introduce greenish or brownish hues.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in depressions, and efflorescence
            (powdery deposits) on porous areas. Accumulation is often observed along edges, cracks, and joints where water
            tends to collect and evaporate. Splashing and runoff create radial or streaky patterns.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices where water accumulates.
            Top surfaces of horizontal areas exposed to splashing or dripping will have higher concentrations than sheltered
            areas. Vertical walls will show a gradient, with higher concentrations at the bottom due to gravity-driven runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or patches, barely visible. Thickness: <10 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Thin, powdery coating, easily removed. Thickness: 10-50 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable crust or film, requires
            some effort to remove. Thickness: 50-200 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, hard crust, difficult to remove. Thickness:
            200 μm - 1 mm. Extreme (>85%): Extensive encrustation, significantly alters surface appearance. Thickness: >1
            mm.'
          description: Mineral scale/hard water deposits on concrete typically appear as a whitish to off-white, sometimes
            yellowish or brownish, crusty or powdery layer. The coverage varies from sparse spotting to extensive encrustation,
            often concentrated in areas with frequent water exposure or evaporation. The texture ranges from smooth to rough
            depending on the scale's composition and age.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation along joints and cracks. 2)
            Point source spreading from leaky pipes or faucets. 3) Streaky/linear patterns from water runoff. 4) Patchy/spotty
            distribution on porous surfaces. 5) Gradient from source, with higher concentration near the water source and
            decreasing concentration further away.'
          edge_center_behavior: Mineral scale preferentially accumulates at edges and along joints due to capillary action
            and increased evaporation rates in these areas. The center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, or
            be relatively free of deposits if water runoff is efficient.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Mineral scale accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to water pooling. It builds up in depressions and follows contours. Drips form on vertical surfaces.
            Edges and joints act as nucleation sites for scale formation.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior creates drip marks and vertical streaking.
            Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Scale can hang from overhead
            surfaces in the form of stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits often appear bright white and reflective, while older deposits
            may have a more matte finish. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the yellowish or brownish tones. A slight
            sheen may be present on crystalline deposits, but generally, the surface is non-glossy.
          texture_details: The texture can range from a fine, powdery coating (similar to chalk dust) to a hard, crystalline
            crust. Fresh deposits often feel smooth or slightly gritty. Older, thicker deposits are typically rough, uneven,
            and may exhibit a layered or nodular structure. Biofilm incorporation can make the surface feel slimy or sticky.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of a few micrometers (5-20 μm) to heavy buildup of several millimeters
            (1-5 mm) or more in areas with prolonged exposure. Extreme cases can reach thicknesses of 10 mm or greater.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks on vertical surfaces. 2) Runs/streaks from water
            flow. 3) Thin films on smooth surfaces. 4) Thick crusts in areas with heavy buildup. 5) Discrete patches on porous
            areas. 6) Stains that penetrate the concrete surface. 7) Crystalline structures in areas with slow evaporation.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare, as the deposition process is influenced by variations in surface porosity, water flow, and evaporation
            rates. Areas with higher water exposure and evaporation tend to have higher concentrations.
        stainless steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days old) typically appears as a thin, easily removable film with a
            light color. Aged contamination (months/years old) becomes thicker, harder, and more deeply colored due to the
            incorporation of minerals and organic matter. The texture also becomes more pronounced, with visible layering
            and crystal growth.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film within hours of exposure to hard water. It then thickens
            over days and weeks, especially at contact points with water. Scale often begins at edges and spreads inward.
            Uniform gradual accumulation is possible in submerged areas. Point sources, such as dripping faucets, expand outward
            over time. Layering effects are common, with new layers of scale depositing on top of older layers. Seasonal variations
            in water hardness can also influence the rate and composition of scale buildup. Timeframes range from hours for
            initial film formation to months or years for significant buildup.
          color_variations: Fresh deposits are often a pale off-white (#F8F8FF) or light gray (#D3D3D3). As they age and incorporate
            iron oxides, they can shift to a light tan (#F4A460), a yellowish-brown (#DEB887), or even a rust-tinged orange
            (#A0522D) if iron is present in the water source. Biofilm residues can impart a greenish-gray hue (#8FBC8F).
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots around faucets and fixtures, streaks down vertical surfaces
            from dripping water, and a uniform coating on surfaces that are frequently submerged or exposed to spray. Accumulation
            is often heavier in crevices, corners, and areas with poor drainage.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners due to capillary action and evaporation.
            Top surfaces exposed to dripping water may have heavier deposits than bottom surfaces. Crevices and welds provide
            nucleation sites for scale formation. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a more uniform layer than vertical surfaces,
            where gravity causes runoff.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Scattered
            patches and thin films, easily removable. Moderate (30-60%): More extensive coverage with visible buildup, requires
            more effort to remove. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating with significant buildup, difficult to remove.
            Extreme (>85%): Very thick, rock-like crust covering almost the entire surface, extremely difficult to remove.
            Thickness correlates with coverage, ranging from micrometers in sparse areas to millimeters in extreme cases.'
          description: Mineral scale on stainless steel typically presents as a chalky, off-white to tan-colored deposit.
            The texture ranges from a fine powder to a hard, crusty layer, depending on the water hardness and exposure time.
            Coverage can vary from sparse spotting to a thick, continuous coating, often concentrated in areas with stagnant
            water or repeated wetting/drying cycles.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in submerged areas), edge accumulation
            (around seams and welds), point source spreading (from dripping faucets), gradient from source (decreasing thickness
            with distance from water source), patchy/spotty (in areas with intermittent exposure), streaky/linear (from water
            runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Mineral scale often preferentially accumulates at edges due to capillary action and increased
            evaporation rates. The perimeter of a wetted area will often show a higher concentration of scale than the center.
            This is especially true in areas with intermittent wetting and drying cycles. Uniform distribution is possible
            in submerged areas, but edge accumulation is more common in most industrial settings.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Scale accumulates in corners due to capillary
            action. It builds up in crevices, providing sheltered areas for nucleation. It pools on flat areas due to gravity.
            It drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. It collects at edges due to evaporation. It follows contours,
            conforming to the shape of the surface. It can bridge gaps, forming continuous layers across small openings. It
            fills depressions, creating uneven surfaces.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in distribution. Downward flow behavior is evident in drip marks
            and streaks. Pooling occurs at bottom edges and on horizontal surfaces. Vertical streaking is common on walls.
            Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces, leading to thicker deposits. Runs occur down slopes, creating uneven coatings.
            Scale can hang from overhead surfaces in the form of stalactite-like formations in extreme cases.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits may appear matte and reflective. Older, thicker deposits
            can have a slightly chalky or dull appearance. Wet deposits may exhibit a slight sheen. Iridescence is rare but
            possible if the scale is very thin and composed of layered minerals.
          texture_details: The texture can range from a fine, powdery coating that feels slightly gritty to the touch, to
            a hard, crystalline crust. In areas with high silica content, the scale can have a glassy or slightly smooth feel.
            Biofilm incorporation can make the surface feel slimy or sticky, especially when wet. Close inspection may reveal
            a layered structure or individual crystal formations.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film of 1-10 μm for fresh deposits to a heavy buildup of 0.1-2 mm
            or more for aged contamination. In extreme cases, scale can reach several millimeters in thickness, resembling
            a hard, rock-like crust.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks from dripping water), runs/streaks
            (from water runoff), thin films (early stage deposits), thick crusts (aged deposits), discrete patches (localized
            areas of contamination), spots/dots (small, isolated deposits), stains (discoloration of the stainless steel surface),
            uniform coatings (in submerged areas), buildups (thick accumulations in specific areas), crystalline structures
            (visible crystal growth in some cases).'
          uniformity_assessment: Uniformity varies greatly depending on the exposure conditions. Perfectly uniform distribution
            is rare. Mostly uniform distribution with minor variations is possible in submerged areas. Moderately patchy distribution
            is common in areas with intermittent exposure. Highly variable/irregular distribution is typical in areas with
            dripping or splashing water. Concentration is often higher in areas with stagnant water or poor drainage.
        steel:
          aged_appearance: Fresh deposits (hours/days) are typically thin, powdery, and off-white. Aged deposits (months/years)
            become thicker, harder, and darker, often incorporating rust and biofilm. The color shifts from white/gray to
            tan/brown/red. The texture becomes more crusty and less powdery. Thickness increases significantly.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film within hours of exposure to hard water. It begins at contact
            points (e.g., scratches, imperfections) and spreads outward. Scale often starts at edges and moves inward. Accumulation
            is gradual and can be influenced by seasonal variations in water hardness and temperature. Layering effects can
            occur due to changes in water chemistry over time. Point sources (e.g., leaks) expand outward over days and weeks.
            Significant buildup (visible crust) can occur within months.
          color_variations:
          - 'Fresh: Off-white (#F8F8FF) to light gray (#D3D3D3)'
          - 'Slightly Stained: Pale yellow (#FFFFE0) with localized rust-orange (#B7410E) spots'
          - 'Moderately Aged: Tan (#D2B48C) with reddish-brown (#A0522D) streaks from iron oxide'
          - 'Heavily Aged: Dark brown (#8B4513) with possible green or black biofilm patches'
          - 'Silica Rich: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with a slightly translucent appearance'
          common_patterns: Common patterns include drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas, and buildup
            around edges and crevices. Scale often forms a ring or tide mark at the waterline. Localized spots occur where
            water droplets evaporate. Uniform coatings are rare, except in continuously submerged conditions.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices where water accumulates. Top
            surfaces of horizontal areas may have heavier deposits due to evaporation. Bottom areas of vertical surfaces show
            drip marks and pooling. Exposed areas with high water flow may have less buildup than sheltered areas with stagnant
            water.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and stains, barely visible. Thickness: <5 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Patchy coverage, thin film. Thickness: 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant coverage, visible buildup. Thickness:
            25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive coverage, thick crust. Thickness: 100 μm - 1 mm. Extreme (>85%): Nearly complete
            coverage, very thick buildup. Thickness: >1 mm.'
          description: Mineral scale and hard water deposits on steel typically appear as a dull, off-white to tan coating,
            often with localized rust staining. The texture ranges from powdery to crusty, and the distribution is highly
            variable, depending on water flow and surface geometry.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1) Edge accumulation: Scale builds up along edges
            and welds. 2) Point source spreading: Deposits radiate outward from a leak or drip. 3) Streaky/linear: Drip marks
            and runs down vertical surfaces. 4) Patchy/spotty: Irregular distribution due to uneven water contact. 5) Localized
            concentrations: Heavy buildup in areas with stagnant water.'
          edge_center_behavior: Scale preferentially accumulates at edges and welds due to increased surface area and stagnant
            water. The center areas may have less buildup due to higher water flow or easier removal. However, if the entire
            surface is submerged, the center may also accumulate scale.
          geometry_effects: Scale accumulates in corners and crevices due to stagnant water. It builds up in crevices and
            welds. It pools on flat areas. It drips on vertical surfaces. It collects at edges. It follows contours. It can
            bridge gaps between surfaces. It fills depressions.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Scale settles on horizontal surfaces. Water runs down slopes. Scale
            can hang from overhead surfaces as stalactite-like formations (rare on steel, more common in caves).
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits appear matte and slightly reflective. Aged deposits can
            have a dull, earthy appearance. Biofilm can create a slight sheen. Iron oxide can exhibit a reddish-brown reflection.
            Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the colors appear muted and less vibrant.
          texture_details: The texture varies from smooth and powdery (fresh deposits) to rough and crusty (aged deposits).
            Calcium carbonate forms fine, granular structures. Calcium sulfate can form larger, more crystalline structures.
            Biofilm residues contribute a sticky or slimy feel. Silica deposits can be glassy or chalky. Iron oxide creates
            a rough, pitted surface.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 μm) to heavy buildup (100 μm - 2 mm), depending on water
            hardness, flow rate, and exposure time. In extreme cases, buildup can exceed 5 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Drip marks: Vertical streaks caused by water running down the
            surface. 2) Runs/streaks: Similar to drip marks but less defined. 3) Pools/puddles: Accumulation of scale in low-lying
            areas. 4) Thin films: Uniform or patchy coatings. 5) Thick crusts: Hard, layered deposits. 6) Discrete patches:
            Isolated areas of scale. 7) Spots/dots: Small, localized deposits. 8) Stains: Discoloration of the steel surface.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            coatings are rare. Variations are caused by differences in water flow, temperature, surface orientation, and the
            presence of nucleation sites (e.g., scratches, imperfections).
        titanium:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) is typically a thin, powdery white film. Aged contamination (months/years)
            becomes thicker, harder, and darker, often exhibiting a tan to rust-orange color. The texture evolves from powdery
            to crusty, and the scale can become more difficult to remove. Thickness increases significantly over time.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film (hours), then thickens gradually (days). It often begins at contact
            points (e.g., welds, scratches) and spreads outward. Accumulation can be uniform or localized depending on water
            flow. Layering effects can occur due to changes in water chemistry or temperature. Seasonal variations in water
            hardness can influence the rate of buildup over months.
          color_variations: Fresh deposits are often a chalky white (#F5F5F5) or very light grey (#D3D3D3). As iron oxide
            incorporates, colors shift to pale yellow (#FAFAD2), then tan (#D2B48C), and eventually a rust-orange (#A0522D)
            if significant iron is present. Biofilm can introduce greenish or brownish hues.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include localized spots, streaks from dripping water, and uniform coatings in areas
            with consistent water exposure. Scale tends to accumulate at edges, in crevices, and around welds due to increased
            surface roughness and potential for localized corrosion. 'Tide mark' rings are also common where water levels
            fluctuate.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and in crevices due to surface tension and
            reduced water flow. Top surfaces exposed to dripping water often have heavier deposits than vertical walls. Corners
            and areas with stagnant water also exhibit higher concentrations. Flat horizontal surfaces can accumulate thicker
            layers due to settling of particulate matter.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots and thin streaks, barely visible. Thickness < 5 μm. Light
            (10-30%): Patchy distribution with a thin, powdery film. Thickness 5-25 μm. Moderate (30-60%): More widespread
            coverage with a noticeable tan or white coating. Thickness 25-100 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, crusty deposits covering
            most of the surface. Thickness 100-500 μm. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, dense buildup that obscures the underlying
            titanium. Thickness > 500 μm.'
          description: Mineral scale on titanium typically presents as a mottled, off-white to tan coating. The texture ranges
            from powdery to crusty depending on the water hardness and temperature. Coverage can be localized or widespread,
            often accumulating in areas with stagnant water or high evaporation rates.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: uniform coating (in areas with constant immersion),
            edge accumulation (due to surface tension and evaporation), point source spreading (from leaks or drips), gradient
            from source (decreasing thickness with distance from the source), patchy/spotty (due to inconsistent water exposure),
            and streaky/linear (from water flow). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Mineral scale preferentially accumulates at edges due to surface tension effects and increased
            evaporation rates. The perimeter of a wetted area often exhibits a higher concentration of scale compared to the
            center. This is due to the outward migration of dissolved minerals as the water evaporates from the edge.
          geometry_effects: Scale accumulates in corners and crevices due to reduced water flow and increased surface area.
            It pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces. Drips form on vertical surfaces. Scale collects at edges
            due to surface tension effects. The scale tends to follow contours and fill depressions, creating a more uniform
            surface over time.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Settling of particulate matter
            on horizontal surfaces contributes to thicker deposits. Runs down slopes are also observed. The angle of the surface
            significantly impacts the rate and pattern of scale formation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh deposits often appear matte and chalky. Aged deposits can exhibit
            a slight sheen, especially if they contain crystalline structures. The color can appear more vibrant under direct
            sunlight compared to indoor fluorescent lighting. No significant iridescence is typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture can vary significantly. Fresh deposits are often powdery and easily wiped away. Over
            time, they can become crystalline and hard, forming a crusty or scaly surface. The scale can feel rough to the
            touch, especially with thicker deposits. Microscopic examination may reveal a layered structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (5-20 μm) for a fresh, light film to several millimeters
            (0.5-3 mm) for heavy, aged buildup. In extreme cases, buildup can reach up to 5 mm or more, but this is less common
            on titanium compared to other metals.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (from water running down vertical surfaces), runs/streaks
            (similar to drip marks but more diffuse), thin films (early stages of contamination), thick crusts (advanced stages),
            discrete patches (localized areas of buildup), spots/dots (small, isolated deposits), stains (discoloration of
            the titanium surface), and buildups (accumulation of scale in specific areas). Crystalline structures can form
            under specific conditions of temperature and supersaturation.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare unless the titanium is consistently submerged in a controlled environment. Non-uniformity
            is caused by variations in water flow, temperature, surface roughness, and the presence of nucleation sites.

      appearance_on_materials:
        abs:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as a subtle color change and a slight loss of gloss. Aged contamination
            (months/years) shows a significant color shift, a thick chalky layer, and visible cracking. The surface becomes
            increasingly brittle and prone to flaking.
          buildup_progression: The buildup progression starts as a thin film within hours/days of UV exposure. It begins at
            contact points (e.g., edges, corners) and gradually spreads inward. The film thickens over weeks/months, leading
            to cracking and flaking. Seasonal variations (e.g., increased UV in summer) accelerate the degradation process.
          color_variations: 1. Original ABS color (e.g., dark gray, black, white). 2. Faded/bleached version of original color.
            3. Light gray with a yellowish tinge. 4. Chalky white with slight brown staining (from binder oxidation). 5. Off-white
            with a powdery, dull appearance.
          common_patterns: The degradation often starts as a hazy film that gradually thickens and becomes more pronounced.
            It tends to accumulate on horizontal surfaces, edges, and areas with higher UV exposure. Streaking may occur on
            vertical surfaces due to rain or condensation washing away loose particles.
          concentration_variations: 'Concentration tends to be higher on: 1. Horizontal surfaces (dust and particle accumulation).
            2. Edges and corners (higher UV exposure). 3. Exposed areas (direct sunlight). 4. Top surfaces (direct UV exposure).
            Concentration is lower in sheltered areas and on vertical surfaces where rain washes away the chalky layer.'
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Slight color change, minimal chalkiness. 2. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            color fading, thin powdery film. 3. Moderate (30-60%): Significant chalkiness, visible cracking, thickness ~0.1-0.5mm.
            4. Heavy (60-85%): Thick chalky layer, extensive cracking, thickness ~0.5-1mm. 5. Extreme (>85%): Very thick crust,
            severe cracking and flaking, thickness >1mm.'
          description: UV photodegradation on ABS results in a chalky, matte finish with a color shift towards lighter, often
            yellowish or grayish hues. The surface becomes rough and powdery, and the degradation tends to be uneven, concentrating
            in areas exposed to direct sunlight and moisture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating (light degradation). 2. Edge accumulation
            (perimeter degradation). 3. Point source spreading (localized degradation around imperfections). 4. Gradient from
            source (decreasing degradation with distance from UV source). 5. Patchy/spotty (uneven degradation due to varying
            UV exposure).'
          edge_center_behavior: UV Photodegradation / Polymer Chalking preferentially accumulates at edges due to higher UV
            exposure and increased moisture retention. The center areas may show less degradation, especially if they are
            slightly recessed or sheltered.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. The chalky layer accumulates in corners and
            crevices due to reduced airflow and increased moisture retention. Flat areas experience more uniform degradation.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior results in pooling at
            bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces,
            leading to thicker accumulation.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears intensely bright and matte, lacking any gloss
            or reflection. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the unevenness of the degradation and highlights the powdery
            texture. No iridescence or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: The texture transforms from smooth and glossy to rough and powdery. It feels dry and chalky to
            the touch, easily transferring to fingers. Microscopic examination reveals a network of fine cracks and a loss
            of surface gloss. A slight graininess may be visible due to the degraded polymer fragments and filler particles.
          thickness_range: The chalky layer can range from a few micrometers (initial stages) to several millimeters (severe
            degradation). It starts as a paper-thin film and can build up to a coin-thick crust in extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (early stages). 2. Thick crusts (advanced stages).
            3. Discrete patches (localized degradation). 4. Spots/dots (initial degradation points). 5. Stains (discoloration
            from oxidized binder residues). 6. Buildups (accumulation on horizontal surfaces).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low because UV exposure, moisture levels, and surface imperfections vary across the ABS component. Some areas
            are sheltered from UV, leading to less degradation.
        acrylic (pmma):
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days/weeks) appears as a subtle haze or slight dulling of the surface. Aged
            contamination (months/years) becomes a thick, easily removable powdery layer. The color shifts from white to yellow/brown,
            and the acrylic becomes more brittle and prone to cracking. The chalking layer can become quite thick (hundreds
            of micrometers).
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin, transparent film (hours/days). 2.
            The film gradually thickens and becomes hazy (days/weeks). 3. A powdery white layer forms (weeks/months). 4. The
            layer thickens and becomes more yellow/brown (months/years). 5. Cracking and embrittlement occur (years). The
            process can be accelerated by high UV exposure, humidity, and temperature. Seasonal variations in UV intensity
            can lead to layering effects, with alternating layers of different colors and thicknesses.'
          color_variations: 1. **Pristine PMMA:** Clear, transparent. 2. **Early Stage:** Slightly hazy, off-white, almost
            imperceptible. 3. **Moderate Chalking:** Dull white with a hint of yellow or beige. 4. **Advanced Chalking:**
            Chalky white with a noticeable yellow or brownish tint, sometimes with darker grey areas where dirt has accumulated.
            5. **Severe Degradation:** Yellowed, cracked, and brittle with a distinct brownish-grey cast, especially in areas
            with heavy dirt accumulation.
          common_patterns: The chalking often starts as a uniform haze across the exposed surface. In areas with uneven UV
            exposure or moisture accumulation, it can form localized spots or streaks. Edges and corners tend to accumulate
            more chalking due to increased surface area and potential for moisture condensation. Vertical surfaces may exhibit
            drip marks from water runoff carrying chalking debris.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on exposed surfaces, edges, and corners. Top surfaces
            exposed to direct sunlight and rain often exhibit higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Vertical walls may
            have lighter concentrations at the top and heavier concentrations at the bottom due to gravity-driven runoff.
            Crevices and areas where moisture accumulates also tend to have higher concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: '1. **Sparse (<10%):** Slight haze, barely noticeable. Thickness: <1 micrometer. 2. **Light (10-30%):**
            Dull surface, slight powdery feel. Thickness: 1-10 micrometers. 3. **Moderate (30-60%):** Noticeable white coating,
            easily rubs off. Thickness: 10-50 micrometers. 4. **Heavy (60-85%):** Thick, chalky layer, significant color change.
            Thickness: 50-100 micrometers. 5. **Extreme (>85%):** Very thick, cracked, and brittle layer. Thickness: >100
            micrometers.'
          description: UV photodegradation/polymer chalking on acrylic (PMMA) manifests as a hazy, whitish or yellowish surface
            discoloration. The surface loses its original clarity and develops a fine, powdery texture. Coverage can range
            from localized patches to a uniform coating, depending on exposure and environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating (initial stage). 2. Edge accumulation
            (due to higher UV exposure and moisture). 3. Patchy/spotty (due to uneven UV exposure or localized contamination).
            4. Streaky/linear (due to water runoff). 5. Gradient from source (e.g., higher concentration near a UV source).
            6. Localized concentrations in areas prone to moisture accumulation.'
          edge_center_behavior: UV photodegradation/polymer chalking preferentially accumulates at edges on Acrylic (PMMA).
            This is due to the increased surface area at edges, which leads to higher UV exposure and greater potential for
            moisture condensation. The edges also act as collection points for airborne contaminants. The center areas typically
            exhibit a more uniform, but less concentrated, chalking layer.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Chalking accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to increased surface area and potential for moisture trapping. Flat areas tend to have a more uniform coating.
            Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges and corners are more susceptible to UV exposure and therefore exhibit
            higher chalking concentrations.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role on vertical surfaces, leading to downward flow of water and
            chalking debris. This results in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking
            is a common phenomenon. Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate a thicker layer of chalking due to settling of
            airborne particles and reduced runoff.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears intensely white and reflects light diffusely,
            losing its original gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the yellowish or brownish tint more clearly. The
            chalked surface has a matte finish and does not exhibit any sheen or iridescence. The degraded surface scatters
            light, reducing transparency.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface feels smooth but slightly less glossy. As chalking progresses, it becomes
            increasingly rough and powdery to the touch. The powder is very fine and easily rubs off. At a microscopic level,
            the surface exhibits a network of micro-cracks and a loss of the original smooth polymer structure.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a few micrometers (early stage) to several hundred micrometers (advanced
            stage). Early chalking is paper-thin; advanced chalking can be comparable to the thickness of a few sheets of
            paper.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (early stage). 2. Powdery coatings (moderate to advanced
            stage). 3. Drip marks (on vertical surfaces). 4. Runs/streaks (due to water runoff). 5. Discrete patches (localized
            degradation). 6. Stains (due to dirt and pollutants adhering to the chalked surface). 7. Buildups (at edges and
            corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The uniformity of the distribution varies. Initially, it's mostly uniform with minor variations.
            As chalking progresses, it becomes moderately patchy due to variations in UV exposure, moisture, and surface imperfections.
            Highly variable/irregular distribution is common in areas with complex geometries or uneven environmental conditions.
        nylon:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as a light dusting, easily removable. Aged contamination (months/years)
            becomes a thicker, more adherent layer. Color shifts from off-white to yellowish-gray or dull gray. The texture
            becomes more crusty and less easily removed, with potential for cracking or flaking of the chalked layer.
          buildup_progression: Buildup starts as a thin film, often at edges or contact points. It then spreads inward and
            thickens over time. Uniform gradual accumulation occurs on exposed surfaces. Point sources expand outward. Layering
            effects can be observed due to seasonal variations in UV exposure and moisture levels. The process can take weeks
            to months to become visually significant.
          color_variations: 1. **Original Nylon Color (Faded):** Slightly desaturated version of the original nylon color.
            2. **Off-White/Creamy White:** The initial chalking appears as a light, powdery coating. 3. **Yellowish-Gray:**
            As the polymer degrades and contaminants oxidize, a yellow or gray tint develops. 4. **Dull Gray/Light Gray:**
            Represents advanced degradation and accumulation of inorganic contaminants. 5. **Brownish-Yellow (Localized):**
            Possible staining from oxidized binder residues or specific contaminants.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform fading, localized chalking in high-exposure areas, and accumulation
            in crevices or along edges where moisture and contaminants collect. Streaking can occur on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation washing away the chalking. Flat surfaces tend to accumulate a thicker, more uniform layer.
          concentration_variations: 'Concentration tends to be heavier on: 1. **Exposed Areas:** Surfaces facing direct sunlight.
            2. **Horizontal Surfaces:** Where dust and debris settle. 3. **Edges and Corners:** Due to capillary action and
            contaminant accumulation. 4. **Crevices:** Where moisture and contaminants collect. Lighter concentrations are
            typically found on sheltered areas and vertical surfaces that are frequently washed by rain.'
          coverage_ranges: 1. **Sparse (<10%):** Light dusting, barely visible, minimal thickness. 2. **Light (10-30%):**
            Noticeable fading, powdery texture, thin film. 3. **Moderate (30-60%):** Obvious chalking, significant color change,
            moderate thickness. 4. **Heavy (60-85%):** Thick, obscuring layer, significant texture change, substantial buildup.
            5. **Extreme (>85%):** Complete coverage, thick crust, potential for cracking and flaking.
          description: UV photodegradation/polymer chalking on nylon presents as a dull, faded surface with a powdery or chalky
            texture. The dominant colors are typically off-white, yellowish, or grayish, depending on the original nylon color
            and the specific contaminants. Coverage can range from sparse dusting to a thick, obscuring layer, often concentrated
            in areas exposed to direct sunlight or moisture.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1. **Uniform Coating:** On flat, exposed surfaces.
            2. **Edge Accumulation:** Along edges and corners where contaminants deposit. 3. **Point Source Spreading:** Around
            areas of initial degradation or contamination. 4. **Gradient from Source:** Decreasing concentration away from
            a UV source or moisture source. 5. **Patchy/Spotty:** Due to uneven exposure or material variations.'
          edge_center_behavior: UV photodegradation/polymer chalking preferentially accumulates at edges and corners due to
            capillary action, moisture retention, and contaminant deposition. The center areas of large, flat surfaces may
            exhibit a more uniform, but generally lighter, coating compared to the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Chalking accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture and contaminant trapping. Flat areas tend to pool contaminants, leading to thicker deposits. Edges
            act as collection points. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaking.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role, causing downward flow of water and contaminants. This results
            in pooling at bottom edges, drip marks from top to bottom, and vertical streaking. Horizontal surfaces accumulate
            settled dust and debris, leading to thicker, more uniform chalking.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears matte and dull, with no gloss or sheen. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting reveals the color variations and texture more subtly. There is no iridescence or rainbow
            effect. The surface scatters light diffusely, reducing reflectivity.
          texture_details: The texture is generally powdery, chalky, and dry to the touch. It's often rough and easily rubs
            off. At a microscopic level, the surface may exhibit a fine, granular structure due to the degraded polymer fragments
            and inorganic particles. The original smooth surface of the nylon is lost, replaced by a matte, slightly abrasive
            feel.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 micrometers) in early stages to a heavy buildup (100-500
            micrometers or more) in advanced stages. A heavy buildup can be comparable to the thickness of a few sheets of
            paper.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. **Thin Films:** Early stages of chalking. 2. **Thick Crusts:**
            Advanced stages of buildup. 3. **Discrete Patches:** Localized areas of degradation. 4. **Spots/Dots:** Initial
            points of contamination. 5. **Stains:** Discoloration from oxidized residues. 6. **Drip Marks/Runs/Streaks:**
            On vertical surfaces due to water runoff.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is generally moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. Uniformity depends on factors like UV exposure, airflow, moisture levels, and the presence
            of surface imperfections. Areas shielded from UV light will show less chalking.
        polycarbonate:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days/weeks) appears as a subtle haze or slight discoloration. Aged contamination
            (months/years) results in a thicker, more opaque, and often discolored layer. The texture becomes significantly
            rougher, and the chalked material may become more tightly bound to the surface, making it harder to remove. Cracking
            and crazing of the polycarbonate become more pronounced.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin, invisible film within hours of UV
            exposure. 2. Develops into a visible haze within days. 3. Thickens into a chalky white layer over weeks to months.
            4. Discoloration and cracking become apparent after several months to years. 5. The chalked layer may become more
            tightly bound over time, making it harder to remove. Seasonal variations in UV intensity and moisture levels can
            accelerate or decelerate the process.'
          color_variations: 1. **Original Clear Polycarbonate:** Transparent, colorless. 2. **Initial Haze:** Slightly translucent,
            milky white or faint yellow. 3. **Light Chalking:** Off-white, chalky white, or pale yellow-gray. 4. **Moderate
            Chalking:** Dull white, cream, or light tan, with possible yellowing. 5. **Severe Chalking:** Opaque white, yellowish-brown,
            or gray, potentially with darker staining from accumulated dirt.
          common_patterns: Common patterns include uniform chalking across exposed surfaces, localized spots where UV exposure
            is concentrated (e.g., areas with direct sunlight), and streaks or drip marks where moisture has carried away
            chalked material. Edges and corners often exhibit more pronounced chalking due to higher UV exposure and potential
            for moisture accumulation.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on edges and corners due to increased UV exposure and
            moisture accumulation. Top surfaces exposed to direct sunlight typically have higher concentrations than shaded
            areas. Crevices and areas where water can pool may also exhibit higher concentrations. Vertical walls may show
            a gradient with higher concentration at the top due to UV exposure and downward movement of chalked material.
          coverage_ranges: 1. **Sparse (<10% coverage):** Barely visible haze, slight loss of gloss, thickness < 1 micrometer.
            2. **Light (10-30%):** Noticeable milky appearance, slightly rough texture, thickness 1-10 micrometers. 3. **Moderate
            (30-60%):** Opaque white or yellowish film, powdery texture, thickness 10-50 micrometers. 4. **Heavy (60-85%):**
            Thick, easily removable chalky layer, significant discoloration, thickness 50-100 micrometers. 5. **Extreme (>85%):**
            Very thick, heavily discolored, and potentially cracked layer, significant loss of structural integrity, thickness
            >100 micrometers.
          description: UV photodegradation and chalking on polycarbonate manifests as a surface discoloration and roughening,
            primarily due to the breakdown of the polymer and the exposure of additives like TiO₂. The surface transitions
            from clear to a hazy, matte finish with a powdery texture, often appearing as a white or yellowish film. Coverage
            can be uniform or patchy, depending on UV exposure and environmental factors.
          distribution_patterns: 'Typical distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating on directly exposed surfaces.
            2. Edge accumulation due to higher UV exposure and moisture collection. 3. Point source spreading from areas of
            initial degradation. 4. Gradient from source of UV exposure (e.g., more chalking on the side facing the sun).
            5. Patchy/spotty distribution due to variations in UV intensity or surface imperfections. Uniform coating and
            edge accumulation are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: UV Photodegradation / Polymer Chalking preferentially accumulates at edges due to higher UV
            exposure and moisture accumulation. The edges receive more direct sunlight and are more susceptible to environmental
            weathering. While the center areas also degrade, the effect is often less pronounced than at the edges. The mechanism
            is primarily related to increased UV radiation intensity and moisture concentration at edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Chalking accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to increased UV exposure and moisture retention. Flat areas tend to develop a more uniform coating. Vertical
            surfaces exhibit drip marks and streaks as chalked material is washed away by rain or condensation. Edges collect
            chalked material due to their higher surface area and exposure.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of chalked material, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip
            marks from top to bottom on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of this effect. Settling
            of chalked particles on horizontal surfaces contributes to a thicker accumulation over time. The effect is visually
            significant, especially after rainfall.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, chalked polycarbonate exhibits a matte finish with high diffuse reflectance,
            appearing brighter and whiter. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the chalked surface as dull and less reflective
            compared to the original glossy surface. There is no significant iridescence or rainbow effect, but the matte
            surface scatters light, reducing glare.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface remains relatively smooth, but as degradation progresses, it becomes increasingly
            rough and powdery to the touch. The chalked layer consists of fine, loosely bound particles that easily rub off.
            At a microscopic level, the surface exhibits micro-cracking and a loss of gloss, transitioning from a smooth,
            reflective surface to a matte, diffuse one.
          thickness_range: Thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 micrometers) in early stages to a heavy buildup (100-500
            micrometers or more) in advanced stages. The chalked layer can be paper-thin initially, progressing to a coating
            that is easily visible and measurable with a thickness gauge.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films in early stages. 2. Thick crusts in advanced stages.
            3. Discrete patches where degradation is localized. 4. Spots/dots indicating initial degradation points. 5. Stains
            from accumulated dirt and moisture within the chalked layer. 6. Uniform coatings on exposed surfaces. Drip marks
            and runs/streaks are also common on vertical surfaces.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to mostly uniform with minor variations.
            Perfectly uniform distribution is rare due to variations in UV exposure, surface imperfections, and environmental
            factors. The uniformity level is primarily influenced by the consistency of UV exposure across the surface.
        polyethylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as a light, easily removable white powder. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes more tightly bound, discolored (yellowish or grayish), and thicker. Cracking and crazing
            of the polyethylene surface beneath the chalking layer become more apparent with age.
          buildup_progression: The buildup progression starts as a thin film (hours/days) uniformly distributed. It then thickens
            and becomes patchy (days/weeks). Edges and corners accumulate more rapidly (weeks/months). Over time (months/years),
            the chalking becomes a thick, crusty layer, often discolored and cracked. Layering effects can occur due to seasonal
            variations in UV exposure and precipitation.
          color_variations: 1. Pristine White (fresh chalking, high TiO₂ content), 2. Off-White/Cream (slightly aged, some
            polymer degradation), 3. Yellowish-White (moderate degradation, oxidized polymer fragments), 4. Grayish-White
            (heavy degradation, dirt accumulation), 5. Mottled Brown/Tan (localized areas of severe degradation and binder
            oxidation)
          common_patterns: The chalking often starts as a uniform dusting, but quickly becomes uneven. It accumulates preferentially
            on exposed surfaces, especially those facing the sun. Streaks and drip marks are common on vertical surfaces due
            to rain or condensation. Edges and corners often exhibit heavier buildup.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on exposed surfaces, edges, and corners. Vertical walls
            exhibit a concentration gradient from top to bottom due to water runoff. Crevices and low points accumulate more
            chalking due to gravity and water collection. Sheltered areas exhibit lighter concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting of white powder, barely visible. Light (10-30%): Noticeable
            white coating, underlying polyethylene still visible. Moderate (30-60%): Significant white coating, partially
            obscuring the polyethylene. Heavy (60-85%): Thick white coating, mostly obscuring the polyethylene. Extreme (>85%):
            Very thick, crusty white coating, completely obscuring the polyethylene. Thickness increases proportionally with
            coverage.'
          description: UV Photodegradation/Polymer Chalking on polyethylene manifests as a powdery, often white or off-white
            surface layer. The texture is typically rough and easily rubs off, revealing the underlying polymer. Coverage
            can range from sparse dusting to a thick, obscuring coating, often unevenly distributed.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: uniform coating (early stages), edge accumulation
            (due to weathering and surface tension), point source spreading (from localized degradation), gradient from source
            (decreasing concentration with distance from the most exposed area), patchy/spotty (uneven degradation), streaky/linear
            (due to water runoff), localized concentrations (in crevices and low points). Edge accumulation and patchy/spotty
            patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: UV Photodegradation/Polymer Chalking preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased
            exposure to weathering elements (UV radiation, moisture, temperature fluctuations). The edges are also more susceptible
            to mechanical stress, which can accelerate degradation. While the center areas also degrade, the effect is often
            less pronounced.
          geometry_effects: The surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Chalking accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to reduced airflow and increased moisture retention. Flat areas tend to have a more uniform coating, while
            vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges collect more chalking due to weathering and surface tension effects.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow behavior, resulting in pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravity's influence. Chalking settles on horizontal
            surfaces, leading to thicker accumulations compared to vertical surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears matte and highly reflective, often creating
            a glare. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the unevenness of the coating and any discoloration. There is no
            inherent sheen or iridescence; the surface is generally dull.
          texture_details: The texture is typically powdery and easily rubs off. It feels dry and chalky to the touch. At
            close range, a fine granular structure is visible, resembling a loosely packed powder. The surface is generally
            rough, lacking the original smooth finish of the polyethylene.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a thin film (1-10 micrometers) in early stages to a heavy buildup (100-500
            micrometers) in advanced stages. Extreme cases can reach up to 1 millimeter in localized areas.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: thin films (early stages), thick crusts (advanced stages), discrete
            patches (localized degradation), spots/dots (initial degradation points), stains (discoloration from oxidized
            binder residues), uniform coatings (early stages, rare), buildups (at edges and corners), drip marks (on vertical
            surfaces), runs/streaks (due to water runoff).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            distribution is rare. The unevenness is caused by variations in UV exposure, temperature, humidity, and surface
            imperfections on the polyethylene.
        polypropylene:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as a subtle haze or slight discoloration. Aged contamination
            (months/years) becomes a thick, easily rubbed-off chalky layer. The color shifts from off-white to yellow or brown,
            and the texture becomes more powdery and less adherent. Cracking and crazing of the underlying polymer become
            visible.
          buildup_progression: The buildup starts as a thin film within hours of UV exposure. Over days, this film thickens
            and becomes more visible. After months, a significant chalky layer forms, and the color starts to change. Seasonal
            variations, such as increased UV exposure in summer, can accelerate the degradation process. Layering effects
            may occur if the surface is cleaned and then re-exposed to UV radiation.
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Off-white, slightly translucent. 2. Early Stage: Pale yellow or cream. 3. Moderate
            Degradation: Chalky white with hints of gray. 4. Advanced Degradation: Yellowish-brown, sometimes with rust-colored
            staining from oxidized binder. 5. Severe Degradation: Mottled gray and white, with dark brown or black patches
            where binder has fully decomposed.'
          common_patterns: The photodegradation typically starts as a thin, hazy film that gradually thickens and becomes
            more opaque. Common patterns include localized spots, streaks, and a general chalky coating. Edges and areas exposed
            to direct sunlight are often the first to show signs of degradation. Crevices may accumulate loose chalking material.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier on edges and corners due to stress concentration and
            higher UV exposure. Top surfaces exposed to direct sunlight will have a higher concentration than sheltered areas.
            Crevices may accumulate loose chalking material, leading to localized high concentrations.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10%): Slight haze or discoloration, barely noticeable. Thickness: <10 μm. 2. Light
            (10-30%): Patchy white film, easily rubbed off. Thickness: 10-50 μm. 3. Moderate (30-60%): Visible chalky coating,
            significant color change. Thickness: 50-150 μm. 4. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, opaque coating, significant texture
            change. Thickness: 150-300 μm. 5. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, potential cracking of the underlying
            polymer. Thickness: >300 μm.'
          description: UV photodegradation on polypropylene manifests as a chalky, often white or yellowish, surface layer.
            This layer is composed of degraded polymer fragments, TiO₂, ZnO, CaCO₃, and oxidized binder residues. The coverage
            is often uneven, starting in areas exposed to the most UV radiation and mechanical stress.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating (rare, only in controlled UV exposure).
            2. Edge accumulation (common due to stress concentration and UV exposure). 3. Point source spreading (if a specific
            area is more exposed). 4. Gradient from source (UV source or stress point). 5. Patchy/spotty (most common, uneven
            UV exposure). 6. Streaky/linear (due to water runoff or mechanical abrasion).'
          edge_center_behavior: UV Photodegradation / Polymer Chalking preferentially accumulates at edges due to stress concentration
            and increased UV exposure. The center areas may show degradation, but it is typically less severe than at the
            edges. This is due to the edges being more susceptible to environmental factors.
          geometry_effects: The photodegradation accumulates in corners and builds up in crevices due to reduced airflow and
            potential accumulation of moisture. Flat areas experience more uniform degradation, while vertical surfaces may
            exhibit drip marks from water runoff carrying away loose chalking material. Edges are preferential sites for initiation
            due to stress concentration.
          gravity_influence: Gravity affects the distribution by causing downward flow of water, leading to pooling at bottom
            edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common due to rainwater washing away the chalky
            material. Settling of loose particles occurs on horizontal surfaces.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears matte and highly reflective, often creating
            a glare. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the unevenness of the coating and highlights the chalky texture.
            There is no significant sheen or iridescence; the surface is primarily diffuse.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface may feel slightly rough or gritty. As degradation progresses, it becomes
            increasingly powdery and chalky to the touch. The texture can range from a fine, easily removable dust to a more
            adherent, crusty layer, depending on the binder content and environmental conditions. Close inspection may reveal
            a fine, granular structure.
          thickness_range: The thickness ranges from a few micrometers (μm) in the early stages to several hundred micrometers
            (up to 1 mm) in advanced stages. It can be described as ranging from 'paper-thin' to 'thin coating'.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (early stages). 2. Thick crusts (advanced stages,
            especially in sheltered areas). 3. Discrete patches (uneven UV exposure). 4. Spots/dots (localized degradation).
            5. Stains (from oxidized binder). 6. Uniform coatings (rare). 7. Buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity
            is rare. The non-uniformity is caused by variations in UV exposure, surface temperature, mechanical stress, and
            the presence of imperfections or contaminants on the original surface.
        pvc:
          aged_appearance: Fresh chalking (days/weeks) appears as a thin, easily removable white powder. Aged chalking (months/years)
            becomes thicker, more tightly bound, and may exhibit discoloration (yellowing or graying) due to binder oxidation
            and dirt accumulation. The aged surface is more prone to cracking and flaking.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin, transparent film (hours). 2. Becomes
            a visible white haze (days). 3. Thickens into a chalky layer (weeks). 4. Spreads from edges and corners inward
            (months). 5. Develops cracks and flakes in severe cases (years). Seasonal variations in UV exposure can accelerate
            or decelerate the process.'
          color_variations: 1. Bright White (fresh chalking, high TiO₂ concentration). 2. Off-White/Cream (slightly aged,
            binder oxidation). 3. Light Gray (moderate degradation, accumulation of dirt). 4. Yellowish-Gray (advanced degradation,
            significant binder oxidation). 5. Mottled Gray/Brown (severe degradation, fungal/algal growth on chalked surface).
          common_patterns: The degradation often starts as a uniform haze, then progresses to localized spots and patches.
            Areas exposed to direct sunlight exhibit more pronounced chalking. Edges and corners, due to increased UV exposure
            and potential stress concentrations, tend to show earlier and heavier chalking. Vertical surfaces may exhibit
            streaking due to rain washing away some of the chalk.
          concentration_variations: 'Concentration is typically higher on: 1. Edges and corners. 2. Top surfaces (more sunlight
            exposure). 3. Exposed areas. 4. Areas with surface imperfections. Concentration is lower on: 1. Sheltered areas.
            2. Bottom surfaces. 3. Areas protected by overhangs.'
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10% coverage): Light dusting, barely visible, thickness <5 µm. 2. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable white haze, easily wiped off, thickness 5-20 µm. 3. Moderate (30-60%): Distinct chalky appearance,
            requires effort to remove, thickness 20-100 µm. 4. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, easily visible layer, significant color
            change, thickness 100-500 µm. 5. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, crusty layer, potential for cracking and flaking,
            thickness >500 µm.'
          description: UV photodegradation on PVC manifests as a chalky, often white or grayish, surface layer. This layer
            is a result of polymer degradation and the release of additives like TiO₂. The coverage is often uneven, with
            more pronounced chalking on surfaces directly exposed to sunlight.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Uniform coating (early stages). 2. Edge accumulation
            (due to higher UV exposure). 3. Patchy/spotty (uneven degradation). 4. Streaky/linear (water runoff). 5. Gradient
            from source (decreasing chalking with distance from direct sunlight). 6. Localized concentrations (around imperfections
            or stress points).'
          edge_center_behavior: UV Photodegradation / Polymer Chalking preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased
            UV exposure and stress concentrations. The center areas tend to chalk more uniformly but often to a lesser extent
            than the edges. The perimeter is often heavily affected.
          geometry_effects: 'Surface geometry significantly affects distribution: 1. Accumulates in corners (higher UV exposure).
            2. Builds up in crevices (trapped debris and moisture). 3. Drips on vertical surfaces (water runoff). 4. Collects
            at edges (higher UV exposure and stress). 5. Follows contours (uneven UV exposure).'
          gravity_influence: 'Gravity influences the distribution through: 1. Downward flow behavior (water carrying chalk
            particles). 2. Pooling at bottom edges (accumulation of chalky runoff). 3. Drip marks from top to bottom (vertical
            streaking). 4. Settling on horizontal surfaces (accumulation of chalk particles).'
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the chalked surface appears matte and highly reflective, often causing
            glare. Indoor fluorescent lighting reveals the unevenness of the chalking and any underlying discoloration. The
            chalked surface lacks gloss and does not exhibit iridescence.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface might feel slightly rough or powdery. With increasing degradation, the texture
            becomes distinctly chalky, easily transferring to the touch. The surface loses its original smoothness and develops
            a fine, granular feel. In advanced stages, it can become crusty and brittle.
          thickness_range: The chalked layer can range from a few micrometers (µm) in the initial stages to several hundred
            micrometers (µm) or even a millimeter (mm) in severe cases. A freshly chalked surface might have a layer less
            than 10 µm thick, while a heavily chalked surface can reach 0.5-1 mm.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Thin films (early stages). 2. Thick crusts (advanced degradation).
            3. Discrete patches (localized degradation). 4. Spots/dots (initial degradation points). 5. Stains (discoloration
            due to binder oxidation). 6. Uniform coatings (early stages, light chalking). 7. Buildups (at edges and corners).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Perfectly uniform
            chalking is rare, as UV exposure and environmental factors vary across the surface. The presence of pigments,
            stabilizers, and other additives also influences the degradation rate locally.

        cedar:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination may appear as subtle discoloration or staining, with minimal textural change.
            Aged contamination exhibits significant color darkening, extensive surface degradation, and a pronounced softening
            of the wood. The affected area may become deeply pitted and structurally weakened. The presence of fruiting bodies
            (mushrooms or conks) indicates advanced decay.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film of discoloration (hours/days), then
            thickens and softens the wood (days/weeks). Begins at contact points with moisture and spreads outward (weeks/months).
            Starts at edges and moves inward, following the grain (months/years). Layering effects may occur due to seasonal
            variations in moisture and temperature. Point sources expand outward, creating localized areas of severe decay.'
          color_variations: Fresh rot often presents as a muted reddish-brown, similar to a faded cedar color (#A0522D), progressing
            to darker browns like umber (#8A3324) or sienna (#A75330). Advanced decay can exhibit grayish tones (#808080)
            or even black (#000000) due to melanin production by certain fungi. Some species may produce yellowish or greenish
            hues (#9ACD32) in early stages.
          common_patterns: Rot typically initiates in areas with high moisture content, such as cracks, knots, and end grain.
            It often spreads along the grain of the wood, creating elongated patches or streaks. In advanced stages, it can
            form distinct pockets or cavities within the wood structure.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners, especially those exposed to moisture.
            Top surfaces may exhibit more rot than bottom surfaces due to water accumulation. Crevices and cracks provide
            ideal environments for fungal growth, leading to higher concentrations in these areas.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): subtle discoloration, minimal textural change, thickness <50 μm. Light
            (10-30%): noticeable discoloration, slight softening of the wood, thickness 50-100 μm. Moderate (30-60%): significant
            discoloration, moderate softening, thickness 100-500 μm. Heavy (60-85%): extensive discoloration, significant
            structural degradation, thickness 0.5-2 mm. Extreme (>85%): widespread decay, severe structural damage, thickness
            >2 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on cedar manifests as discoloration and textural changes, ranging from subtle staining to
            significant surface degradation. The color shifts from the natural reddish-brown of cedar to shades of brown,
            gray, and sometimes black, accompanied by softening and crumbling of the wood structure. Coverage varies from
            localized spots to extensive surface involvement.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (especially at cut ends), point
            source spreading (from knots or cracks), patchy/spotty distribution (due to uneven moisture exposure), streaky/linear
            patterns (following the wood grain), and localized concentrations (in areas with poor ventilation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges, especially cut ends, due to increased moisture
            absorption and exposure to fungal spores. The center areas may be less susceptible due to lower moisture content
            and better ventilation. However, rot can spread inward from the edges over time.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Rot accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture retention. Flat areas may exhibit pooling of water, promoting fungal growth. Edges are vulnerable
            due to increased exposure to moisture and air. Depressions and cracks provide sheltered environments for fungal
            colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a role in the downward flow of moisture, leading to pooling at bottom edges and
            drip marks on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common due to water runoff carrying fungal spores and nutrients.
            Settling of spores and decayed wood particles on horizontal surfaces contributes to increased rot in these areas.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the discolored areas may appear more pronounced, with a matte finish. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting can highlight the textural irregularities and variations in color. Wet rot may exhibit a
            slight sheen due to surface moisture. Dry rot typically has a dull, matte appearance.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture may remain relatively smooth, but as decay progresses, the surface becomes
            increasingly rough and uneven. The wood fibers soften and become spongy, easily crumbling under pressure. Advanced
            rot can result in a powdery or flaky surface texture. Fungal hyphae may be visible as fine, thread-like structures,
            sometimes forming a felt-like mat.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies depending on the severity of the rot. Early stages may
            involve a surface layer of only 50-200 μm. Advanced decay can penetrate several millimeters or even centimeters
            into the wood, resulting in significant structural loss.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: stains (early discoloration), discrete patches (localized fungal
            colonies), spots/dots (initial infection points), buildups (accumulation of decayed wood and fungal biomass),
            and cavities (advanced decay resulting in structural loss). Drip marks may be present on vertical surfaces due
            to water runoff carrying fungal spores and nutrients.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare due to variations in moisture content, wood density, and fungal colonization patterns. Areas with better
            ventilation and lower moisture levels will exhibit less rot.
        cherry:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as subtle darkening and slight softening of the wood. Aged contamination
            (months/years) exhibits significant color changes (darker browns, grays, greens), pronounced textural changes
            (soft, crumbly, powdery), and increased thickness of the affected area. The wood may exhibit deep cracks and structural
            weakening. The presence of fruiting bodies (mushrooms or other fungal structures) indicates advanced decay.
          buildup_progression: 'Buildup progresses as follows: starts as a thin film of discoloration (hours/days), then thickens
            as the fungi penetrate deeper into the wood (days/weeks). Begins at contact points with moisture and spreads outward.
            Starts at edges and moves inward. Uniform gradual accumulation is less common than point sources that expand outward.
            Layering effects may occur with repeated wetting and drying cycles. Seasonal variations in moisture content can
            influence the rate of decay.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh rot often starts as a subtle darkening, resembling a bruise, with colors like #8B4513 (SaddleBrown)
            or a slightly muted version of the original cherry color. As it progresses, colors shift to #654321 (DarkBrown),
            #4A4A4A (Charcoal Gray), and in advanced stages, may exhibit greenish-black areas around the fungal growth points,
            approximating #2E8B57 (SeaGreen) due to secondary metabolites. Some areas may show a yellowish-brown discoloration
            (#C04000) due to cellulose degradation.'
          common_patterns: Rot typically initiates in areas with high moisture content, such as end grain, joints, or areas
            exposed to prolonged dampness. It often appears as localized spots or patches that gradually expand outward. In
            some cases, it may follow the grain of the wood, creating linear streaks or patterns. Accumulation is common in
            crevices and corners where moisture tends to collect.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain may exhibit more extensive decay than sheltered undersides. Vertical walls may show
            drip marks and streaks of discoloration. Flat surfaces can accumulate standing water, leading to more uniform
            decay across the surface.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of discoloration, slight softening of the wood. Light (10-30%):
            Scattered patches of discoloration and softening, typically less than 1 mm thick. Moderate (30-60%): Significant
            discoloration and softening, with some structural weakening, 1-3 mm thick. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive decay, significant
            structural damage, easily removable rotted material, 3-5 mm thick. Extreme (>85%): Widespread and deep decay,
            severe structural failure, wood is largely reduced to a soft, crumbly mass, >5 mm thick.'
          description: Wood rot on cherry presents as a discoloration and textural change, ranging from subtle staining to
            significant structural degradation. The color shifts from the natural reddish-brown of cherry to darker browns,
            grays, and sometimes greenish hues, often accompanied by a softening or crumbling of the wood surface. Coverage
            varies from localized spots to extensive areas depending on moisture levels and fungal species.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized spots expanding outward, edge accumulation
            (especially on end grain), point source spreading from knots or cracks, patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven
            moisture exposure, and streaky/linear patterns following the wood grain. Edge accumulation and point source spreading
            are particularly common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges, especially end grain, due to increased moisture
            absorption. The center areas may be affected later as the rot spreads inward. Uniform distribution is less common
            unless the entire surface is consistently exposed to high moisture levels.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Rot accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to moisture trapping. Flat areas pool water, promoting uniform decay. Vertical surfaces exhibit drip marks. Edges
            are particularly vulnerable due to exposed end grain. Depressions and imperfections provide ideal environments
            for fungal growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow of water leads to pooling at
            bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling of moisture on horizontal
            surfaces promotes decay. Runs down slopes are observed. Hanging from overhead surfaces is not applicable in this
            context.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the affected areas may appear dull and matte due to the loss of surface
            integrity. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the color variations and textural irregularities. The rotted
            areas typically lack the sheen of healthy cherry wood and may appear more porous and absorbent. No iridescence
            or rainbow effects are typically observed.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture may remain relatively smooth, but as the rot progresses, the surface becomes
            increasingly rough and uneven. The wood fibers lose their integrity, resulting in a soft, spongy, or crumbly texture.
            Advanced stages can exhibit a powdery or flaky surface, easily detached with light pressure. Fungal hyphae may
            be visible as fine, thread-like structures on the surface or within cracks.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies depending on the stage of decay. Early stages may involve
            a surface discoloration of only 25-100 μm. Advanced decay can result in a layer of rotted wood that is several
            millimeters thick (1-5 mm or more), easily removed by hand.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: stains (early discoloration), discrete patches of softened wood,
            spots/dots of fungal growth, thin films of discoloration, thick crusts of decayed material in advanced stages,
            drip marks on vertical surfaces, and buildups in corners and crevices. No crystalline structures are typically
            observed.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. This is due
            to variations in moisture content, wood density, and the presence of defects or imperfections that provide entry
            points for fungi. Perfectly uniform distribution is rare.
        maple:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as subtle staining and slight softening of the wood. Aged contamination
            (months/years) exhibits significant discoloration, structural weakening, and the presence of visible fungal growth.
            The color darkens, the texture becomes more porous and crumbly, and the affected area expands. The wood may also
            develop a musty or earthy odor.
          buildup_progression: The progression starts as a thin film (hours/days) of fungal hyphae on the surface. It then
            thickens (days/weeks) as the fungi penetrate the wood and degrade the cellulose and lignin. The decay begins at
            contact points (e.g., edges, cracks) and spreads inward (weeks/months). Layering effects may occur due to seasonal
            variations in moisture exposure. Point sources expand outward over time (months/years).
          color_variations: Fresh rot often presents as a light tan or yellowish-brown (#D2B48C), progressing to darker shades
            of brown (#8B4513, saddle brown) and eventually incorporating greyish-black hues (#4A4A4A) as melanin and other
            pigments accumulate. Advanced decay can exhibit reddish-brown tones (#A52A2A, brown) due to iron oxidation catalyzed
            by fungal activity. Some areas may show a greenish tint due to the presence of specific fungal species.
          common_patterns: Wood rot typically initiates at points of moisture accumulation, such as edges, cracks, and areas
            in contact with the ground or other damp materials. It spreads outwards from these points, often following the
            grain of the wood. In early stages, it may appear as localized spots or streaks. Advanced decay can result in
            extensive areas of softened or crumbling wood.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and crevices where moisture accumulates.
            Top surfaces may be less affected than bottom surfaces due to gravity. Exposed areas are often more susceptible
            than sheltered areas due to increased moisture exposure. The gradient typically decreases from the point of moisture
            ingress.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): small, isolated spots of discoloration, thickness < 50 μm. Light (10-30%):
            more numerous spots and streaks, slight softening of the wood, thickness 50-200 μm. Moderate (30-60%): significant
            discoloration and softening, visible fungal growth, thickness 200 μm - 1 mm. Heavy (60-85%): extensive decay,
            crumbling and flaking, significant structural loss, thickness 1-5 mm. Extreme (>85%): widespread destruction,
            large cavities and voids, thickness > 5 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on maple manifests as discoloration and textural changes, ranging from subtle staining to
            significant structural degradation. The color shifts from light browns to darker, mottled shades, often accompanied
            by a softening or crumbling of the wood surface. Coverage varies from localized spots to extensive decay.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (especially at the bottom edge),
            point source spreading (from knots or cracks), gradient from source (decreasing decay intensity with distance
            from the moisture source), patchy/spotty (early stages), and streaky/linear (following the wood grain).'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges due to moisture wicking and capillary action.
            The mechanism involves increased surface area for moisture absorption and reduced airflow for drying.
          geometry_effects: Wood rot accumulates in corners and crevices due to moisture trapping. It builds up in crevices
            and pools on flat areas. Drips occur on vertical surfaces. The decay often follows contours and bridges gaps between
            adjacent wood members.
          gravity_influence: Gravity significantly affects the distribution. Downward flow behavior results in pooling at
            bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common. Settling occurs on horizontal surfaces.
            Runs down slopes are also observed.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, decayed areas may appear bleached or faded compared to the surrounding
            wood. Indoor fluorescent lighting can accentuate the color variations and textural differences. Decayed wood typically
            has a matte finish due to its increased porosity and reduced reflectivity. There is generally no iridescence or
            gloss unless specific fungal species produce surface coatings.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture may remain relatively smooth, with subtle staining. As decay progresses,
            the wood becomes softer and more porous, developing a spongy or fibrous feel. Advanced stages exhibit crumbling,
            flaking, and the formation of visible fungal hyphae, creating a rough, uneven surface. The decayed wood loses
            its original hardness and density.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies depending on the severity of the decay. Early stages
            may involve a surface layer of only 25-100 μm. Advanced decay can penetrate several millimeters or even centimeters
            into the wood, resulting in significant structural loss. Heavily decayed areas may crumble away, leaving behind
            cavities or voids.
          typical_formations: Typical formations include stains, discrete patches, spots/dots (early stages), thin films (initial
            colonization), thick crusts (advanced decay with fungal buildup), and buildups (accumulation of decayed wood particles).
            Drip marks and runs/streaks may be present on vertical surfaces.
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniform decay
            across the entire surface is rare. The level of uniformity depends on the moisture exposure and the presence of
            defects or vulnerabilities in the wood.
        mdf:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (hours/days) appears as subtle discoloration and a slight softening of the
            surface. Aged contamination (months/years) exhibits significant darkening, deep surface erosion, and a powdery
            or crumbly texture. The affected area may also exhibit a noticeable odor. The thickness of the degraded layer
            increases over time.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: (1) Starts as a thin film of discoloration (hours/days).
            (2) Begins at contact points with moisture and spreads outward (days/weeks). (3) Edges are affected first, then
            the rot moves inward (weeks/months). (4) Uniform gradual accumulation occurs under consistent high humidity (months).
            (5) Point sources expand outward, creating patchy patterns (weeks/months). Layering effects can occur due to fluctuating
            moisture levels and seasonal variations (months/years).'
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often starts as a light yellow-brown (#D2B48C, tan) or a muted olive-green
            (#808000). As it ages, it progresses to darker shades of brown (#A0522D, sienna), reddish-brown (#B7410E, rust),
            and eventually black (#000000) in areas of severe degradation. A grayish-blue hue (#778899, lightSlateGray) can
            also appear due to mold growth.
          common_patterns: Wood rot on MDF typically starts at edges, corners, and areas exposed to moisture. It often spreads
            in irregular patches or streaks, following the grain of the MDF (if any is visible) or areas of higher porosity.
            Accumulation is common in crevices and depressions where moisture can collect.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners, and the bottom of vertical surfaces
            due to gravity-driven moisture accumulation. Crevices and depressions also tend to have higher concentrations.
            Flat surfaces may exhibit more uniform but generally lighter contamination compared to edges.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of discoloration, thickness < 25 μm. Light (10-30%): Patches
            of discoloration, slight surface softening, thickness 25-100 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration,
            powdery texture in some areas, thickness 100-500 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration, significant surface
            erosion, thickness 0.5-2 mm. Extreme (>85%): Complete surface degradation, loss of structural integrity, thickness
            > 2 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on MDF manifests as discoloration and textural changes, ranging from subtle staining to significant
            surface degradation. Dominant colors are typically shades of brown, yellow, and black, often with a mottled or
            patchy distribution. The surface texture can vary from slightly softened to deeply eroded and powdery.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (most common), point source spreading
            (from water damage), patchy/spotty (due to uneven moisture exposure), streaky/linear (following grain or surface
            imperfections), and localized concentrations (in corners and crevices).'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased exposure to moisture and fungal
            spores. The center areas may remain relatively unaffected in the early stages. The mechanism is primarily driven
            by the higher surface area to volume ratio at edges, leading to faster moisture absorption and evaporation cycles
            that favor fungal growth.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Accumulation occurs in corners and crevices
            due to moisture trapping. Buildup is common in crevices. Pooling occurs on flat areas. Drips form on vertical
            surfaces. Edges are particularly susceptible due to increased exposure.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution pattern. Downward flow behavior is evident
            in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom edges. Settling of spores and moisture on horizontal
            surfaces contributes to increased contamination.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the affected areas may appear more faded and the textural irregularities
            are more pronounced. Under indoor fluorescent lighting, the darker shades of brown and black may be more prominent.
            The surface finish can range from matte to slightly glossy depending on the moisture content and the presence
            of fungal exudates. No iridescence is expected.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface may feel slightly softened or spongy. As degradation progresses, the texture
            becomes rough, uneven, and often powdery or crumbly. Advanced rot can lead to deep fissures and a loss of structural
            integrity. Fungal hyphae may be visible as fine, thread-like structures, especially in humid conditions. The surface
            can also become sticky due to the presence of moisture-bound organics.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer can range from a thin film of discoloration (10-50 μm) in early
            stages to a significant buildup of degraded material (1-5 mm or more) in advanced stages. In extreme cases, the
            entire MDF board can be compromised.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: stains (early stage), discrete patches (localized growth), spots/dots
            (initial colonization), thin films (surface growth), thick crusts (advanced degradation), and buildups (at edges
            and corners). Drip marks and runs/streaks are common on vertical surfaces.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniform distribution
            is rare unless the entire MDF board is consistently exposed to high humidity and fungal spores. The level of uniformity
            depends on the consistency of moisture exposure and the presence of surface imperfections.
        oak:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rot (days) appears as subtle discoloration and slight softening of the wood. Aged rot (months/years)
            exhibits significant color changes (darker browns, blacks), increased surface roughness, and structural weakening.
            The affected area may become noticeably sunken or deformed. The buildup of fungal biomass and degradation products
            can create a crusty or layered appearance.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: (Hours/Days) Starts as a thin film of moisture and fungal
            spores on the surface. (Days/Weeks) Begins at contact points with moisture sources and spreads outward. (Weeks/Months)
            Discoloration becomes more pronounced, and the wood softens. (Months/Years) The affected area thickens, becomes
            spongy, and eventually crumbles. Layering effects may occur due to repeated wetting and drying cycles. Seasonal
            variations in moisture content can accelerate or slow down the process.'
          color_variations: Fresh rot often presents as a light tan or yellowish-brown (#D2B48C), progressing to a deeper
            reddish-brown (#A0522D) as decay advances. Advanced stages can exhibit dark brown to almost black areas (#301919)
            due to melanin production by fungi. Some areas may show a greenish tint (#8FBC8F) if mold is present. A characteristic
            'foxing' effect can occur, with rust-orange halos (#B7410E) surrounding darker spots.
          common_patterns: Rot typically initiates in areas with high moisture content, such as end grain, cracks, or areas
            in contact with the ground. It often spreads along the grain, creating elongated patches or streaks. Localized
            spots or patches are common, especially around knots or other imperfections. In advanced stages, the entire surface
            may be affected.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners where moisture accumulates. Top
            surfaces exposed to rain may have higher concentrations than sheltered undersides. Crevices and cracks provide
            ideal environments for fungal growth, leading to localized high concentrations. Vertical walls may exhibit a gradient
            of rot severity, with the most severe damage at the bottom.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots of discoloration, barely perceptible softening. Light (10-30%):
            Small patches of discoloration and slight softening, thickness < 0.5 mm. Moderate (30-60%): Noticeable discoloration
            and softening, thickness 0.5-2 mm. Heavy (60-85%): Significant discoloration, spongy texture, thickness 2-5 mm.
            Extreme (>85%): Extensive decay, structural weakening, thickness > 5 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on oak manifests as discoloration and textural changes, ranging from subtle staining to significant
            structural degradation. Colors vary from light tan to dark brown, often with a mottled or patchy appearance. The
            surface texture transitions from smooth to soft, spongy, or even crumbling as the rot progresses.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: localized spots around moisture sources, edge accumulation
            where water collects, point source spreading from fungal entry points, gradient from source with decreasing severity,
            patchy/spotty distribution due to uneven moisture exposure, streaky/linear patterns following the grain, and localized
            concentrations in areas with poor ventilation.'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased moisture exposure and air circulation,
            which favors fungal growth. The perimeter of a wooden object is often the first area to show signs of decay. This
            is because edges are more susceptible to water absorption and evaporation, creating a favorable environment for
            fungi.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Rot accumulates in corners and crevices due
            to moisture trapping. Flat areas may exhibit pooling of water and subsequent rot. Vertical surfaces show drip
            marks and streaks. Edges are particularly vulnerable due to increased exposure to moisture and air.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role in the distribution of moisture and fungal spores. Downward
            flow behavior leads to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks from top to bottom. Vertical streaking is common.
            Settling on horizontal surfaces promotes rot development. Runs down slopes exacerbate the problem.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, rotted areas tend to appear dull and matte due to the loss of surface integrity.
            Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight color variations and textural differences. Wet rot may exhibit a slight
            sheen or gloss due to surface moisture. Dry rot typically has a matte finish.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface may feel slightly softer than unaffected oak. As rot progresses, the texture
            becomes spongy, fibrous, and easily indented. Advanced decay results in a crumbly, powdery, or even slimy texture.
            The original wood grain may become obscured or distorted. Fungal hyphae may be visible as fine, thread-like structures
            on the surface or within cracks.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies significantly depending on the stage of decay. Early-stage
            rot may only penetrate a few micrometers (25-100 μm). Advanced rot can extend several millimeters (2-10 mm) or
            even centimeters into the wood.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: stains (early stage discoloration), discrete patches of softened
            wood, spots/dots of fungal growth, thin films of fungal biomass, thick crusts of decayed material, buildups in
            crevices, and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Advanced decay can lead to the formation of cavities and structural
            collapse.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniform distribution
            is rare, as rot is driven by localized moisture and nutrient availability. Variations are caused by differences
            in wood density, grain orientation, and exposure to environmental factors.
        pine:
          aged_appearance: Fresh rot (days/weeks) typically presents as subtle discoloration and slight softening of the wood.
            Aged rot (months/years) exhibits significant color changes, extensive structural damage, and a pronounced softening
            or crumbling texture. The affected area may become deeply pitted and exhibit a loss of structural integrity. The
            color darkens significantly.
          buildup_progression: The buildup typically starts as a thin film of surface discoloration within hours/days of exposure
            to moisture and fungal spores. It then thickens and spreads outward from the initial contact points over days/weeks.
            Over months, the rot penetrates deeper into the wood, causing significant structural damage. Seasonal variations
            in moisture and temperature can accelerate or slow down the process.
          color_variations: Fresh rot often starts with a yellowish-brown hue (#D2B48C, tan) or a light olive-brown (#A88F59).
            As it progresses, it transitions to a deeper reddish-brown (#8B4513, saddle brown), eventually darkening to a
            dark brown (#654321, dark chocolate) or even a grayish-black (#4A4A4A) in advanced stages. Some fungal species
            may introduce green or blue-green tinges.
          common_patterns: Rot commonly initiates in areas with high moisture content, such as edges, corners, and areas in
            contact with the ground or other wet materials. It can spread in irregular patches, streaks, or drip patterns,
            often following the grain of the wood. In some cases, it may form distinct zones of decay with clear boundaries.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges and corners, especially those exposed to moisture.
            The bottom surfaces of horizontal members often exhibit higher concentrations due to water pooling. Crevices and
            cracks also provide ideal environments for fungal growth and accumulation.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10%): Subtle discoloration, slight softening. Light (10-30%): Noticeable discoloration,
            minor texture changes, thickness < 0.5 mm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration, softening, visible structural
            damage, thickness 0.5-2 mm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive discoloration, crumbling texture, significant structural
            loss, thickness 2-5 mm. Extreme (>85%): Severe decay, complete structural failure, thickness > 5 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on pine manifests as discoloration and texture changes, ranging from subtle staining to significant
            structural degradation. The color shifts from light yellows and browns to darker browns, grays, and even black,
            often accompanied by a softening or crumbling of the wood surface. Coverage patterns are typically uneven, influenced
            by moisture and nutrient availability.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation (especially at cut ends), point
            source spreading (from nail holes or cracks), patchy/spotty distribution (due to uneven moisture), streaky/linear
            patterns (following the grain), and localized concentrations (in areas with poor ventilation).'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges, especially cut ends, due to increased moisture
            absorption and exposure to fungal spores. The center areas may be affected later, as the rot spreads inward. This
            is due to the capillary action of wood drawing moisture from the edges.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly influences distribution. Rot accumulates in corners and crevices
            due to moisture retention. Flat areas may exhibit pooling of water and subsequent fungal growth. Edges are vulnerable
            due to increased exposure to moisture and air. Depressions and cracks provide sheltered environments for fungal
            colonization.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a role in the downward flow of moisture, leading to pooling at bottom edges and
            drip marks on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common due to water runoff carrying fungal spores and nutrients.
            Horizontal surfaces tend to accumulate moisture and debris, promoting fungal growth.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the affected areas may appear more faded or bleached, while the texture
            becomes more pronounced. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the color variations and surface irregularities.
            The rot typically exhibits a matte finish, with little to no sheen or gloss. Wet rot may appear slightly glossy.
          texture_details: Initially, the texture may remain relatively smooth, but as the rot advances, the wood becomes
            softer and more porous. It can feel spongy, crumbly, or even powdery to the touch. Advanced rot often exhibits
            a distinct fibrous or stringy texture due to the breakdown of the wood's structure. Surface may exhibit a matte
            finish.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies depending on the severity of the rot. Early stages may
            involve a surface film of only a few micrometers (5-50 μm). Advanced rot can penetrate several millimeters (2-10
            mm) or even centimeters into the wood, depending on the species of fungi and environmental conditions.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: stains (early stages), discrete patches (localized decay), spots/dots
            (initial fungal colonies), thin films (surface growth), thick crusts (advanced decay with mineral deposition),
            drip marks (from water runoff carrying fungal spores), and buildups (in areas with persistent moisture).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare due to variations in moisture content, wood density, and fungal colonization patterns. Areas with consistent
            moisture exposure will exhibit more uniform decay.
        plywood:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as subtle discoloration and slight softening of the wood. Aged
            contamination (months/years) results in significant color change, deep fissures, and a crumbly or spongy texture.
            The wood loses its structural integrity and may exhibit a characteristic musty odor. The affected area becomes
            more pronounced and easily distinguishable from the surrounding healthy wood.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1. Starts as a thin film of discoloration (hours/days).
            2. Begins at contact points (edges, corners) and spreads outward (days/weeks). 3. Thickens over time, leading
            to softening and structural damage (weeks/months). 4. Uniform gradual accumulation may occur on horizontal surfaces
            exposed to consistent moisture. 5. Point sources expand outward, creating circular or irregular patterns. 6. Layering
            effects may be observed with alternating wet and dry periods. Seasonal variations in humidity and temperature
            influence the rate of decay.'
          color_variations: '1. Fresh: Pale yellow-brown (#F0E68C), resembling a light stain. 2. Early Stage: Tan with hints
            of orange (#D2B48C), often concentrated along grain lines. 3. Moderate: Rust-brown (#A0522D) with darker brown
            (#8B4513) edges where moisture accumulates. 4. Advanced: Dark brown to almost black (#301900), indicating significant
            cellulose and lignin degradation. 5. Dry Rot: Grayish-brown (#808080) with a powdery or crumbly texture.'
          common_patterns: Rot typically starts at edges, corners, and areas exposed to prolonged moisture. It spreads along
            the wood grain, creating streaks and irregular patches. In some cases, it may appear as localized spots or circular
            patterns radiating from a central point of infection. Accumulation is often seen in crevices and areas where water
            can pool.
          concentration_variations: Concentration is generally higher at edges and corners, where moisture tends to accumulate.
            Top surfaces exposed to rain or condensation will have higher concentrations than sheltered areas. Crevices and
            areas with poor ventilation also promote higher concentrations. Vertical surfaces may exhibit a gradient, with
            higher concentrations at the bottom due to gravity-driven water flow.
          coverage_ranges: '1. Sparse (<10%): Isolated spots of discoloration, 10-50 μm thick. 2. Light (10-30%): Patches
            of discoloration along grain lines, 50-200 μm thick. 3. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration with some
            softening of the wood, 0.2-1 mm thick. 4. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive decay with deep fissures and significant material
            loss, 1-5 mm thick. 5. Extreme (>85%): Complete structural failure of the wood, >5 mm thick.'
          description: Wood rot on plywood manifests as discoloration, ranging from light staining to deep, textured decay.
            The color shifts from pale yellows and browns to dark, almost black, areas as the rot progresses. Fungal growth
            often follows the wood grain, creating streaks and patches of varying intensity.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1. Edge accumulation: Higher concentration along edges
            due to moisture absorption. 2. Point source spreading: Circular or irregular patterns radiating from a single
            point of infection. 3. Streaky/linear: Following the wood grain. 4. Patchy/spotty: Irregularly distributed areas
            of decay. 5. Gradient from source: Decreasing intensity away from the moisture source. Edge accumulation and streaky/linear
            patterns are most common.'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges due to increased moisture absorption and exposure.
            The center areas may remain relatively unaffected in the early stages. The perimeter often exhibits a higher concentration
            of decay compared to the interior. This is due to the edges being the primary point of contact with environmental
            moisture.
          geometry_effects: Rot accumulates in corners and crevices due to moisture trapping. Flat areas may exhibit pooling
            of water, leading to localized decay. Edges are particularly vulnerable due to increased surface area exposed
            to moisture. Depressions and imperfections in the wood surface can also promote localized rot.
          gravity_influence: Gravity causes downward flow of water, leading to pooling at bottom edges and drip marks on vertical
            surfaces. Horizontal surfaces are prone to settling of spores and moisture, promoting uniform or patchy decay.
            Slopes exhibit runs down the surface, creating streaky patterns. Overhead surfaces may exhibit hanging fungal
            growth in humid conditions.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, the discolored areas appear more pronounced, with a matte finish. Indoor
            fluorescent lighting may make the color variations less distinct. Wet rot can exhibit a slight sheen due to surface
            moisture. Dry rot tends to have a dull, matte appearance.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface may feel slightly rougher than the surrounding wood. As the rot progresses,
            the texture becomes increasingly soft, spongy, and easily crumbled. Advanced rot can lead to deep fissures and
            a loss of structural integrity. Fungal hyphae may be visible as fine, thread-like structures, especially in humid
            conditions. The surface can be powdery when dry, or sticky and slimy when wet.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the affected layer varies from a thin film (10-50 μm) in early stages to several
            millimeters (2-10 mm) in advanced decay. In extreme cases, the rot can penetrate the entire thickness of the plywood.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1. Stains: Discoloration without significant texture change. 2.
            Discrete patches: Isolated areas of decay. 3. Spots/dots: Small, localized areas of infection. 4. Thin films:
            Early-stage surface growth. 5. Thick crusts: Advanced decay with significant material loss. 6. Drip marks: Vertical
            streaks caused by water runoff carrying fungal spores and nutrients.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is low because rot is driven by moisture and nutrient availability, which are rarely uniform across the surface.
            Variations in wood density and grain also contribute to uneven distribution.
        walnut:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination (days) appears as light staining with minimal textural change. Aged contamination
            (months/years) exhibits significant darkening, increased roughness, and potential structural weakening. The decayed
            area may become sunken or pitted, with a distinct odor.
          buildup_progression: 'The buildup progresses as follows: 1) Initial colonization by fungal spores. 2) Formation
            of a thin film of mycelium on the surface (hours/days). 3) Penetration of hyphae into the wood fibers, causing
            staining and softening (days/weeks). 4) Gradual thickening of the decayed layer and expansion of the affected
            area (weeks/months). 5) Structural weakening and eventual disintegration of the wood (months/years). Seasonal
            variations in temperature and humidity can accelerate or slow down the process.'
          color_variations: Fresh rot often presents as a light tan (#D2B48C) or yellowish-brown (#C0992E) stain. As it progresses,
            colors deepen to reddish-brown (#A0522D), then to dark brown (#654321) with possible black (#000000) mottling
            in advanced stages. Some areas may exhibit a greenish tint due to specific fungal species.
          common_patterns: Rot typically starts in areas with high moisture content or damage to the wood's protective finish.
            It often appears as localized spots or patches that expand over time. Cracks and crevices are prime locations
            for initial fungal colonization. The pattern can be irregular and influenced by grain direction.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be higher in areas with prolonged moisture exposure, such as the
            bottom edges of vertical surfaces or in crevices where water can accumulate. Exposed end grain absorbs moisture
            more readily, leading to higher concentrations of decay. Sheltered areas with poor ventilation also promote fungal
            growth.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Light staining, minimal textural change, thickness < 25 μm. Light (10-30%):
            Noticeable discoloration, slight softening of the wood, thickness 25-100 μm. Moderate (30-60%): Significant discoloration,
            increased roughness, thickness 100-500 μm. Heavy (60-85%): Extensive decay, crumbling or flaking of the wood,
            thickness 0.5-2 mm. Extreme (>85%): Severe structural damage, significant loss of wood mass, thickness > 2 mm.'
          description: Wood rot on walnut manifests as discoloration, ranging from subtle staining to significant surface
            degradation. The texture shifts from smooth to rough and porous, with coverage varying from scattered spots to
            extensive surface alteration. Color changes are prominent, evolving from light stains to darker, more pronounced
            decay.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: 1) Point source spreading from a knot or crack. 2)
            Edge accumulation along exposed end grain. 3) Patchy/spotty distribution in areas with fluctuating moisture levels.
            4) Streaky/linear patterns following the wood grain. 5) Localized concentrations around fasteners or joints.'
          edge_center_behavior: Wood rot preferentially accumulates at edges, especially exposed end grain, due to increased
            moisture absorption. The center areas may be protected by coatings or have lower moisture content. However, if
            the coating is compromised, rot can spread inwards from the edges or originate from internal defects.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Rot accumulates in corners and crevices where
            moisture tends to collect. Flat areas may exhibit pooling of water, leading to more uniform decay. Edges are vulnerable
            due to increased exposure to moisture and lack of protective coatings. Depressions and indentations trap water
            and debris, promoting fungal growth.
          gravity_influence: Gravity influences the distribution by causing water to flow downwards, leading to pooling at
            bottom edges and drip marks on vertical surfaces. Vertical streaking is common as water carries fungal spores
            and nutrients down the wood surface. Horizontal surfaces are prone to settling of moisture and debris, promoting
            uniform decay.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, decayed areas may appear more faded or bleached compared to the surrounding
            healthy wood. Indoor fluorescent lighting can highlight the textural differences between decayed and sound wood.
            The decayed surface typically has a matte finish due to increased porosity.
          texture_details: Initially, the surface may feel slightly sticky or damp. As decay advances, the texture becomes
            increasingly rough, porous, and spongy. Advanced rot can lead to crumbling or flaking of the wood surface. Microscopic
            examination reveals fungal hyphae and degraded wood fibers.
          thickness_range: The thickness of the decayed layer varies. Initial staining may be only a few micrometers (5-20
            μm) deep. Advanced rot can penetrate several millimeters (1-5 mm) or more, depending on the wood species and environmental
            conditions.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: 1) Stains that penetrate the wood fibers. 2) Discrete patches of
            discoloration and softening. 3) Buildups of fungal mycelium on the surface. 4) Crumbling or flaking of the wood
            in advanced stages. 5) Formation of fruiting bodies (mushrooms or bracket fungi) in severe cases.'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to highly variable/irregular. Uniformity
            is rare due to variations in moisture content, wood density, and the presence of protective coatings. The presence
            of knots, cracks, or other defects significantly influences the distribution.

    - UV chalking requires organic polymers → Only plastics chalk

    description: Contamination must follow physical/chemical laws
    examples:
    - 'Metals corrode differently: iron→rust, copper→patina, aluminum→oxide'
    - Wood rots, metals corrode, plastics degrade - different mechanisms
    - Gravity affects distribution patterns
