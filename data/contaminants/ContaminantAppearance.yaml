# Contaminant Appearance Library
# Modular data file for contaminant_appearance relationship type
#
# Purpose: Visual identification and characteristics by contaminant type
# Impact: Eliminates 8,000+ lines of duplicate data across 98 contaminant files

contaminant_appearance:
  rust-pattern-surface-oxidation:
    id: rust-pattern-surface-oxidation
    contaminant_type: rust
    contaminant_id: rust-iron-oxide-formation
    pattern_name: Surface Oxidation
    severity: light_to_moderate
    
    visual_characteristics:
      color:
        primary: Reddish-brown
        variations: [Orange, brown, dark brown]
        hex_codes: ['#B7410E', '#CD853F', '#8B4513']
        notes: Color darkens with age and thickness
      texture:
        surface: Rough, powdery to flaky
        tactile: Granular when touched
        cohesion: Weak - easily wiped off when light
      pattern:
        distribution: Usually uniform across surface
        common_locations:
          - Edges and corners (moisture accumulation)
          - Weld zones (heat-affected zones)
          - Scratches or damage sites
        progression: Starts as small spots, spreads outward
      surface_effects:
        roughness_increase: Significant (2x-10x base metal)
        typical_ra: 5-50
        unit: μm
        
    physical_properties:
      thickness:
        light: 10-50
        moderate: 50-200
        heavy: 200-1000+
        unit: μm
      density:
        value: 5.0-5.5
        unit: g/cm³
      adhesion: Weak to moderate
      
    identification_tips:
      visual_inspection:
        - Reddish-brown coloration distinct from base metal
        - Powdery or flaky texture
        - May leave residue when touched
      scratch_test: Easily removed with fingernail when light
      
    material_compatibility:
      common_on:
        - Carbon steel
        - Cast iron
        - Wrought iron
      severity_factors:
        high_risk:
          - Marine environments (salt spray)
          - Industrial areas (pollutants)
          - Outdoor exposure
          
    laser_removal_characteristics:
      difficulty: Easy to moderate
      optimal_wavelength: 1064
      unit: nm
      typical_fluence: 2-5
      fluence_unit: J/cm²
      passes_required:
        light: 1-2
        moderate: 2-4
        heavy: 4-8
