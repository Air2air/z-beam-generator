      after: Post-cleaning reveals restored surface with adhesive residue / tape marks
        successfully removed through precise laser ablation.
      before: Surface shows contamination from adhesive residue / tape marks affecting
        material appearance and properties.
    category: contamination
    context_notes: Common on manufactured items, shipped goods, or items with labels/tape
    description: Adhesive-residue contamination forms during shipping or labeling
      processes, and clings tenaciously to metals and plastics. Unlike dust that brushes
      away easily or oils that evaporate quickly, layer hardens over time so tackiness
      persists after exposure. During cleaning, bonds resist solvents, so gentle methods
      apply to prevent surface damage. Buildup is observed as sticky films, distinct
      because it demands careful removal without scratching.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Adhesive residue manifests as a sticky, often translucent layer
            that may appear whitish or yellowish, contrasting with the ceramic's smooth,
            glazed finish.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from small, isolated spots to larger sections,
            with variation due to surface smoothness and adhesive type.
          pattern: It usually forms defined patches or streaks, frequently following
            the shape of the tape and potentially collecting in grout lines or textured
            areas.
        composite:
          appearance: Adhesive residue shows as a sticky film that may be translucent
            or colored, adhering to the varied textures of composite materials and
            possibly highlighting fibers or layers.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and variable, depending on the composite's
            composition and how well the adhesive bonded.
          pattern: It tends to form uneven patches or streaks, influenced by the composite's
            heterogeneous surface, such as along fiber directions or laminate edges.
        concrete:
          appearance: Residue appears as a dark, sticky film that can be gray or brownish,
            often filling the rough pores and contrasting with the concrete's dull
            surface.
          coverage: Coverage is sparse to moderate, highly variable due to concrete's
            roughness and adhesive absorption into pores.
          pattern: It commonly forms irregular patches or smears, concentrated in
            surface imperfections or along former tape lines, with possible dust adherence.
        fabric:
          appearance: Adhesive residue manifests as a stiff, sticky area that can
            be clear or yellowish, often matting fibers and attracting lint or debris.
          coverage: Coverage is usually localized and uneven, with variation based
            on fabric type and how much adhesive penetrated the fibers.
          pattern: It typically forms defined spots or patches, following the weave
            of the fabric and potentially spreading along threads if the adhesive
            seeped in.
        glass:
          appearance: Residue appears as a hazy, sticky film that can be clear or
            slightly cloudy, often with a glossy sheen that obscures the glass's transparency.
          coverage: Coverage is often extensive and uniform if tape was applied broadly,
            but can vary with application technique.
          pattern: It typically forms uniform streaks or patches, sometimes with distinct
            tape edges or air bubble marks, and may show fingerprint smudges.
        metal:
          appearance: Adhesive residue appears as a translucent to opaque film, often
            yellowish or grayish, with a sticky or gummy texture that contrasts with
            the metal's smooth, reflective surface.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, ranging from small spots to larger
            areas, with variation depending on tape application and removal methods.
          pattern: It typically forms irregular patches or streaks, often concentrated
            along edges or former tape boundaries, and may show remnants of tape backing
            or fibers.
        mineral:
          appearance: Adhesive residue shows as a glossy or matte coating, often translucent
            or lightly colored, that may cling to crystalline structures or smooth
            mineral faces.
          coverage: Coverage is generally minimal and uneven, varying with the mineral's
            surface properties and adhesive compatibility.
          pattern: It tends to form spotty patches or thin layers, influenced by the
            mineral's hardness and cleavage planes, with residue in crevices or along
            edges.
        plastic:
          appearance: Residue appears as a tacky, sometimes cloudy film that can be
            clear or tinted, often leaving a dull finish on the plastic's smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage is often widespread and consistent if tape covered large
            areas, but can be spotty with poor adhesion.
          pattern: It commonly forms uniform layers or irregular patches, with potential
            for streaking if tape was moved or removed unevenly.
        rubber:
          appearance: Residue appears as a gummy, often dark or discolored layer that
            can blend with or stand out on the rubber's matte or textured surface.
          coverage: Coverage varies from light smudges to heavy layers, with inconsistency
            due to rubber's elasticity and surface absorption.
          pattern: It usually forms smeared patches or streaks, sometimes embedding
            into the rubber's pores or flex lines, and may show tape residue patterns.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Residue appears as a faint, sticky film that is typically clear
            or slightly hazy, potentially interfering with the semiconductor's precise,
            smooth surface and optical properties.
          coverage: Coverage is typically controlled and minimal in clean environments,
            but can vary with application specificity and removal efficiency.
          pattern: It usually forms uniform thin layers or discrete spots, often aligned
            with masking tape patterns used in processing, and may include microscopic
            contaminants.
        specialty:
          appearance: Adhesive residue manifests variably based on the material's
            unique properties, often as a sticky film that may interact with coatings,
            textures, or functional layers.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from precise, minimal areas to broader sections,
            with high variation according to material-specific adhesion and intended
            use.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the specialty material's surface; it can
            form patches, streaks, or uniform layers, tailored to specific applications
            like electronics or aerospace.
        stone:
          appearance: Adhesive residue shows as a glossy or matte film, typically
            light-colored or translucent, that can appear smeared or embedded in the
            stone's porous surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse to moderate, with high variation
            based on stone porosity and tape contact area.
          pattern: It tends to form irregular patches or smears, often with visible
            tape outlines or residue concentrated in low spots or crevices.
        wood:
          appearance: Residue appears as a sticky, often discolored film that can
            be clear, brown, or yellowish, adhering to the wood grain and sometimes
            darkening it or trapping dust.
          coverage: Coverage varies from localized spots to broader areas, often inconsistent
            due to wood texture and adhesive penetration.
          pattern: It commonly forms patches or streaks following the wood grain,
            with uneven distribution due to the porous surface absorbing some adhesive.

    description: This algae-growth contamination, it manifests as a tenacious photosynthetic
      layer on outdoor surfaces, which thrives under light exposure to form vibrant
      green patinas that penetrate porous materials like stone and [Concrete](../materials/concrete.md).
      On metals, the organisms adhere resiliently, influenced from moisture cycles,
      exhibiting rapid regrowth unlike fungal biofilms or bacterial slimes that yield
      easily to abrasion. It seems that targeted biocides prove essential for clearance,
      given this persistence.

        appearance and properties.
    category: oxidation
    chemical_formula: Al₂O₃
    description: '[Aluminum](../materials/aluminum.md) oxidation contamination, it
      arises from air exposure. Oxygen reacts with metal surface, thus forms thin
      oxide layer rapidly. This process happens naturally in ambient conditions, and
      layer adheres strongly right away. Protective film develops compact, so limits
      further corrosion effectively.


      Unique characteristics distinguish this from rust on [Iron](../materials/iron.md).
      Aluminum oxide stays compact and self-limiting, unlike expansive rust that flakes
      and weakens material. Layer clings tenaciously, thus protects substrate durably.
      Non-degrading nature enhances integrity long-term, and sets it apart from loose
      contaminants.


      Behavior varies on different materials. On pure aluminum, oxide layer remains
      uniform and thin, still halting deeper attack. Alloys exhibit porous structure,
      so embeds particles deeply. Removal resists stubbornly in alloys, and composition
      influences adhesion this way. Pure forms show smoother protection, thus compared
      to alloy complexities.


      Key challenges stem from tight bond and quick reformation. Mechanical methods
      fail often, because oxide clings and scratches surface. Chemical treatments
      dissolve it temporarily, but air exposure causes regrowth immediately after.
      Persistence demands careful approaches, and aggressive techniques risk damaging
      metal underneath.


      Laser cleaning proves effective for this contamination. Precise energy delivery
      ablates oxide selectively, without affecting substrate. Heat vaporizes film
      rapidly, and surface exhibits cleanliness after treatment. Method avoids residues
      that promote reformation, thus balances efficiency with preservation. Suitability
      confirms for stubborn oxides.

    description: 'Laser cleaning lines up best for annealing-scale. It vaporizes the
      buildup precisely and keeps the base material intact. Turns out, acids drag
      on too slowly without etching underneath.


      Annealing-scale forms as a thick oxide layer during slow heating in controlled
      atmospheres. Heat treatments ramp it up deeper than simple surface rust.


      This scale clings tight and toughens the surface in unique ways. It alters conductivity
      far beyond lighter contaminants.


      On [steel](../materials/steel.md), it grips firm and shifts properties sharply.
      Stainless steel holds it even tighter. Titanium shows looser attachment overall.


      Mild acids work slowly for removal. Blasting scatters debris widely.


      Laser cleaning achieves a clean finish effectively.'

    valid_materials:
    - Aluminum
    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Ceramic surfaces do not display anodizing irregularities because
            anodizing is a metal-only process; the ceramic finish remains uniform
            and unaffected.
          coverage: Coverage is absent, with no variation, due to the incompatibility
            of anodizing with ceramic materials.
          pattern: No pattern is evident, as anodizing cannot be applied to ceramics.
        composite:
          appearance: Composite materials, unless metal-based, do not exhibit anodizing
            irregularities; any metal components might show issues, but non-metal
            parts remain unaffected.
          coverage: Coverage varies; it is non-existent for non-metal composites but
            can be partial and variable if metal elements are present.
          pattern: Pattern depends on composition; for non-metal composites, no pattern
            occurs, while metal parts may show irregular spots or streaks.
        concrete:
          appearance: Concrete does not exhibit anodizing irregularities, since anodizing
            is exclusive to metals; the concrete surface may have other imperfections
            but not from anodizing.
          coverage: Coverage is non-existent, with no variation, due to the material's
            incompatibility with anodizing.
          pattern: No pattern is formed, because anodizing is not applied to concrete.
        fabric:
          appearance: Fabric does not show anodizing layer irregularities, as anodizing
            is a metal treatment; the fabric's appearance is governed by its weave
            and dye, not anodizing.
          coverage: There is no coverage, as anodizing contamination cannot occur
            on fabric.
          pattern: No pattern is present, as anodizing processes are irrelevant to
            textile materials.
        glass:
          appearance: Glass does not exhibit anodizing layer irregularities, as anodizing
            is a treatment for metals; the glass surface shows no related visual changes.
          coverage: Coverage is zero, with no variation, as anodizing is irrelevant
            to glass.
          pattern: No pattern occurs, since anodizing is not applicable to glass.
        metal:
          appearance: Anodizing layer irregularities appear as uneven, blotchy areas
            with inconsistent color or sheen, often showing dull spots or discoloration
            against the metallic finish.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and variable, ranging from small localized
            areas to widespread patches, with significant variation across the surface.
          pattern: They typically manifest as random spots, streaks, or patches rather
            than a uniform distribution, with irregular shapes and sizes.
        mineral:
          appearance: Mineral surfaces do not display anodizing layer irregularities,
            as anodizing is a metal-specific process; minerals retain their natural
            colors and textures.
          coverage: Coverage is absent, with no variation, as anodizing is irrelevant
            to minerals.
          pattern: No pattern occurs, since anodizing cannot be performed on mineral
            materials.
        plastic:
          appearance: Plastic does not show anodizing layer irregularities, as anodizing
            is specific to metals; the plastic surface may have other defects but
            not from anodizing.
          coverage: There is no coverage, as anodizing contamination is not possible
            on plastic.
          pattern: No pattern is formed, because anodizing processes do not involve
            plastics.
        rubber:
          appearance: Rubber surfaces do not display anodizing irregularities, as
            anodizing is not applicable; the rubber may have inherent textures but
            no anodizing-related defects.
          coverage: Coverage is zero, with no variation, because anodizing does not
            affect rubber.
          pattern: No pattern is observed, since anodizing cannot be performed on
            rubber.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Semiconductors, often silicon-based, do not typically show anodizing
            irregularities as anodizing is for metals; any metal layers might exhibit
            issues, but the semiconductor itself is unaffected.
          coverage: Coverage is variable; it can be partial on metal elements but
            non-existent on the semiconductor material itself.
          pattern: Pattern may appear as irregular spots or streaks on metal components,
            but no pattern on non-metal semiconductor parts.
        specialty:
          appearance: For specialty materials, anodizing irregularities only appear
            if metal-based; otherwise, no visual changes occur, and the surface remains
            as per its unique properties.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely; it is non-existent for non-metal specialties
            but can be partial and inconsistent for metal-inclusive ones.
          pattern: Pattern depends on composition; metal specialties may show irregular
            distributions, while non-metal ones have no pattern.
        stone:
          appearance: Anodizing irregularities do not appear on stone, as anodizing
            is exclusive to metals; the stone surface remains unaffected by such processes.
          coverage: There is no coverage, as anodizing contamination does not apply
            to stone.
          pattern: No pattern is present because anodizing is not performed on stone
            materials.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, anodizing irregularities are not applicable as anodizing
            is a metal-specific process; thus, no such contamination appears.
          coverage: Coverage is non-existent as anodizing is irrelevant to wood surfaces.
          pattern: No pattern is observed since anodizing cannot occur on wood materials.

  anti-seize:
    composition:
    - Copper
    - Graphite
    - Aluminum
    - Grease
    description: During assembly, anti-seize contamination forms as sticky metallic
      and graphite-based deposits so tenacious adhesion builds up over time from heat
      and friction on surfaces. This contamination exhibits heat-resistant properties
      and strong bonding on steel, stainless steel, and aluminum, which distinguishes
      it from rust or oils because mechanical removal damages substrates during process.
      Key challenges occur in removal due to that bonding, so laser cleaning ablates
      layers precisely and base materials remain unharmed after treatment.

            like chrysotile, often in shades of white, green, or gray.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely from sparse veins to dense deposits, influenced
            by the mineral's natural occurrence and mining.
          pattern: It forms in veins, clusters, or layered patterns within host rocks,
            depending on geological formation.
        plastic:
          appearance: Asbestos may be mixed as white or gray fibers into plastic composites,
            resulting in a speckled or fibrous look.
          coverage: Coverage is typically even and complete within the material, though
            it can degrade over time, leading to variations.
          pattern: It is generally uniformly dispersed throughout the plastic matrix
            in products like vinyl tiles or electrical components.
        rubber:
          appearance: Asbestos is incorporated as gray or white fibers in rubber products,
            giving a slightly textured, matte finish.
          coverage: Coverage is usually even and extensive within the material, intended
            for heat or wear resistance.
          pattern: It is typically uniformly mixed into the rubber matrix, such as
            in gaskets or flooring, but may show as fine streaks.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Asbestos is extremely rare in semiconductors but might appear
            as contaminant fibers on surfaces, looking like fine, white dust.
          coverage: Coverage is minimal and accidental, limited to trace amounts on
            equipment or in older insulation nearby.
          pattern: It would form sporadic spots or layers, usually from external sources
            during manufacturing or handling.
        specialty:
          appearance: Asbestos in specialty materials varies but often appears as
            fibrous, off-white inclusions in items like filters or insulation.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from partial to full, tailored to the product's
            purpose, with variations based on use and degradation.
          pattern: It is typically designed for uniform distribution but may show
            patches or streaks in custom applications.
        stone:
          appearance: Asbestos contamination in stone is rare but can appear as fibrous,
            light-colored veins or inclusions in certain natural stones or composites.
          coverage: Coverage is typically low and uneven, limited to specific mineral
            veins or manufactured stone products.
          pattern: It may form sporadic streaks or patches, often mixed with the stone
            matrix in products like asbestos-cement sheets.
        wood:
          appearance: Asbestos may be present as a fibrous, off-white or gray material
            in wood composites or as insulation attached to wooden structures.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and localized, such as in specific
            insulation areas, with variations due to wear or damage.
          pattern: It often appears in streaks or patches, especially in older wood-based
            products like siding or insulation boards.

    description: 'Aviation sealant contamination grips surfaces with a tenacious,
      rubbery hold. Engineers encounter it often in aircraft assembly. Polysulfide
      and silicone sealants seal joints effectively, but excess material or uneven
      application leads to this issue. Workers apply these sealants to prevent leaks,
      yet improper curing or overspray creates persistent residues that harden over
      time.


      This contamination sets itself apart from oils or paints through its elastic
      texture once cured. Unlike greasy films that wipe away easily, it forms a crosslinked
      polymer layer resistant to basic solvents. Turns out, that durability stems
      from chemical bonds that lock in place, making it tougher to shift than adhesive
      tapes or metal shavings.


      On [Aluminum](../materials/aluminum.md), the sealant bonds deeply into the oxide
      layer, often embedding during heat exposure. It creeps into microscopic pores,
      complicating clean-up without scratching the metal. [Titanium](../materials/titanium.md)
      shows similar behavior; the contamination adheres stubbornly to its passive
      surface, resisting peel-off and potentially altering fatigue properties if left
      unchecked. For [Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer](../materials/carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer.md),
      residues infiltrate the resin matrix, creating stress points that weaken composite
      integrity over flights. Fiberglass reacts in kind, with sealant seeping between
      strands and hardening into a brittle interface that pulls fibers loose during
      removal attempts.


      Removal poses solid challenges overall. Traditional scraping risks substrate
      damage, while chemical strippers fail to penetrate the cured barrier fully.
      In practice, these methods drag out downtime and demand hazardous waste handling,
      ramping up costs without reliable results.


      Laser cleaning addresses this head-on by delivering targeted energy pulses.
      It vaporizes the sealant layer precisely, layer by layer, without abrading the
      base material. The process works out well for delicate surfaces, cutting down
      on residue remnants and preserving tight tolerances. Data from field tests confirms
      it clears contamination effectively, maintaining structural soundness across
      aluminum, titanium, carbon fiber reinforced polymer, and fiberglass.'

            clean and others covered in thin to moderate layers, depending on surface
            smoothness and sealant viscosity.
          pattern: Distribution is often spotty or streaky, with residues clustering
            around joints, glazed areas, or imperfections where sealant adhered more
            strongly.
        composite:
          appearance: Aerospace sealant residue on composites shows as a film or deposits
            in shades of gray, white, or amber, with a rubbery or crusty texture that
            can embed into fibrous layers, altering the surface sheen.
          coverage: Coverage is generally uneven, ranging from thin veils to thick
            accumulations, with variations influenced by the composite's porosity
            and the sealant's application method.
          pattern: It typically appears as streaks, blotches, or uniform layers, often
            following the composite's weave or laminate structure and concentrating
            at bond lines or fasteners.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, the residue manifests as a film or crust in gray,
            white, or yellowish shades, with a rough, rubbery texture that can fill
            pores and create a slightly shiny or dull finish.
          coverage: Coverage is typically low and uneven, with thin films in some
            areas and thicker deposits in others, influenced by concrete's porosity
            and exposure conditions.

            rough surfaces, cracks, or joints where sealant was used for sealing or
            adhering purposes.
        fabric:
          appearance: Residue on fabric appears as stiffened, discolored areas in
            white, gray, or brown tones, with a crusty or tacky texture that can mat
            fibers and reduce flexibility.
          coverage: Coverage is usually sparse and irregular, with some fibers lightly
            coated and others heavily saturated, leading to a mottled effect based
            on fabric absorbency.
          pattern: It typically forms spots, streaks, or diffuse patches, often following
            the fabric weave or concentrating at edges, seams, or where sealant was
            accidentally applied.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, aerospace sealant residue is visible as a hazy, translucent
            to opaque smear or film, often in white, gray, or yellowish hues, with
            a smooth or slightly tacky feel that can obscure clarity.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from thin, widespread films to concentrated patches,
            often varying based on application precision and cleaning efforts, with
            edges frequently showing more residue.
          pattern: It typically appears as streaks, smudges, or uniform layers, especially
            along edges, seals, or where overspray occurred, sometimes forming web-like
            patterns if stretched.
        metal:
          appearance: Aerospace sealant residue on metal often appears as a translucent
            to opaque film, ranging from white to gray or amber, with a rubbery or
            tacky texture that can attract dust.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and uneven, varying from thin films
            in some areas to thicker accumulations in others, depending on application
            and removal methods.
          pattern: It typically forms irregular streaks or patches, often concentrated
            around seams, joints, or fastener holes where sealant was applied.
        mineral:
          appearance: Residue on mineral surfaces shows as a coating or spots that
            can be translucent to opaque in white, gray, or earth tones, with a smooth
            or gritty texture depending on the mineral's hardness and sealant consistency.
          coverage: Coverage is generally minimal and variable, ranging from faint
            smears to localized thick layers, based on the mineral's surface properties
            and sealant interaction.
          pattern: Distribution is often spotty or streaky, with residues adhering
            to crystalline structures, fissures, or polished areas where sealant was
            applied or spilled.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, the residue appears as a film or blobs that can
            be transparent, white, or tinted, with a soft, tacky texture that may
            cause slight discoloration or a greasy look.
          coverage: Coverage varies from light, scattered films to dense patches,
            with uneven distribution due to plastic's low surface energy affecting
            adhesion and spread.
          pattern: It often forms irregular spots, streaks, or uniform coatings, particularly
            along seams, molded edges, or areas exposed to sealant during assembly
            or repair.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, the residue blends or contrasts as a sticky, glossy
            layer in colors like black, gray, or clear, feeling gummy and potentially
            causing swelling or softening of the rubber substrate.
          coverage: Coverage can be extensive and variable, from light coatings to
            heavy buildups, depending on compatibility and whether the sealant was
            intended to integrate with the rubber.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or uniform, with residues spreading
            along seams, flex points, or entire surfaces if sealant was applied for
            bonding or sealing purposes.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, aerospace sealant residue appears as a thin,
            often clear or lightly colored film, with a smooth, possibly conductive
            or insulating texture that can interfere with electronic properties.
          coverage: Coverage is usually controlled and even but can vary from sparse
            contaminants to complete coatings, depending on application precision
            and cleaning protocols in sensitive environments.
          pattern: It typically forms uniform layers or microscopic spots, often concentrated
            on edges, bonding pads, or exposed surfaces during assembly or encapsulation
            processes.
        specialty:
          appearance: Residue on specialty materials (e.g., advanced alloys or coatings)
            appears as a film or deposits in colors matching the sealant, with textures
            ranging from rubbery to brittle, potentially altering specialized surface
            finishes.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, from minimal, targeted applications
            to extensive coatings, designed to meet specific functional requirements
            while minimizing excess residue.
          pattern: Distribution is often tailored to the material's use, showing as
            uniform layers, precise patterns, or random spots based on application
            methods like spraying or brushing in high-performance contexts.
        stone:
          appearance: Residue on stone surfaces appears as a film or spots that can
            be clear, white, or discolored, with a slightly raised, rubbery texture
            that contrasts with the stone's natural roughness.
          coverage: Coverage is generally low and uneven, with some areas showing
            minimal residue and others having thicker buildups, influenced by the
            stone's porosity and surface treatment.
          pattern: It commonly forms isolated patches or streaks, often clinging to
            porous areas, cracks, or edges where sealant was applied or dripped during
            use.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, the residue may present as a sticky, glossy or matte
            layer in shades of beige, brown, or gray, potentially darkening the wood
            grain and feeling gummy to the touch.
          coverage: Coverage tends to be sparse and localized, with variations from
            light smears to dense spots, especially in porous areas that absorb more
            sealant.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the wood's grain
            or accumulating in crevices and knots where sealant seeped or was not
            fully removed.

      electrical stress. Unlike atmospheric rust on steels, battery type resists oxidation
      reversal and clings to alloys tightly. On metals like [Copper](../materials/copper.md),
      it builds insulating films; on polymers, it induces cracking. Challenges in
      removal follow, thus demands careful dissolution methods.

    name: Beryllium Oxide Contamination
    prohibited_materials: []
    valid_materials:
    - Copper-Beryllium Alloy
    - Steel
    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide on ceramic surfaces manifests as a dull, white
            to off-white powdery residue that may contrast with the glaze, potentially
            causing a chalky or frosted appearance.
          coverage: Coverage is often localized and sparse, varying with ceramic porosity
            and handling, rarely achieving full surface coverage.
          pattern: Distribution is typically irregular, with spots or patches that
            cluster in unglazed areas, seams, or surface imperfections, rather than
            covering the entire object uniformly.
        composite:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide contamination on composites shows as a pale,
            powdery coating that may highlight the material's layered or fibrous structure,
            appearing whitish or gray on the surface.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and variable, depending on the composite's
            composition and exposure, with uneven spread across the surface.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the composite's
            texture and accumulating in gaps or rough areas, rather than forming a
            consistent layer.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, contamination appears as a light gray or whitish
            powdery layer that can blend with or lighten the natural color, often
            giving a chalky or efflorescent look.
          coverage: Coverage is partial and variable, ranging from small spots to
            larger sections, influenced by concrete porosity and exposure factors.
          pattern: It typically forms in irregular patches or blotches, concentrated
            in porous areas, cracks, or surface irregularities, with less uniformity
            on smooth finishes.
        fabric:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide on fabric surfaces looks like a fine, white
            to gray powdery residue that can cling to fibers, potentially giving a
            dusty or stained appearance to the material.
          coverage: Coverage tends to be low and uneven, with patches that vary in
            intensity, and it may not fully cover the fabric due to its absorbent
            nature.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the weave pattern
            and accumulating in folds or low spots, rather than being uniform across
            the fabric.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, beryllium oxide contamination is visible as a faint,
            hazy or milky film that can reduce transparency, appearing as a light
            gray or white deposit on the surface.
          coverage: Coverage can vary from light, partial films to more extensive
            layers, but it is usually not complete and may show inconsistencies in
            thickness.
          pattern: It often distributes in a streaky or smeared pattern, sometimes
            forming fine spots or a thin uniform layer, especially if applied or settled
            from airborne particles.
        metal:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide contamination on metal often appears as a fine,
            white to grayish powdery or crystalline deposit, sometimes with a dull
            or matte finish that contrasts with the metal's natural luster.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and localized, varying from sparse
            patches to more extensive areas depending on exposure conditions and surface
            texture.
          pattern: It typically forms in irregular spots or streaks, often concentrated
            in crevices, joints, or areas with surface imperfections, rather than
            uniformly across the surface.
        mineral:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide contamination on minerals presents as a pale,
            powdery or crystalline coating that may obscure natural colors and luster,
            appearing white to gray on the surface.
          coverage: Coverage is typically localized and uneven, with variations based
            on mineral type and exposure, seldom covering the entire specimen.
          pattern: Distribution is often spotty or patchy, following crystal faces
            or fractures, and may cluster in recessed areas rather than covering the
            mineral uniformly.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, contamination appears as a light gray or white dusty
            film that can make the surface look cloudy or dull, adhering less firmly
            than on porous materials.
          coverage: Coverage is generally low to moderate, with patches that vary
            in size and density, seldom covering the entire surface uniformly.
          pattern: It tends to form in streaks or random spots, often influenced by
            static electricity or surface smoothness, and may not distribute evenly
            across the plastic.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, contamination appears as a light-colored, dusty or
            chalky deposit that can embed in the flexible surface, sometimes causing
            a slight discoloration or reduced gloss.
          coverage: Coverage is usually sparse and localized, with variations based
            on rubber type and environmental conditions, rarely covering large areas
            completely.
          pattern: It commonly forms in irregular spots or smears, often concentrated
            in creases or textured areas, and may not spread uniformly due to rubber's
            non-porous nature.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, beryllium oxide contamination appears as
            a subtle, light-colored film or particulate deposit that can cause hazing
            or minor discoloration on the precise surfaces.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and patchy, with high variation depending
            on processing conditions, and is often limited to specific areas to avoid
            performance issues.
          pattern: It often distributes in fine spots or a thin, uneven layer, potentially
            concentrated at edges or defects, and may not be uniformly spread due
            to controlled environments.
        specialty:
          appearance: Beryllium oxide contamination on specialty materials (e.g.,
            advanced alloys or coatings) appears as a faint, whitish to gray deposit
            that may alter surface properties, depending on the material's unique
            characteristics.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and inconsistent, designed or occurring
            in specific zones, with amounts varying based on the material's use and
            exposure.
          pattern: Distribution is highly variable, often forming in irregular patterns
            like spots or streaks tailored to the material's structure, and rarely
            uniform due to specialized applications.
        stone:
          appearance: Contamination on stone surfaces appears as a pale, whitish to
            gray powdery coating that may adhere to rough textures, sometimes giving
            a faded or discolored look to the natural stone color.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and uneven, ranging from small,
            isolated spots to larger areas, influenced by the stone's porosity and
            exposure duration.
          pattern: It commonly forms in irregular patches or blotches, often concentrated
            in porous regions or surface depressions, with less adherence on smooth,
            polished areas.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, beryllium oxide contamination may present as a light-colored,
            dusty or chalky residue that can cling to the porous surface, potentially
            altering its natural grain and color.
          coverage: Coverage tends to be low to moderate, with significant variation
            based on wood porosity and environmental factors, rarely covering the
            entire surface uniformly.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the wood's grain
            or accumulating in cracks and low-lying areas, rather than forming a uniform
            layer.

            effects.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, these coatings show as dark, often rough or glossy
            layers that penetrate pores, creating a mottled or sealed look against
            the gray surface.
          coverage: Coverage can range from light spotting to heavy, full coats, with
            unevenness due to surface absorption and environmental exposure.
          pattern: Distribution includes patches, drips, or uniform coatings in some
            cases, influenced by concrete's porosity and application methods like
            spraying or brushing.
        fabric:
          appearance: Bitumen and tar on fabric appear as dark, stained areas that
            are sticky or stiff, altering the texture and color, sometimes leading
            to hardening or brittleness.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and irregular, ranging from small
            spots to large saturated areas, with variations in penetration and thickness.
          pattern: They form blotches, streaks, or soaked patches, following the weave
            of the fabric and spreading along fibers or seams.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, these coatings show as dark, translucent to opaque
            films that are sticky or brittle, often obscuring transparency and reflecting
            light unevenly.
          coverage: Coverage tends to be sparse to moderate, with variations from
            thin veils to thick blobs, often concentrated at edges or lower sections.
          pattern: Distribution is commonly in streaks, drips, or splatters, with
            patterns shaped by application or environmental factors like rain or wind.
        metal:
          appearance: Bitumen and tar coatings on metal appear as dark brown to black,
            glossy or matte layers with a sticky, viscous texture that can harden
            over time.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial to full, varying from thin films
            to thick accumulations, with uneven distribution due to surface irregularities
            or weathering.
          pattern: They often form irregular patches, streaks, or drips, influenced
            by application methods or environmental runoff, rather than uniform coverage.
        mineral:
          appearance: Bitumen and tar on minerals appear as dark, adherent films that
            contrast with natural colors and crystalline structures, often glossy
            or matte depending on age.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and variable, from thin films to
            thick encrustations, with uneven distribution based on mineral porosity
            and geometry.
          pattern: They form irregular coatings, drips, or infiltrations, following
            mineral fractures or surfaces, leading to speckled or veined patterns.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, these coatings manifest as dark, often glossy films
            that may be sticky or hardened, potentially causing discoloration or adhesion
            issues on the smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light to moderate, with uneven amounts;
            thin layers may form, but thick accumulations are rare unless trapped
            in textures.
          pattern: Distribution includes streaks, patches, or drips, shaped by the
            plastic's low absorption, resulting in beading or spreading patterns.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, these coatings present as dark, elastic or hardened
            layers that may blend with or stand out from the rubber's surface, often
            appearing glossy or matte.
          coverage: Coverage varies from light films to thick coats, with unevenness
            due to stretching or compression, often concentrating in indentations.
          pattern: Distribution is typically in smears, patches, or drips, influenced
            by rubber's flexibility and surface texture, causing wavy or cracked patterns.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, these coatings manifest as dark, contaminating
            layers that can be sticky or hardened, potentially interfering with electronic
            properties and appearing as foreign deposits.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and localized, with sparse amounts
            that vary by incident, often concentrated on exposed surfaces or edges.
          pattern: Distribution is often in spots, smears, or thin films, influenced
            by handling or environmental factors, rather than intentional application.
        specialty:
          appearance: Bitumen and tar on specialty materials appear as dark, adaptable
            coatings whose look depends on the base material, often sticky or brittle
            and altering original aesthetics.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely, from light contamination to heavy layers,
            with unevenness due to specialized surface characteristics and application
            contexts.
          pattern: They form irregular distributions like patches or streaks, shaped
            by the material's unique properties, such as conductivity or flexibility.
        stone:
          appearance: Bitumen and tar on stone appear as dark, often glossy coatings
            that can be sticky or hardened, contrasting with the natural color and
            texture of the stone surface.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and uneven, with thick accumulations
            in crevices and thinner areas on smooth surfaces, varying with exposure
            conditions.
          pattern: They typically form irregular patches, drips, or smears, influenced
            by gravity and surface porosity, rather than uniform application.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, these coatings present as dark, opaque layers ranging
            from brown to black, with a rough or smooth finish that may penetrate
            the grain, creating a stained look.
          coverage: Coverage varies from light spotting to heavy, uneven coats, with
            areas of high absorption leading to inconsistent thickness and potential
            peeling.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the wood's natural
            grain or forming drips and splatters from application or spills.

      occurs quickly and sticky layers form. Oxidation and coagulation bind these
      layers, so they harden over time. Residue embeds into microstructures thus,
      and formation happens rapidly after exposure.


      Unique characteristics distinguish blood-residue from inorganic contaminants.
      Reddish-brown staining appears, and organic composition confirms biological
      origin. This residue shows fluorescence under certain lights, so it differs
      from dust or oils. Simple wiping fails against it, unlike water-based stains
      that evaporate easily. Analysis reveals differences from mineral deposits, thus
      establishing distinct nature.


      Behavior on materials varies with surface properties. On stainless steel, residue
      adheres firmly and causes slight corrosion over time. Crown glass and float
      glass suffer cracking from residue penetration, while borosilicate glass resists
      deeper bonding. Fused silica and Gorilla glass display minimal absorption, yet
      residue persists in pores. Alumina and silicon carbide trap residue in rough
      textures, and zirconia maintains smoothness despite surface films. Tempered
      glass develops haze thus altering transparency. Aluminosilicate glass shows
      similar persistence, and silicon nitride exhibits strong adhesion in crevices.


      Key challenges emerge in removal efforts. Residue tenacity demands aggressive
      methods, yet these risk substrate damage. Solvents often fail to dissolve bonds,
      and mechanical scrubbing scratches surfaces so. Contamination lingers in crevices
      thus requiring repeated applications. Complete elimination proves difficult,
      and persistence frustrates cleaning processes.


      Laser cleaning addresses these issues effectively. Pulses target organic bonds
      precisely, and ablation vaporizes residues without heat spread. After treatment,
      surfaces exhibit cleanliness so material integrity remains preserved. This method
      avoids chemical residues thus ensuring thorough removal.

        ceramic:
          appearance: Dark gray dust that adheres to smooth, glazed surfaces, appearing
            as a dull film over the ceramic's usual luster.
          coverage: Light to moderate, with even spread on horizontal surfaces but
            less on vertical ones, and removable with washing.
          pattern: Distributes as fine spots or a uniform layer, influenced by surface
            orientation and cleaning frequency.
        composite:
          appearance: Dark dust that settles on composite materials, blending with

  brass-plating:
    composition:
    - Cu-Zn Alloy
    - Brass
    description: Brass-plating contamination forms during alloy deposition for decorative
      layering on hardware. Impurities embed in the process, and create uneven films
      thus leading to flaky residues. This contamination, it distinguishes from uniform
      oxides through metallic sheen and strong adhesion that resists simple wiping.
      On zinc alloy, it spreads rapidly and bonds tightly so persists under exposure,
      while on steel, it flakes loosely after time passes. Removal challenges arise
      from persistent sticking, and mechanical scraping damages surfaces easily. Laser
      cleaning proves effective, as pulses vaporize layers precisely thus restore
      smoothness without harm.

  bronze-patina:
    composition:

    - Copper Salts
    description: Bronze-patina contamination, it arises from oxidation of copper-tin
      alloys in bronze when exposed to moist air and pollutants, thus forming adherent
      green-brown layers that alter surface appearance. This patina shows earthy color
      and porous texture, it distinguishes from similar contaminants by adhering tightly
      on bronze while spreading unevenly on brass surfaces and thinly on copper, so
      chemical bonding resists mechanical scraping and poses key removal challenges.
      Laser cleaning applies precise energy pulses to ablate the layer selectively,
      thus restoring underlying metal without heat damage, and surface already exhibits
      integrity after treatment.

    description: Carbon-soot contamination, it forms from incomplete combustion in
      engines and furnaces. Black residue appears as fine particulates that cling
      tightly. This soot differs from dust, it resists water and embeds deeply, thus
      not brushing off easily. On steel and concrete, it alters surface texture and
      penetrates pores. Removal challenges include scratching risks and chemical residues
      that linger. Laser cleaning works effectively, it vaporizes soot precisely and
      preserves substrate integrity thus.

            film that reduces clarity, creating a smoky, hazy appearance with a fine,
            powdery texture when touched.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light to moderate, with variations such
            as thicker layers in corners or near vents, and can be easily disturbed
            or wiped away.
          pattern: It typically forms in streaks or smudges, often following airflow
            paths or condensation lines, and may appear more uniform on flat surfaces
            but patchy on edges.
        metal:
          appearance: Carbon soot appears as a dark gray to black, powdery or smudgy
            layer that can obscure the metallic luster and create a matte, dull finish.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial to heavy, varying from light dusting
            in open areas to thick deposits in sheltered spots or near combustion
            sources.
          pattern: It often forms in streaks or patches, especially around edges,
            joints, or areas with airflow, and may accumulate unevenly due to surface
            irregularities.
        mineral:
          appearance: Carbon soot on minerals appears as a dark, sooty coating that
            can obscure natural colors and crystal faces, giving a dull, blackened
            finish with a fine, powdery texture.
          coverage: Coverage is typically uneven, ranging from sparse to dense, with
            heavier deposits in protected niches or near sources, and lighter on exposed,
            smooth surfaces.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, with accumulation in fissures,
            cleavage planes, or sheltered areas, and patterns may reflect mineral
            structure and exposure history.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, carbon soot looks like a dark, smudgy film that
            can cling to smooth surfaces, causing a loss of shine and a matte, dirty
            appearance with possible electrostatic attraction.
          coverage: Coverage is usually light to moderate, varying from a thin layer
            on exposed parts to thicker deposits in corners or sheltered spots, and
            can be easily smeared.
          pattern: Distribution is often uniform or streaky, with patches forming
            on static-prone areas or near airflow, and may be influenced by surface
            charge and plastic type.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, carbon soot deposits as a dark, black film that can
            embed into the flexible surface, leading to a grimy, stained appearance
            with a slightly tacky or powdery feel.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial to heavy, with variations such as
            thick layers in static areas or light dusting on exposed surfaces, influenced
            by rubber composition.
          pattern: It commonly forms in patches or streaks, accumulating in grooves,
            seams, or areas with less movement, and may show patterns from handling
            or environmental exposure.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, carbon soot appears as a dark, particulate
            film that can interfere with surface properties, creating a smoky, contaminated
            look with potential for micro-scale texture changes.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light and variable, from minimal dusting
            to localized patches, with critical implications for performance in clean
            or controlled settings.
          pattern: It often deposits uniformly or in fine spots, influenced by electrostatic
            effects or processing environments, and may concentrate on edges or sensitive
            areas.
        specialty:
          appearance: Carbon soot on specialty materials appears as a dark, sooty
            layer that adapts to unique surfaces, such as coatings or advanced polymers,
            resulting in a customized dirty appearance with texture variations.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, from sparse to extensive, tailored
            to the material's use case, with potential for heavy accumulation in specialized
            applications or harsh conditions.
          pattern: Distribution depends on material properties, often showing patches,
            streaks, or uniform layers influenced by specific design, exposure, and
            environmental factors.
        stone:
          appearance: Carbon soot deposits on stone appear as a dark, charcoal-like
            coating that can mask natural colors and textures, giving a dirty, stained
            look with a slightly abrasive feel.
          coverage: Coverage varies from sparse to extensive, with heavier deposits
            in protected niches or near pollution sources, and lighter coverage on
            smooth, exposed surfaces.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, concentrating in crevices,
            rough areas, or sheltered parts, and may form patterns influenced by surface
            porosity and environmental exposure.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, carbon soot looks like a dark, sooty film that can
            penetrate porous grains, resulting in a grimy, blackened surface that
            may feel gritty.
          coverage: Coverage is usually uneven, ranging from light spotting to dense
            layers, especially in corners or near heat sources, with variations based
            on wood texture.
          pattern: It tends to settle in patches or along grain lines, with higher
            accumulation in recessed areas and less on exposed surfaces, often showing
            directional streaks from air currents.

      particles dislodge and bond with exhaust gases, influenced from prolonged exposure
      to combustion byproducts. The process yields a tenacious film that persists
      on surfaces, that demonstrates strong embedding.


      What distinguishes this contamination appears its layered structure, unlike
      soot deposits that flake easily or oil residues that dissolve in solvents. These
      ceramic fragments exhibit crystalline edges, which lead to irregular adhesion
      patterns, manifesting as patchy, iridescent coatings rather than uniform films.


      On [Steel](../materials/steel.md), the contamination adheres strongly, exploiting
      the material''s porosity, which results in deep embedding that resists mechanical
      scraping. [Stainless Steel](../materials/stainless-steel.md) shows moderate
      bonding, where the oxide layer underneath enhances persistence, yet allows slight
      delamination under thermal stress. Titanium surfaces demonstrate weaker attachment,
      as the contamination tends to crack along grain boundaries, influenced from
      the metal''s lower reactivity.


      Removal challenges arise from the contamination''s tenacity, which demands methods
      avoiding substrate damage, particularly on heat-sensitive steels. Abrasive techniques
      risk pitting, while chemical agents prove ineffective against the inert ceramic
      bonds, that demonstrate prolonged exposure without dissolution.


      Laser cleaning proves effective here, as the pulsed energy selectively ablates
      the layer through vaporization, without altering the underlying material integrity.
      This approach targets the contamination''s optical absorption, leading to clean
      restoration that exhibits smoothness on steel, stainless steel, and titanium.'

            rubber composition.
          pattern: Commonly forms in blotches or streaks, especially along seams or
            in flexed areas, and may spread unevenly due to rubber's elasticity and
            porosity.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Manifests as a subtle, often invisible or faint hazy coating
            under magnification that can interfere with electronic properties, appearing
            as micro-scale contaminants.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and highly controlled, but can vary
            from sparse particles to thin layers, with critical impacts on performance
            in localized regions.
          pattern: Typically forms in uniform or speckled patterns at microscopic
            levels, often concentrated on active areas or edges, and may be uneven
            due to processing.
        specialty:
          appearance: Varies widely but often appears as a discolored, powdery, or
            filmy layer that alters the material's intended finish, feeling irregular
            based on composition.
          coverage: Coverage is unpredictable and uneven, with amounts ranging from
            light films to heavy deposits, showing great variation due to the specialized
            nature of these materials.
          pattern: Distribution is highly material-dependent, ranging from uniform
            coatings to irregular patches, influenced by unique properties like reactivity
            or surface treatment.
        stone:
          appearance: Shows up as a pale, often white or off-white, powdery residue
            that can give the stone a frosted look and a rough, sandy texture.
          coverage: Coverage is typically patchy and incomplete, with dense accumulation
            in textured areas and minimal coverage on smooth surfaces, leading to
            high variability.
          pattern: Tends to form in irregular spots or patches, frequently in crevices,
            pores, or on rough surfaces where contaminants can adhere more easily.
        wood:
          appearance: Manifests as a dull, whitish or grayish coating that can make
            the wood look faded and feel gritty, often hiding the natural grain and
            texture.
          coverage: Coverage is generally uneven and sparse, with heavier buildup
            in recessed areas and lighter coverage on exposed surfaces, varying with
            wood type and conditions.
          pattern: Commonly appears in blotchy patches or streaks, following the wood
            grain or accumulating in cracks and pores due to absorption and environmental

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: As the intended surface, ceramic glaze appears as a vitrified,
            glossy coating that bonds seamlessly, displaying consistent colors and
            a smooth, hard texture.
          coverage: Coverage is usually complete and even, forming a continuous protective
            layer across the ceramic body after firing.
          pattern: It is typically applied in uniform layers or decorative designs,
            resulting in even distribution without random spotting when properly fired.
        composite:
          appearance: On composites, ceramic glaze deposits appear as a heterogeneous
            layer that may not integrate well, showing glossy areas mixed with the
            composite's texture and colors.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and inconsistent, varying from light
            coatings to thicker accumulations in porous or rough regions.
          pattern: They distribute in random patches or streaks, influenced by the
            composite's varied material components and surface properties.
        concrete:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze on concrete surfaces looks like a hard, glossy
            film that may fill pores, displaying colors that stand out against the
            rough, gray background of concrete.
          coverage: Coverage is partial and variable, ranging from light coatings
            in high spots to thicker layers in recessed areas, depending on application.
          pattern: Deposits often form in irregular patches or drips, influenced by
            concrete's porosity and surface texture, rather than being uniform.
        fabric:
          appearance: On fabric, ceramic glaze deposits appear as stiff, crusty areas
            that can be colorful but brittle, altering the fabric's soft texture and
            potentially causing discoloration.
          coverage: Coverage is sparse and patchy, often minimal due to fabric absorption,
            with high variation and potential for flaking during use.
          pattern: They typically show as random spots or streaks, following the weave
            pattern and not forming a continuous layer.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, ceramic glaze deposits appear as fused, translucent
            or opaque layers that can create a frosted or colored effect, often with
            a smooth, glossy finish.
          coverage: Coverage can range from thin, even films to thicker, localized
            areas, with high variation based on intent and application technique.
          pattern: They usually distribute in uniform coats or deliberate patterns
            if applied artistically, but accidental contamination may show as streaks
            or spots.
        metal:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze deposits on metal appear as glossy, often colorful
            coatings that can range from smooth to slightly textured, depending on
            the glaze composition and application.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, varying from small spots to larger
            areas, with uneven distribution due to adhesion differences on metal surfaces.
          pattern: They typically form in irregular patches or streaks, often concentrated
            in areas where glaze was applied or dripped, rather than uniformly distributed.
        mineral:
          appearance: On minerals, ceramic glaze deposits appear as a fused, glassy
            coating that can enhance or mask natural colors and crystal structures,
            feeling smooth and hard.
          coverage: Coverage is typically uneven and partial, with spots of dense
            glaze interspersed with bare areas, influenced by mineral composition.
          pattern: They distribute in blotchy areas or follow mineral cleavage planes,
            not covering the surface evenly due to varying absorption.
        plastic:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze on plastic looks like a brittle, often cracked
            film that may not adhere well, showing glossy colors that contrast with
            the plastic's smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage is minimal and uneven, often limited to surface contact
            points, with high variation and potential for flaking off.
          pattern: Deposits form in irregular spots or peeling patches, as glaze does
            not fuse with plastic, leading to poor distribution.
        rubber:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze on rubber surfaces looks like a non-adherent,
            flaky coating that can appear glossy but often cracks due to rubber's
            flexibility, contrasting with its matte finish.
          coverage: Coverage is very low and uneven, usually limited to superficial
            contact, with significant variation and easy detachment.
          pattern: It forms in isolated spots or smears, as glaze does not bond well,
            resulting in erratic distribution without uniformity.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze on semiconductors looks like an unwanted, insulating
            layer that may be glossy or matte, potentially interfering with electronic
            properties and appearing as a foreign coating.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and highly variable, considered a
            defect with sparse, isolated deposits that can affect performance.
          pattern: It forms in random contaminants such as spots or thin films, often
            from processing errors, without intentional distribution patterns.
        specialty:
          appearance: On specialty materials like advanced alloys or polymers, ceramic
            glaze deposits appear as incongruous, often brittle coatings that may
            not integrate, showing glossy finishes against the base material's unique
            properties.
          coverage: Coverage is partial and inconsistent, varying widely with material
            type, often minimal and considered contamination rather than functional.
          pattern: Distribution is erratic, forming in patches or streaks based on
            surface compatibility, without uniformity due to material-specific reactions.
        stone:
          appearance: Ceramic glaze on stone surfaces presents as a glassy, often
            vibrant film that can enhance or obscure the stone's natural color and
            texture, feeling smooth to the touch.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and variable, ranging from light
            speckling to dense areas, depending on application methods and stone type.
          pattern: It tends to form in blotchy patches or streaks, influenced by the
            stone's roughness and absorption, rather than covering it evenly.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, ceramic glaze deposits look like shiny, hardened layers
            that may crack or peel, with colors contrasting against the natural grain
            and texture of the wood.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and uneven, limited by wood's porosity,
            resulting in isolated areas with minimal to moderate glaze accumulation.
          pattern: Deposits often appear as random patches or drips, following the
            wood's surface irregularities and not forming a uniform layer.

          appearance: Dust blends with the base concrete, appearing as a lighter gray,
            powdery layer that may obscure surface details and add a chalky finish.
          coverage: Coverage is generally even and light to moderate, with less variation
            due to similar material properties.
          pattern: It often forms a relatively uniform coating or light patches, merging
            with the rough texture of the concrete substrate.
        fabric:
          appearance: On fabric, concrete dust appears as a pale gray, powdery residue
            that can penetrate fibers, causing discoloration and a stiff, gritty texture.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from light dusting to dense accumulation in creases
            and low-lying areas, showing high variation.
          pattern: Distribution is usually spotty or in patches, with dust settling
            into weave patterns and folds of the material.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, concrete dust appears as a fine, light gray powder
            that obscures transparency and creates a hazy, frosted look with a slightly
            gritty feel.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light to moderate, with even spreading on
            vertical surfaces and heavier buildup on horizontal ones.
          pattern: It usually distributes as a thin, uniform film or in scattered
            spots, influenced by static or moisture that causes adhesion.
        metal:
          appearance: Concrete dust appears as a light gray to white powdery coating,
            often dulling the metallic shine and creating a rough, matte texture.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, ranging from light dusting to heavy
            buildup in sheltered spots, with significant variation across the surface.
          pattern: It typically forms uneven patches or streaks, concentrating in
            recessed areas and along edges due to gravity and airflow.
        mineral:
          appearance: Concrete dust deposits as a whitish to gray powdery film on
            minerals, masking natural luster and colors while imparting a dusty, rough
            texture.
          coverage: Coverage varies from sparse to moderate, often concentrated in
            fissures and on horizontal planes.
          pattern: Distribution is typically patchy or streaky, with dust adhering
            to crystalline faces and porous mineral surfaces.
        plastic:
          appearance: Concrete dust appears as a light gray, fine powder that may
            cling electrostatically, creating a dull, slightly rough surface on smooth
            plastics.
          coverage: Coverage is usually light to moderate, with variation based on
            plastic type and environmental factors like humidity.
          pattern: It typically forms uneven patches or a light uniform layer, with
            accumulation in corners and on static-prone areas.
        rubber:
          appearance: Concrete dust coats rubber as a light gray, adherent powder
            that may fill micro-textures, giving a faded, chalky look and slightly
            abrasive feel.
          coverage: Coverage is typically light to moderate, unevenly distributed
            with heavier buildup in grooves and on exposed faces.
          pattern: It often forms patchy or streaky deposits, with dust sticking more
            to tacky or textured rubber surfaces.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, concrete dust appears as a fine, light gray
            contaminant that can cause micro-abrasions and obscure precise surface
            features.
          coverage: Coverage is usually very light and sparse, with critical variation
            in clean environments to prevent damage.
          pattern: It distributes as minute spots or a thin uniform layer, potentially
            affecting sensitive areas due to static attraction.
        specialty:
          appearance: Dust forms a grayish, powdery coating on specialty materials,
            altering custom finishes and textures in a chalky, dull manner.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, ranging from minimal to significant,
            tailored to the specific specialty material's exposure.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material's properties, often appearing
            as irregular patches or streaks on unique surfaces.
        stone:
          appearance: Concrete dust coats stone as a whitish or grayish film, masking
            natural colors and textures while adding a chalky, abrasive finish.
          coverage: Coverage is often moderate to heavy, with denser accumulation
            in crevices and on flat surfaces, showing clear variation.
          pattern: It tends to form irregular patches or a thin uniform layer, clinging
            more to porous or rough-textured areas of the stone.
        wood:
          appearance: The dust appears as a pale gray, gritty layer that can settle
            into the grain, making the wood look faded and feel rough to the touch.
          coverage: Coverage varies from sparse, light coatings to dense layers, especially
            on upward-facing areas, with uneven spread.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, with accumulation in grooves
            and on horizontal surfaces where dust settles easily.

        ceramic:
          appearance: Presents as a glossy or matte coating in colors such as yellow
            or black, altering the ceramic's smooth, hard surface.
          coverage: Generally good and consistent, but imperfections like pinholes
            or uneven edges can occur.
          pattern: Tends to form a relatively uniform layer, though it may exhibit
            streaks or mottling if applied unevenly.
        composite:
          appearance: Appears as a discontinuous film in varied colors, potentially
            highlighting the composite's heterogeneous structure with glossy or dull
            areas.
          coverage: Often partial and variable, with differences in adhesion between
            matrix and reinforcement components.

            material's fiber or filler distribution.
        concrete:
          appearance: Presents as a thin, often dull or colored layer that may look
            powdery or flaky, masking the rough, porous surface.
          coverage: Typically incomplete and highly variable, with large uncovered
            areas due to concrete's high porosity.
          pattern: Distributes in blotches or a mottled pattern, with concentration
            in pores and cracks where residue accumulates.
        fabric:
          appearance: Shows as stiff, discolored areas in metallic or dark hues, altering
            the fabric's texture and making it feel crusty or brittle.
          coverage: Extremely uneven and sparse, with most of the fabric remaining
            uncovered due to absorption and poor adhesion.
          pattern: Appears as random spots or streaks, often following the weave pattern
            where the coating penetrates or sits on fibers.
        glass:
          appearance: Manifests as a hazy, iridescent, or tinted film that can obscure
            transparency, with colors ranging from rainbow-like to dull shades.
          coverage: Can be full and even on clean surfaces, but may show variations
            like thin spots or bubbles if contaminated.
          pattern: Often appears as uniform smears or localized spots, depending on
            application method and surface cleanliness.
        metal:
          appearance: Typically appears as a thin, iridescent or colored film, often
            in shades of gold, brown, or black, with a smooth or slightly textured
            finish.
          coverage: Generally provides full coverage with minimal variation, though
            incomplete coverage may occur in recessed or poorly prepared areas.
          pattern: Usually forms a uniform or near-uniform layer, but can show streaks
            or patches if application is uneven or contaminated.
        mineral:
          appearance: Appears as an unnatural, shiny or tinted coating that can obscure
            the mineral's natural luster and crystal structure.
          coverage: Generally partial and inconsistent, with variations based on mineral
            composition and surface smoothness.
          pattern: Forms irregular patches or a streaked effect, often adhering better
            to certain crystal faces or inclusions.
        plastic:
          appearance: Looks like an adherent, often metallic or dark film that may
            appear flaky or cracked, contrasting with the plastic's original finish.
          coverage: Typically poor and inconsistent, with large areas uncovered due
            to low surface energy and chemical incompatibility.
          pattern: Shows as irregular patches or a non-uniform layer, as plastics
            often resist adhesion, leading to peeling or beading.
        rubber:
          appearance: Manifests as a flaky or peeling coating in dark or iridescent
            shades, often cracking due to rubber's flexibility and surface oils.
          coverage: Generally poor and non-uniform, with significant peeling and exposed
            areas common.
          pattern: Forms irregular patches or a speckled effect, as the coating fails
            to bond uniformly on the elastic surface.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Shows as a thin, often metallic or oxide-like film that may
            cause discoloration or hazing, affecting the pristine surface.
          coverage: Can range from full to patchy, with critical areas like circuits
            showing variations that impact performance.
          pattern: Tends to be uniform if intentional, but as contamination, it appears
            as localized spots or a non-uniform layer.
        specialty:
          appearance: Varies widely by material, but generally appears as an adherent,
            discolored film that contrasts with the unique surface properties.
          coverage: Highly variable and often poor, tailored to the material's specific
            chemical and physical resistance.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the specialty material's characteristics,
            often forming irregular patches or a non-uniform coating.
        stone:
          appearance: Shows as a thin, often shiny or discolored layer in hues like
            bronze or green, masking the stone's natural texture and color.
          coverage: Usually incomplete and variable, with poor adhesion leading to
            patchy areas and exposed stone.
          pattern: Distributes unevenly, forming blotches or streaks, especially on
            rough or porous surfaces where adhesion is inconsistent.
        wood:
          appearance: Appears as an unnatural, glossy or matte film, often in metallic
            or dark colors, contrasting with the wood's natural grain and texture.
          coverage: Typically partial and uneven, with significant variation due to
            wood's porous and absorbent nature.
          pattern: Forms irregular patches or streaks where the coating adheres poorly,
            often pooling in grooves or along edges.

            coolant has contacted and evaporated.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, it appears as whitish, powdery coatings or sticky
            films that may cause swelling or degradation over time.
          coverage: Coverage can range from light, spotty areas to more extensive
            coatings if the rubber absorbs the coolant.
          pattern: It typically distributes in blotches or uniform layers, especially
            on surfaces exposed to coolant spills.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, it appears as microscopic, white or translucent
            residues that can cause electrical failures and surface hazing.
          coverage: Coverage is typically minimal and localized, but even small amounts
            can lead to significant performance issues.
          pattern: It forms in fine, uneven spots or films, often concentrated around
            edges or contamination points.
        specialty:
          appearance: Engine coolant scale on specialty materials varies but often
            appears as white, adherent deposits that may corrode or degrade unique
            surfaces.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, ranging from isolated spots to widespread
            areas, influenced by material composition and exposure.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material, but it generally forms in
            patches or streaks where coolant is present.
        stone:
          appearance: Engine coolant scale on stone appears as white or off-white
            powdery or crusty residues that can etch or stain the surface.
          coverage: Coverage is typically patchy and variable, ranging from small
            areas to more extensive sections if not cleaned promptly.
          pattern: It forms in irregular patches or concentrated spots, often following
            the path of coolant runoff or pooling.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, it shows as whitish or grayish crystalline deposits
            that can feel gritty and may cause discoloration or surface damage.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and uneven, limited to exposed areas
            in contact with the coolant.
          pattern: Distribution is often in random spots or streaks where coolant

    category: oxidation
    chemical_formula: Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂
    description: '[Copper](../materials/copper.md) patina stands out from other oxidations
      by forming a distinctive green layer on copper surfaces through prolonged air
      and moisture exposure. This adherent film clings tightly to reactive metals,
      accelerating corrosion beneath, while it spreads unevenly on inert non-metals,
      creating patchy buildup. It resists simple removal, embedding into substrates
      and complicating cleaning on delicate alloys without scratching or residue.
      Laser methods strip it cleanly, restoring original luster.'

          description: Copper patina forms as blue-green crystalline deposits that
            adhere to ceramic surfaces, particularly in unglazed areas and surface
            imperfections. On glazed ceramics, it appears as surface staining, while
            on porous bodies like terracotta it penetrates deeply. The contamination
            creates a crusty texture that contrasts with the smooth ceramic surface.
          distribution_patterns: Follows surface imperfections and porosity, accumulates
            in low areas and joints
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and imperfections, centers remain cleaner
            on glazed surfaces
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in carved details, rough textures, and complex
            shapes; minimal on smooth, glazed surfaces

            uniform films
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: scattered spots <30%, Moderate: 30-60% coverage,
            Heavy: >60% continuous staining'
          description: Copper patina appears as blue-green deposits that accumulate
            in composite surface imperfections and along fiber boundaries. The contamination
            typically follows the composite microstructure, creating patterned discoloration
            that highlights the material's internal structure. On fiberglass, it may
            penetrate between fibers, while on carbon fiber it remains superficial.
          distribution_patterns: Follows composite microstructure, accumulates in
            surface imperfections and along edges
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and surface imperfections, then spreads
            following composite structure

            crack-following patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: scattered crystalline spots <30%, Moderate: 30-60%
            coverage with merging, Heavy: >60% continuous crust'
          description: Verdigris appears as blue-green crystalline deposits that accumulate
            in concrete pores and surface imperfections. The contamination typically
            forms crusty deposits that highlight the concrete's porous nature and
            surface texture. On reinforced concrete, it may indicate corrosion of
            embedded copper elements.
          distribution_patterns: Follows concrete porosity and surface texture, accumulates
            in low areas and along joints
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges, joints, and surface imperfections,
            then spreads across surface
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in rough textures, joints, and complex shapes;
            minimal on smooth, sealed surfaces
          gravity_influence: Clear vertical streaking, accumulation in lower areas
            and drainage paths

            color showing through
          common_patterns: Weave-following patterns, water spot marks, edge darkening,
            splatter patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: faint staining along fibers <30%, Moderate: 30-60%
            distinct coloration, Heavy: >60% uniform deep staining'
          description: Copper patina appears as blue-green staining that penetrates
            fabric fibers, creating discolored patterns that follow the weave structure.
            The contamination typically appears as deep staining rather than surface
            deposits, with the fabric texture remaining visible. The visual effect
            is color penetration that follows fiber orientation.
          distribution_patterns: Follows fabric weave and porosity, accumulates in
            folds and seams
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges, folds, and seams, centers remain cleaner
            until advanced stages
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in folds, seams, and complex shapes; follows
            fabric weave pattern
          gravity_influence: Clear vertical streaking, accumulation in lower sections

            slightly stiff if heavy
        glass:
          color_variations: Pale blue haze to distinct green spots, sometimes with
            iridescent effects
          common_patterns: Uniform haze, spotty deposits, edge darkening, water droplet
            patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: faint haze <30%, Moderate: 30-60% visible film,
            Heavy: >60% opaque coating'
          description: Verdigris appears as hazy blue-green films or spotty deposits
            that reduce glass transparency and create light scattering. The contamination
            typically forms as surface films rather than penetrating, creating optical
            distortions and reduced clarity. On crystal glass, it may form intricate
            crystalline patterns.
          distribution_patterns: Forms films across entire surface, with concentration
            at edges and in stagnant areas
          edge_center_behavior: Uniform across surface with slight edge preference
            in early stages
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in corners and complex shapes; uniform on flat
            surfaces
          gravity_influence: Minimal direct influence, though runoff patterns may
            create vertical streaking
          texture_details: Smooth film or spotty crystalline deposits, surface feels
            slightly rough under magnification
        metal:
          color_variations: Light green to deep turquoise, blue-green, with occasional
            brown or black undertones in advanced stages
          common_patterns: Spots, streaks, uniform films, dendritic patterns following
            surface imperfections
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: scattered spots <30%, Moderate: 30-60% coverage
            with some merging, Heavy: >60% continuous film'
          description: Copper patina appears as a greenish-blue crystalline or powdery
            deposit on metal surfaces, often with a rough, crust-like texture. On
            copper and brass, it forms naturally through oxidation, while on other
            metals it indicates copper contamination from external sources. The contamination
            typically creates uneven surface topography that can interfere with laser
            reflectance and absorption.
          distribution_patterns: Starts at high points and edges, spreads unevenly
            across surface following moisture paths
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges, corners, and high points initially,
            then spreads toward centers
          geometry_effects: Enhanced formation on sharp edges, corners, and complex
            geometries; reduced on flat, smooth surfaces
          gravity_influence: Dripping patterns evident, accumulation in lower areas
            due to runoff
          texture_details: Crystalline, powdery, or crust-like surface with rough
            micro-texture, often flaky or granular
        mineral:

            on crystalline surfaces
          common_patterns: Crystal-face coatings, spotty deposits, uniform films,
            dendritic patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: scattered coatings <30%, Moderate: 30-60% coverage,
            Heavy: >60% continuous coating'
          description: Copper patina appears as blue-green crystalline coatings that
            form on mineral surfaces, often creating intricate patterns that follow
            crystal structures. The contamination typically appears as surface coatings
            rather than penetration, though it may interact with certain minerals
            chemically. The visual effect highlights the mineral's natural crystal
            forms.
          distribution_patterns: Follows crystal structures and surface imperfections,
            accumulates in depressions
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers crystal edges and imperfections, then spreads
            across crystal faces
          geometry_effects: Enhanced on crystal edges and complex shapes; follows
            mineral crystal structure
          gravity_influence: Minimal direct influence on small specimens, though accumulation
            may occur in lower areas
          texture_details: Crystalline coatings or films, surface texture follows
            underlying mineral structure
        plastic:
          color_variations: Pale blue to green staining, sometimes with iridescent
            effects on smooth surfaces
          common_patterns: Uniform films, spotty deposits, edge darkening, water mark
            patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: faint staining <30%, Moderate: 30-60% visible film,
            Heavy: >60% opaque coating'
          description: Verdigris appears as blue-green staining or surface films that
            adhere to plastic surfaces, often creating hazy or spotty discoloration.
            The contamination typically forms surface films rather than penetrating,
            though it may cause slight surface etching on some plastics. The visual
            effect is primarily color change with minimal texture alteration.
          distribution_patterns: Forms across entire surface with concentration in
            stagnant areas and along flow paths
          edge_center_behavior: Uniform across surface with slight edge preference

            in advanced stages
          common_patterns: Uniform films, spotty deposits, edge darkening, crack-following
            patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: faint staining <30%, Moderate: 30-60% visible film,
            Heavy: >60% deep staining'
          description: Verdigris appears as blue-green surface staining that may slightly
            penetrate rubber surfaces, creating discolored patterns. The contamination
            typically forms surface films that can become slightly embedded in the
            rubber matrix. The visual effect is color change with minimal texture
            alteration, though advanced stages may cause surface cracking.
          distribution_patterns: Forms across entire surface with concentration in
            stagnant areas and along seams
          edge_center_behavior: Uniform across surface with slight edge and seam preference
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in seams and complex shapes; uniform on flat
            surfaces

          description: Verdigris appears as blue-green surface contamination that
            forms thin films or spotty deposits on semiconductor surfaces. The contamination
            typically appears as surface films that can interfere with electronic
            properties and optical characteristics. On silicon, it may form uniform
            hazing, while on compound semiconductors it may create patterned discoloration.
          distribution_patterns: Forms across entire surface with concentration in
            stagnant areas and along flow paths
          edge_center_behavior: Uniform across surface with slight edge preference
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in patterned areas and complex geometries; uniform
            on flat wafer surfaces
          gravity_influence: Minimal direct influence, though vertical streaking may
            occur from processing fluids
          texture_details: Smooth films or spotty deposits, surface may feel unchanged
            under normal handling
        specialty:

          description: Copper patina appears as blue-green surface contamination that
            varies significantly depending on the specialty material's properties.
            On aerogel, it may form superficial staining, while on graphene it appears
            as spotty deposits. The contamination typically highlights the material's
            unique surface characteristics and may interact differently with advanced
            material structures.
          distribution_patterns: Follows material-specific surface characteristics
            and microstructure
          edge_center_behavior: Material-dependent - generally prefers edges and surface
            imperfections
          geometry_effects: Highly material-dependent, follows unique surface structures
            and geometries
          gravity_influence: Variable depending on material porosity and surface energy

          description: Copper patina appears as blue-green crystalline deposits that
            accumulate in stone pores and surface imperfections. On porous stones
            like limestone, it penetrates deeply, while on dense stones like granite
            it forms surface crusts. The contamination creates a mottled appearance
            that contrasts with the natural stone color.
          distribution_patterns: Follows natural stone porosity, accumulates in surface
            depressions and along joints
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and joints initially, then spreads across
            surface following porosity patterns
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in carved details, rough textures, and joints;
            minimal on polished, flat surfaces

          description: Verdigris appears as blue-green staining that penetrates wood
            grain, creating discolored patterns that follow the natural wood structure.
            The contamination typically appears as surface staining rather than crust
            formation, with the wood grain remaining visible through the coloration.
            The visual effect is more of a deep stain than a surface deposit.
          distribution_patterns: Follows wood grain direction, accumulates in porous
            areas and end grain
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and end grain, centers remain cleaner
            until advanced stages
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in carved areas, joints, and rough surfaces;
            minimal on smooth, sealed surfaces
          gravity_influence: Vertical dripping patterns, accumulation in lower sections
            and joints
          texture_details: Wood grain remains visible, surface feels slightly rough

            or thin spots.
          pattern: Typically forms a uniform film, but may show streaks, smudges,
            or droplets if not evenly applied.
        metal:
          appearance: Often appears as a glossy or matte film, typically clear, yellowish,
            or greenish, with a smooth or slightly oily texture.
          coverage: Generally provides full, even coverage; variations may occur at
            edges or in recessed areas.
          pattern: Usually forms a uniform layer, but can show streaks or patches
            if applied unevenly or degraded.
        mineral:
          appearance: Appears as a coating that may be clear or slightly colored,
            often enhancing or dulling the mineral's natural luster and crystal faces.
          coverage: Ranges from partial to full, with variations due to mineral hardness
            and surface geometry.
          pattern: Generally uniform, but can form streaks or concentrated patches
            in fissures or on specific crystal planes.
        plastic:
          appearance: Manifests as a slick, oily, or waxy layer, typically transparent
            or with a slight hue, altering the plastic's shine and feel.
          coverage: Tends to be full and even; poor adhesion can cause spotty coverage
            on certain plastics.
          pattern: Generally uniform, but may form beads, streaks, or patches due
            to surface tension or improper application.
        rubber:
          appearance: Presents as a greasy or waxy coating, typically clear or light-colored,
            making the rubber surface appear slick or slightly discolored.
          coverage: Generally full coverage; can be spotty if the rubber is highly
            textured or contaminated.
          pattern: Often uniform, but may pool in grooves or form uneven patches due
            to rubber's flexibility and surface irregularities.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Presents as an ultra-thin, often invisible or faintly iridescent
            layer under magnification, potentially causing hazing or color shifts
            on surfaces.
          coverage: Designed for full, even coverage; defects can lead to localized
            variations affecting performance.
          pattern: Typically uniform to ensure functionality, but contamination may
            appear as micro-streaks or spots from improper deposition.
        specialty:
          appearance: Varies widely; may appear as a tailored film—clear, colored,
            or textured—specific to the material's unique properties and intended
            use.
          coverage: Aimed at precise coverage, from partial to full, with variations
            based on specialty requirements and surface conditions.
          pattern: Customized for uniformity or specific designs, but can show inconsistencies
            like streaks or patches if application is flawed.
        stone:
          appearance: Presents as a thin, often transparent or slightly tinted film,
            giving a wet look or altering the stone's natural color and texture.
          coverage: Varies from spotty to full coverage, depending on stone type and
            application consistency.
          pattern: Usually uniform, but can appear streaky or patchy on porous surfaces
            where absorption is uneven.
        wood:
          appearance: Manifests as a waxy or oily coating, often clear or light-colored,
            altering the natural grain with a sheen or dull finish.
          coverage: Typically partial to full coverage, with variations due to wood
            porosity and application method.
          pattern: Tends to be uniform across surfaces, but may pool in grain lines
            or form patches if not properly absorbed.

    description: 'Workers apply cutting fluids in metal machining to cool tools and
      lubricate parts. These fluids build up as sticky residues through evaporation
      and splatter. Turns out, this contamination forms oily films that cling to surfaces.
      It stands out from dust or rust due to its rancid, bacteria-prone layer that
      resists wipes.


      On [steel](../materials/steel.md), it bonds firmly and dulls finishes. Aluminum
      shows lighter etching and pitting over time. Brass develops a hazy sheen, while
      titanium repels most but traps pockets in cracks. Solvents soak slowly, and
      scrubbing risks scratches that restart the mess—a significant challenge overall.


      Laser cleaning works out effectively by vaporizing layers without contact. It
      delivers a clean finish and tight tolerances across these metals.'

            stains to larger patches, with uneven variation depending on fabric absorbency.
          pattern: It tends to form irregular spots or blotches, spreading along the
            weave and concentrating in absorbent areas, with distribution influenced
            by fabric type.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, the residue appears as a translucent or slightly cloudy
            film that can cause haziness or rainbow-like iridescence, often making
            the surface look smeared or less clear.
          coverage: Coverage is often widespread but thin, ranging from nearly complete
            films in some areas to partial coverage with variations in thickness.
          pattern: It typically forms uniform thin layers or irregular streaks, spreading
            across the surface and sometimes pooling at edges or in low spots.
        metal:
          appearance: Machining coolant residue on metal appears as a thin, oily film
            that can range from clear to milky white or slightly discolored, often
            giving the surface a wet or greasy look.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and uneven, varying from light spotting
            to extensive areas depending on the machining process and coolant application.
          pattern: It typically forms irregular streaks or patches, following the
            paths of coolant flow or machining operations, and may concentrate in
            recessed areas or around tool contact points.
        mineral:
          appearance: On minerals, machining coolant residue manifests as a greasy,
            often dark film that can obscure natural colors and crystal faces, leaving
            a dull or oily sheen.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and irregular, ranging from light
            filming to concentrated patches depending on mineral hardness and surface
            condition.
          pattern: It typically appears as random spots or thin layers, adhering to
            surface features and accumulating in fractures or rough areas, with no
            set pattern.

          appearance: On plastic, the residue appears as an oily, sometimes cloudy
            film that can cause discoloration or a greasy feel, often making the surface
            look wet or smudged.
          coverage: Coverage is typically irregular and partial, ranging from isolated
            spots to larger areas, with variations based on plastic type and coolant
            properties.
          pattern: It tends to form streaks or patches, spreading unevenly and possibly
            beading up on hydrophobic plastics, with distribution influenced by surface
            energy.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, the residue appears as a dark, greasy coating that
            can cause swelling or a tacky feel, often leading to a shiny or stained
            surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally widespread but variable, ranging from thin,
            even layers to thicker, patchy areas based on rubber composition and exposure
            time.
          pattern: It typically forms uniform films or irregular patches, spreading
            across the surface and possibly absorbing into the material, with no consistent
            pattern.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, the residue appears as a thin, often invisible
            or slightly hazy film that can interfere with electrical properties, sometimes
            visible under magnification as contaminants.
          coverage: Coverage is typically extensive and uniform in thin layers, but
            can vary to partial coverage with micro-variations, critical for performance
            integrity.
          pattern: It tends to form uniform or micro-spotted layers, spreading evenly
            across the surface and potentially concentrating at edges or defects,
            with precise distribution.
        specialty:
          appearance: On specialty materials, machining coolant residue varies widely
            but often appears as an oily or filmy coating that can alter surface properties,
            such as causing discoloration or reduced functionality.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable and material-dependent, ranging from
            minimal, isolated areas to near-complete films, influenced by specific
            composition and exposure.
          pattern: It generally forms irregular distributions like patches or streaks,
            adapting to the material's unique structure—e.g., layered in laminates
            or spotted on coated surfaces.
        stone:
          appearance: On stone, machining coolant residue manifests as dark, greasy
            spots or a faint film that can alter the natural color, often leaving
            a slippery or dull finish on the surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and uneven, with variations from
            minor spotting to more extensive patches based on surface roughness and
            coolant exposure.
          pattern: It usually appears as random spots or streaks, concentrating in
            textured or porous regions and following the contours of the stone, without
            a consistent pattern.

            spots to larger areas depending on the removal method and surface exposure.
          pattern: It typically forms irregular streaks or patches, following the
            path of removal tools or abrasion, and may concentrate in high-wear areas.
        mineral:
          appearance: On minerals, it looks like dark, oily coatings that can mask
            crystalline structures and natural colors, giving a dull or contaminated
            sheen.
          coverage: Coverage is usually light and uneven, with variations based on
            mineral hardness and the extent of removal activities.
          pattern: It commonly forms in patches or thin layers, following mineral
            cleavage or external contacts, and may be spotty or uniform.
        plastic:
          appearance: It looks like faint, grayish films or scratches on plastic,
            potentially causing a loss of luster and introducing a dirty, matte finish.
          coverage: Coverage is often light and patchy, with variations based on plastic
            type and the intensity of removal processes.
          pattern: Distribution is typically in streaks or spots, influenced by surface
            smoothness and mechanical actions, sometimes forming uniform thin layers.
        rubber:
          appearance: It manifests as black, greasy smudges or films on rubber, often
            deepening the natural dark color and adding a slick, contaminated texture.
          coverage: Coverage is typically light to moderate and uneven, with higher
            amounts in high-contact zones and variations due to rubber elasticity.
          pattern: The contamination commonly appears in smears or spots, aligning
            with flex points or handling areas, and can be streaky or blotchy.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: It appears as microscopic, hazy films or particles on semiconductor
            surfaces, potentially causing visual defects and interfering with optical
            properties.
          coverage: Coverage is typically minimal and highly variable, with precise
            amounts critical to performance, often partial and controlled to avoid
            damage.
          pattern: Distribution is often in fine spots or uniform layers, influenced
            by processing steps and contamination sources, and may be concentrated
            in specific regions.
        specialty:
          appearance: On specialty materials, it manifests as tailored discolorations
            or residues, such as dull films on coatings or smudges on advanced polymers,
            adapting to material specifics.

          pattern: It forms in patterns specific to the material's use, like streaks
            on high-tech surfaces or patches on custom composites, often irregular
            or designed.
        stone:
          appearance: It shows up as dark, greasy-looking films or discolorations
            on stone surfaces, potentially masking the natural texture and hues.
          coverage: Coverage is often patchy and variable, ranging from isolated areas
            to broader sections, depending on stone type and exposure.
          pattern: Distribution is commonly in irregular patches or smears, influenced
            by surface roughness and cleaning actions, sometimes forming concentrated
            spots.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, it manifests as dark, sooty stains or smears that can
            obscure the natural grain and color, giving a dirty or weathered look.
          coverage: Coverage tends to be sporadic and light to moderate, with variations
            based on wood porosity and the extent of removal efforts.
          pattern: The contamination often appears in blotchy patches or streaks,
            aligning with wood grain or tool marks, and may be unevenly distributed.

    description: Electroplating-residue contamination, it arises from chemical deposits
      in bath solutions during the plating process, and forms thin adherent layers
      on metal surfaces. This residue, it distinguishes by crystalline structure and
      chemical inertness from oxide scales or dust particles; on steel it embrittles
      surface, on brass it corrodes selectively, while on copper it conducts poorly
      and still persists stubbornly, so strong bonding resists mechanical removal.
      Laser cleaning ablates residue precisely with pulsed energy, without damaging
      substrate, and thus restores conductivity already.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: It presents as shiny, metallic coatings or dull stains, often
            in colors like gold or nickel, that may flake or peel on glazed surfaces.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and inconsistent, with higher amounts
            in porous regions and less on smooth, glazed parts.
          pattern: Patterns are often spotty or streaky, concentrating in unglazed
            areas or along cracks where absorption occurs.
        composite:
          appearance: It shows as blotchy, metallic stains or films that may highlight
            fiber or filler patterns, altering the composite's uniform look.
          coverage: Coverage is variable and patchy, often concentrated in porous
            or rough zones of the composite.
          pattern: Distribution is irregular, with patches or streaks that align with
            material heterogeneity, such as along fiber boundaries.
        concrete:
          appearance: Residue appears as glossy, metallic films or powdery deposits
            that can darken or stain the concrete, often in speckled patterns.

            regions and little on smooth surfaces.
          pattern: It distributes patchily, concentrating in pores, cracks, or rough
            areas where residue adheres more easily.
        fabric:
          appearance: It manifests as stiff, discolored patches with metallic sheens
            or stains, potentially hardening the fabric and altering its color.

            minimal overall spread.
          pattern: Patterns are spotty or streaky, following weave patterns or areas
            of direct contact with the solution.
        glass:
          appearance: Residue appears as iridescent, cloudy, or rainbow-hued films,
            sometimes with gritty textures that reduce transparency and clarity.
          coverage: Coverage can range from nearly uniform thin layers to partial
            streaks, with variation based on application method.

            drip marks or edges where solution dried.
        metal:
          appearance: Electroplating residue appears as dull, discolored patches or
            streaks, often with a hazy or cloudy finish that contrasts with the metal's
            natural luster.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial and uneven, ranging from small spots
            to larger areas, with significant variation across the surface.
          pattern: It typically forms irregular streaks or patches, following the
            flow paths of the solution during application or drying.
        mineral:
          appearance: It shows as shiny, metallic coatings or dull films that may
            obscure crystal faces or natural colors, sometimes with a crusty texture.
          coverage: Coverage is often low and uneven, focusing on exposed or fractured
            areas with minimal uniform spread.
          pattern: Patterns are irregular, with spots or streaks following mineral
            cleavage planes or surface imperfections.
        plastic:
          appearance: Residue appears as oily, smeared films or powdery deposits in
            metallic shades, potentially causing discoloration or a tacky feel on
            the plastic.
          coverage: Coverage is typically low and uneven, with spots and streaks that
            vary widely across the material.
          pattern: It distributes as random patches or smears, often following surface
            contours or static charge areas.
        rubber:
          appearance: Residue appears as sticky, shiny coatings or dull crusts in
            metallic colors, which can penetrate and discolor the rubber surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and localized, with high variation
            due to rubber's elasticity and surface texture.
          pattern: It forms blotches or streaks, often in creases or textured areas
            where solution is trapped.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Residue appears as thin, hazy films or speckles in metallic
            hues, which can interfere with electrical properties and surface smoothness.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from nearly uniform micro-layers to isolated patches,
            with precise variation critical for performance.
          pattern: It forms uniform thin layers or localized spots, often aligned
            with processing steps or contamination sources.
        specialty:
          appearance: Residue varies widely but often appears as irregular metallic
            stains or films, tailored to the material's unique properties like conductivity
            or reflectivity.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable and specific, designed for functional
            needs but often uneven in practice.
          pattern: Distribution is material-dependent, typically patchy or streaky,
            influenced by surface treatments and environmental factors.
        stone:
          appearance: It shows up as glossy or matte films, often in metallic colors,
            creating a speckled or stained look that may obscure the stone's natural
            texture.
          coverage: Coverage is typically low to moderate and uneven, with dense patches
            in recessed areas and minimal coverage on smooth surfaces.
          pattern: Distribution is patchy or streaky, following surface irregularities
            and crevices where residue accumulates.
        wood:
          appearance: Residue manifests as shiny, sticky, or crusty deposits, often
            in metallic hues like silver or copper, and can darken or stain the wood
            surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and localized, with high variation
            depending on wood porosity and exposure.
          pattern: It appears as random spots or streaks, concentrating in grain patterns
            or low-lying areas where solution pools.

            vertical glass may have uneven dust layers.
          pattern: It forms streaks and spots, often uniform on flat surfaces but
            patchy near edges or from airflow disturbances.
        metal:
          appearance: Environmental dust appears as a fine, grayish layer that dulls
            the metallic shine and can feel gritty to the touch.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial to full, varying with exposure;
            sheltered spots may have less dust.
          pattern: It often forms in streaks or patches, influenced by airflow and
            surface orientation, with accumulation in recessed areas.
        mineral:
          appearance: Dust settles as a fine, earthy coating in colors like gray or
            brown, masking the mineral's luster and crystalline features.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from sparse to partial, varying with mineral hardness
            and exposure to dust sources.
          pattern: Distribution is irregular, with spots and patches adhering to crystalline
            structures or cleavage planes.
        plastic:
          appearance: Dust forms a fine, light-colored layer, often gray or beige,
            that can cling electrostatically and feel slightly abrasive.
          coverage: Coverage is typically light to moderate, with variations based
            on surface smoothness and environmental factors.
          pattern: It tends to be uniform on smooth surfaces but may show streaks
            or spots on textured or charged areas.
        rubber:
          appearance: Dust settles as a dark, gritty film in gray or black tones,
            sticking to the flexible surface and appearing matte.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, with heavier buildup in crevices
            and lighter on smooth, exposed areas.
          pattern: It forms in patches and streaks, accumulating in grooves or low
            spots from movement and environmental settling.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Dust appears as an ultra-fine, light-colored film, often gray
            or white, that can cause micro-scratches and reduce surface reflectivity.
          coverage: Coverage is typically minimal but critical, with even light dust
            posing risks to functionality in controlled environments.
          pattern: It tends to be uniform or speckled, with distribution influenced
            by static charges and cleanroom conditions.
        specialty:
          appearance: Dust forms a variable layer depending on the material, often
            in neutral hues, adapting to unique surfaces like coatings or sensitive
            finishes.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely, from negligible to significant, based
            on the material's properties and exposure levels.
          pattern: Distribution is highly irregular, tailored to the specialty item's
            shape, texture, and environmental interactions.
        stone:
          appearance: Dust creates a muted, dusty layer in gray or beige hues, blending
            with the stone's natural color and rough texture.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial, with denser buildup in indentations
            and lighter coverage on smooth, exposed areas.
          pattern: It accumulates in patches and streaks, following surface contours
            and crevices for an irregular distribution.
        wood:
          appearance: Dust settles as a light, powdery film in earthy tones like gray
            or brown, clinging to the grain and rough textures.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from sparse to moderate, often heavier on horizontal
            surfaces and less on vertical ones.
          pattern: Distribution is uneven, with patches and streaks along grooves
            or raised areas due to surface irregularities.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Epoxy resin on ceramic shows as shiny, hardened coatings in
            various colors, sometimes with a smooth or slightly textured feel that
            contrasts with the ceramic glaze.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, with small to moderate areas affected,
            varying with application technique and ceramic porosity.
          pattern: It typically forms in spots, runs, or patches, often pooling in
            decorative grooves or uneven areas of the ceramic surface.
        composite:
          appearance: On composites, epoxy contamination looks like integrated or
            surface-level glossy coatings, matching or contrasting with the composite
            matrix in color and texture.
          coverage: Coverage can be extensive in manufacturing or spotty in repairs,
            with variations based on composite type and resin application.
          pattern: It may form uniform layers, streaks, or localized patches, following
            the composite's fibrous or layered structure.
        concrete:
          appearance: Epoxy contamination on concrete looks like glossy, sealed patches
            or coatings, often in clear or gray tones that fill pores and create a
            smooth, durable surface.
          coverage: Coverage can be partial for spills or full in coatings, with variations
            due to concrete porosity and application method.
          pattern: It typically appears as uneven patches, streaks, or pooled areas,
            adhering to rough concrete textures and cracks.
        fabric:
          appearance: On fabric, epoxy resin shows as stiff, shiny areas that harden
            the fibers, appearing in clear or dyed forms with a plastic-like, often
            brittle finish.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from small stains to larger impregnated sections,
            varying with fabric absorbency and resin amount.
          pattern: It forms in irregular spots, drips, or soaked patches, following
            the weave pattern and potentially causing discoloration or saturation.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, epoxy deposits are visible as clear or slightly cloudy,
            glossy layers that may have bubbles or inclusions, adhering tightly to
            the smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage can range from thin, widespread films to thick, isolated
            patches, depending on how the resin is applied and cured.
          pattern: They often appear as uniform films, drips, or irregular blobs,
            spreading evenly or accumulating at edges due to surface tension.
        metal:
          appearance: Epoxy deposits on metal appear as glossy, translucent to opaque
            coatings, often in amber, clear, or white hues with a smooth or slightly
            textured finish.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, ranging from small spots to large
            areas, with variations depending on application method and surface conditions.
          pattern: They typically form in irregular patches or streaks, following
            surface contours or pooling in low areas due to gravity and adhesion.
        mineral:
          appearance: On minerals, epoxy deposits appear as glossy, transparent or
            opaque films that may enhance or obscure natural colors and crystal structures.
          coverage: Coverage is usually targeted and partial, such as in crack filling
            or surface sealing, with amounts varying by mineral type.
          pattern: They form in localized spots, fills, or coatings, often following
            mineral fractures or surface features for stabilization or display.
        plastic:
          appearance: Deposits on plastic appear as glossy, adherent layers that can
            be clear or pigmented, sometimes causing slight clouding or a slick texture
            on the plastic surface.
          coverage: Coverage varies from isolated spots to larger sections, often
            non-uniform due to differences in plastic surface energy.
          pattern: They distribute as irregular patches, streaks, or drips, influenced
            by plastic smoothness and chemical compatibility with the resin.
        rubber:
          appearance: Epoxy deposits on rubber appear as stiff, glossy films that
            can crack or peel, often in clear or colored forms contrasting with the
            rubber's flexible surface.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and patchy, as epoxy does not bond
            well to rubber, resulting in scattered contamination.
          pattern: Distribution is typically in blotches or streaks, with poor adhesion
            leading to flaking or beading on the rubber texture.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Epoxy contamination on semiconductors appears as thin, glossy
            layers that can be clear or colored, potentially interfering with electronic
            properties and surface planarity.
          coverage: Coverage is typically controlled and partial in manufacturing,
            but can vary from minimal spots to full encapsulation in devices.
          pattern: It distributes as uniform films, spots, or streaks, often from
            encapsulation processes or accidental spills on delicate components.
        specialty:
          appearance: On specialty materials like advanced alloys or polymers, epoxy
            deposits show as customized glossy coatings, tailored in color and texture
            for specific applications or contaminants.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, from precise, minimal applications
            to extensive coatings, based on the specialty material's use and epoxy
            function.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material's unique properties, forming
            uniform layers, patterned applications, or irregular patches as required.
        stone:
          appearance: Epoxy contamination on stone appears as glossy, often colored
            or clear films that can fill pores and cracks, creating a reflective or
            matte finish depending on curing.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial, with localized spots or broad patches,
            and varies based on stone type and resin application.
          pattern: It tends to form in blotches, streaks, or filled fissures, following
            natural stone irregularities and surface imperfections.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, epoxy resin deposits look like shiny, hardened layers
            that can be clear or tinted, enhancing or obscuring the grain with a smooth,
            glass-like surface.
          coverage: It varies from thin, spotty coatings to full coverage in art or
            repair projects, influenced by wood porosity and resin viscosity.
          pattern: Distribution is often uneven, with pooling in grooves or cracks,
            and may form drips, runs, or patches based on wood texture and application.

            lines, and may concentrate on textured or low areas.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, deposits manifest as dark, grimy coatings in black
            or brownish shades, with a slightly oily or powdery texture that can embed
            into flexible surfaces.
          coverage: Coverage is usually light and uneven, with sparse to moderate
            buildup that varies with rubber type and usage conditions.
          pattern: They form in streaks or patches, often aligned with stress points
            or grooves, and may show smeared patterns from movement.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, deposits manifest as microscopic, dark particulate
            films that can appear grayish, with a fine, powdery texture potentially
            affecting surface conductivity.

            porous areas, with streaks from environmental factors.
        plastic:
          appearance: Melting, warping, or charring with black soot deposits; surfaces
            may become sticky, dull, or discolored.
          coverage: Varies widely, from light soot films to extensive melting and
            coverage in high-heat zones.
          pattern: Irregular patches or streaks, with melting concentrated near heat
            and soot settling on cooler parts.
        rubber:
          appearance: Softening, melting, or hardening with black soot coating; may
            show cracking, swelling, or a sticky residue.
          coverage: Light to complete, depending on fire proximity, often covering
            surfaces evenly but with variable depth.
          pattern: Typically in patches or uniform layers, with damage focused on
            areas exposed to direct heat or smoke.

            components, following airflow patterns.
        specialty:
          appearance: Varies widely; may include discoloration, soot layers, or structural
            changes like warping, depending on material composition.
          coverage: Highly variable, from minimal to full coverage, based on the specialty
            material's properties and fire exposure.
          pattern: Irregular or material-specific, such as streaking on polished surfaces
            or patching on composites, influenced by fire dynamics.
        stone:
          appearance: Soot and ash create dark gray or black stains; surface may appear
            dull or etched, with possible discoloration from heat.

      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Dark brown to blackish stains with a gritty, matte finish that
            stands out against the ceramic's smooth glaze.
          coverage: Low to moderate, with uneven distribution due to ceramic's hard,
            non-porous surface.
          pattern: Appears as random spots or smears, often in areas where metal contact
            or settling occurs.
        composite:
          appearance: Reddish-brown, flaky deposits that can embed in the matrix,
            creating a mottled, textured look.
          coverage: Variable, ranging from isolated areas to more extensive coverage
            in porous or rough composites.
          pattern: Often distributed as patches or streaks, influenced by the composite's
            surface roughness and composition.
        concrete:
          appearance: Dark reddish-brown, crusty deposits that contrast with the concrete's
            gray, rough surface.
          coverage: Can range from light spotting to heavy coverage in damp or industrial
            settings.
          pattern: Commonly seen as scattered spots or larger patches, especially
            in porous or cracked areas.
        fabric:
          appearance: Rust-colored streaks or spots that feel gritty and can stain
            the fibers, altering the fabric's texture.
          coverage: Sparse to moderate, with variation based on fabric type and exposure
            to contaminated environments.
          pattern: Forms as irregular streaks or patches, often following the weave
            or areas of contact.

        fabric:
          appearance: Varnish on fabric appears as dark, greasy stains that soak into
            fibers, causing stiffening and color changes.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from small spots to large stained areas, influenced
            by fabric type and fuel amount.
          pattern: It distributes in irregular patches or streaks, following the fabric
            weave and fuel absorption paths.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, it shows as a hazy, yellowish or brownish film that
            reduces transparency and may feel slightly tacky.
          coverage: Coverage is often thin and widespread but can be patchy in high-splash
            zones.
          pattern: It typically appears as uniform films or streaks, especially in
            areas exposed to fuel vapors or splashes.
        metal:
          appearance: Fuel system varnish on metal appears as a dark brown or black,
            sticky, glossy film that can harden over time.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and uneven, varying from thin films
            in some areas to thick deposits in others.
          pattern: It often forms in streaks or patches, concentrating in areas with
            fuel flow stagnation or high temperatures.
        mineral:
          appearance: Varnish on minerals appears as dark, oily coatings that can
            obscure natural colors and create a sticky layer.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and variable, depending on mineral
            type and exposure duration.
          pattern: Distribution is in spots or thin films, concentrated on exposed
            surfaces in contact with fuel.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, it looks like a dark, oily coating that may cause
            discoloration and a slightly sticky texture.
          coverage: Coverage can be extensive and uniform in fuel-exposed parts, but
            uneven in others.
          pattern: It often forms in streaks or uniform layers, particularly on surfaces
            in constant contact with fuel.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, it manifests as a dark, swollen, or cracked film
            that can make the surface tacky and discolored.
          coverage: Coverage is often complete in fuel-contacted areas but patchy
            in less exposed regions.
          pattern: It typically forms in uniform layers or patches, especially in
            seals or hoses exposed to fuel.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, it manifests as microscopic, dark residues
            that can interfere with electrical properties and appear as faint films.
          coverage: Coverage is typically minimal but critical, varying from isolated
            spots to thin layers.
          pattern: It forms in uniform or speckled patterns, often due to contamination
            in manufacturing or fuel environments.
        specialty:
          appearance: For specialty materials, varnish appears as dark, adherent films
            tailored to the surface, such as on coatings or alloys.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, ranging from localized to extensive
            based on specific application and exposure.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material's properties, often in patches
            or uniform layers where fuel interacts.
        stone:
          appearance: Varnish on stone appears as dark, greasy spots or a dull film
            that can alter the natural color and texture.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and localized, with variations based
            on stone porosity and fuel contact.
          pattern: It forms in random spots or streaks, often where fuel has pooled
            or dripped onto the surface.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, it manifests as dark, oily stains that penetrate the
            grain, giving a wet, discolored look.
          coverage: Coverage can range from light spotting to extensive areas, depending
            on exposure and wood porosity.
          pattern: Distribution is usually in irregular patches or streaks, following
            the wood's natural grain and absorption patterns.

    description: Gasket remnants build up when old seals break down under heat or
      disassembly stress, softening into sticky patches that harden on metal surfaces.
      In practice, these bits stretch and tear unevenly with a flexible, layered texture,
      setting them apart from flaky oxidation, while fibers embed deeply and resist
      basic scrapes. On [steel](../materials/steel.md), they bond tightly and warp
      finishes, hampering tight tolerances; aluminum sees them smear into pores, weakening
      seals; cast iron traps them in rough spots, creating gritty debris. Removal
      turns out challenging, as they shrug off solvents and abrasives, leaving residues
      that compromise joints over time. Laser cleaning lines up well—it pulses energy
      to vaporize organic layers precisely, clearing contaminants across these materials
      without base damage, delivering a clean finish that helps parts hold up reliably.

            porosity and gasket contact points.
          pattern: It appears as isolated patches or smears, often concentrated in
            crevices or along seams, with irregular dispersal.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, residue looks like oily, dark stains that can penetrate
            the grain, appearing blotchy and discolored, often with a tacky feel.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and spotty, limited to where the
            gasket was applied, with variations in intensity.
          pattern: It tends to form blotches or patches, following the wood grain
            or areas of contact, with no uniform spread.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Gold electroplating manifests as a bright, gold layer that may
            look glossy or slightly textured, adhering to the glazed or unglazed surface.
          coverage: Coverage is typically complete and consistent on smooth surfaces,
            but may vary on rough or porous areas.
          pattern: It often forms a uniform coating, but can appear as spots or patches
            if the ceramic has uneven porosity.
        composite:
          appearance: Gold electroplating looks like a gold layer that may appear
            mottled or varied, reflecting the different materials in the composite.
          coverage: Coverage is generally partial and irregular, varying with the
            composition and surface properties.
          pattern: It tends to form an uneven pattern, with patches or streaks corresponding
            to the composite's heterogeneous structure.
        concrete:
          appearance: The contamination appears as a dull, gold-colored layer that
            may look speckled or rough, adhering poorly to the porous surface.
          coverage: Coverage is typically sparse and inconsistent, with large variations
            due to surface roughness.
          pattern: It forms patchy or streaky patterns, often following cracks or
            uneven areas in the concrete.
        fabric:
          appearance: Gold electroplating shows as a metallic gold sheen that can
            be stiff or flaky, often not integrating well with the fibrous material.
          coverage: Coverage is minimal and highly variable, usually limited to surface
            contact points.
          pattern: Distribution is irregular, forming patches or lines along the weave,
            with a tendency to flake off.
        glass:
          appearance: It appears as a reflective, gold-colored coating that can be
            transparent or opaque, giving a metallic sheen to the glass surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally even and full, though defects can cause
            localized thin or thick areas.
          pattern: The pattern is usually uniform if applied correctly, but may show
            streaks or bubbles if the process is flawed.
        metal:
          appearance: Gold electroplating appears as a bright, metallic yellow-gold
            layer with a smooth, shiny finish, often masking the underlying metal.
          coverage: Coverage is usually complete and consistent, with minimal variation,
            as it is intentionally applied to coat the entire surface.
          pattern: It typically forms a uniform, even coating across the surface,
            though it may show streaks or patches if applied unevenly.
        mineral:
          appearance: Gold electroplating manifests as a bright, gold coating that
            can enhance or obscure the mineral's natural luster and color.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely, from full on smooth surfaces to partial
            on rough or crystalline areas.
          pattern: Distribution is often uneven, with spots or uniform layers depending
            on the mineral's crystal structure and smoothness.
        plastic:
          appearance: The contamination appears as a thin, metallic gold film that
            can be shiny or prone to peeling, depending on the plastic type and surface
            treatment.
          coverage: Coverage is often full but can be inconsistent, with variations
            in thickness and adherence.
          pattern: Distribution is usually even if pre-treated, but may show blotches
            or uneven areas due to poor adhesion.
        rubber:
          appearance: It appears as a flaky or peeling gold coating that may not bond
            well, often looking dull or cracked on the flexible surface.
          coverage: Coverage is sparse and uneven, with poor adhesion leading to significant
            variation.
          pattern: The pattern is typically spotty or streaky, concentrating on raised
            areas or where the rubber is less elastic.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: It appears as a thin, conductive gold layer with a shiny, metallic
            finish, often used for electrical contacts in microelectronics.
          coverage: Coverage is highly controlled and localized, with minimal variation
            to ensure electrical performance.
          pattern: The pattern is precisely uniform and controlled, typically applied
            in specific areas like pads or traces without spreading.
        specialty:
          appearance: Gold electroplating looks variable, from glossy to textured,
            depending on the specialty material's unique properties and surface conditions.
          coverage: Coverage is customized and often inconsistent, designed to meet
            particular functional or aesthetic requirements.
          pattern: Distribution can range from uniform to highly irregular, tailored
            to the material's specific application and structure.
        stone:
          appearance: Gold electroplating shows as a shiny, gold layer that may appear
            speckled or dull, depending on the stone's texture and porosity.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and inconsistent, with variations
            based on surface irregularities.
          pattern: Distribution is often patchy or streaky, following the natural
            fissures and rough surfaces of the stone.
        wood:
          appearance: The contamination appears as a thin, metallic gold film that
            can look glossy or flaky, often not adhering well to the porous surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and uneven, with significant variation
            due to wood's absorbent nature.
          pattern: It tends to form irregular patches or spots, concentrating in grooves
            or damaged areas where the wood is more receptive.

    description: Graffiti paint stands out as a deliberate contaminant that bonds
      aggressively to urban surfaces like [Concrete](../materials/concrete.md), metal,
      and glass. Unlike natural dirt or bird droppings, it penetrates porous materials
      deeply, while forming slick layers on smooth ones, making removal tricky. Teams
      typically line up solvents or abrasives to strip it, yet it often leaves stains
      that hold up against basic cleaning.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Graffiti on ceramic surfaces displays bright colors with a glossy
            or satin finish, adhering well to the smooth glaze but potentially showing
            brush strokes or drips.
          coverage: Coverage is generally even and dense in applied areas, with little
            variation unless the surface is textured or damaged.
          pattern: It tends to form patches or uniform coatings, often in defined
            shapes or letters, with minimal spreading due to the non-porous surface.
        composite:
          appearance: Graffiti on composite materials appears as varied colors and
            textures, depending on the mix, often with a matte or glossy finish that
            highlights surface imperfections.
          coverage: Coverage is mixed, with some areas fully covered and others barely
            touched, leading to high variation based on surface composition.
          pattern: It forms irregular patches, streaks, or spots, distributed unevenly
            across the material due to its heterogeneous nature.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, graffiti looks bold and textured, with colors settling
            into pores and cracks, often appearing matte and rough due to the abrasive
            surface.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from light tagging to heavy layers, with variations
            in thickness where paint accumulates in low spots or wears unevenly.
          pattern: Distribution includes streaks, drips, and patches, commonly clustered
            on flat walls or corners, with paint filling surface irregularities.
        fabric:
          appearance: Graffiti on fabric appears as stained or absorbed colors, often
            with a soft, blurred texture that can spread into the fibers, creating
            a faded look.
          coverage: Coverage varies from small spots to large stained areas, with
            uneven saturation depending on fabric type and paint viscosity.
          pattern: It typically forms blotches, streaks, or patches, following the
            weave of the fabric and sometimes bleeding into surrounding areas.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, graffiti appears as vivid, translucent or opaque colors,
            often with a smooth, shiny finish that may include drips or smears if
            not cleaned quickly.
          coverage: Coverage is often complete in targeted areas, but can be patchy
            with variations in thickness, leading to easy visibility and removal challenges.
          pattern: Patterns are usually streaks, splatters, or uniform layers, sometimes
            forming words or images that stand out clearly against the transparent
            background.
        metal:
          appearance: Graffiti on metal often appears as bright, opaque colors with
            a glossy or matte finish, sometimes showing drips or uneven texture due
            to the smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage is usually partial, with variations from thin layers
            to thick, overlapping areas, depending on the application method.
          pattern: It typically forms streaks, drips, or patches, often concentrated
            in irregular shapes or along edges where spray paint accumulates.
        mineral:
          appearance: Graffiti on mineral surfaces displays vivid hues against the
            natural color and crystalline texture, often with a slight sheen or matte
            finish that may highlight mineral features.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and uneven, varying from thin coats
            to dense applications, influenced by the surface hardness and porosity.
          pattern: It forms spots, streaks, or patches, distributed in areas of easy
            access, with drips following the mineral's contours or cleavage planes.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, graffiti can look shiny or matte, with colors that
            may bead up or spread unevenly, sometimes peeling or cracking over time.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and inconsistent, varying from light
            coats to thicker layers that might flake off easily.
          pattern: Patterns include spots, streaks, or smears, often distributed in
            random patches where the paint does not adhere uniformly to the smooth
            surface.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, graffiti shows as muted or bright colors with a flexible,
            often cracked or peeling texture, as the paint may not bond well to the
            elastic surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light and patchy, with significant variation
            due to the material's movement and poor adhesion.
          pattern: Patterns are usually spots or smears, with a tendency to flake
            or rub off, resulting in fragmented distribution over time.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, graffiti appears as foreign, often colorful
            contaminants that contrast with the smooth, metallic or silicon surface,
            potentially causing visual defects.
          coverage: Coverage is minimal and localized, with high variation, as even
            small amounts can be problematic for functionality and require precise
            cleaning.
          pattern: Patterns are usually random spots or smears, distributed haphazardly
            due to the delicate nature, possibly affecting electronic properties if
            not removed.
        specialty:
          appearance: Graffiti on specialty materials varies widely, appearing as
            bright or dull colors with textures matching the surface, such as glossy
            on coated metals or matte on composites.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, from sparse to full, depending on
            the material's susceptibility and the graffiti artist's intent, often
            requiring specialized removal methods.
          pattern: Distribution is irregular, forming patches, streaks, or custom
            designs, adapted to the material's unique properties like flexibility
            or reflectivity.
        stone:
          appearance: Graffiti on stone shows up as bold colors against the natural
            texture, often with a matte or slightly glossy finish that can highlight
            surface irregularities.
          coverage: It ranges from sparse tagging to extensive coverage, with uneven
            areas where paint pools in crevices or wears off easily.
          pattern: Distribution includes spots, streaks, or large patches, frequently
            clustered on flat or accessible areas, with drips running down rough surfaces.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, graffiti can look vibrant or faded, with colors seeping
            into the grain, creating a rough or absorbent texture that may appear
            blotchy.
          coverage: Coverage varies widely, from light spatters to dense layers, with
            inconsistencies due to the porous nature of wood.
          pattern: It often appears as patches or streaks, following the wood grain
            or forming random spots where the paint adheres unevenly.

  grease-deposits:
    composition:
    - Mineral Oil
    - Lithium Soap
    - PTFE
    description: 'Operators apply grease to machinery parts, which cuts down friction
      effectively. In practice, heat and pressure break it down over time. Vibration
      speeds up the process and forms thick, sticky layers in high-load spots.


      These deposits stand out with their clingy grip and gritty texture from trapped
      metal bits. Thinner oil wipes off easily, yet grease clings hard. It traps more
      dirt and leaves a film that alters surfaces in unique ways.


      On [steel](../materials/steel.md), deposits harden into a tough coating that
      sets up rust if operators ignore it. [Iron](../materials/iron.md) picks up similar
      sticky buildup that embeds deep and resists basic wipes. [Aluminum](../materials/aluminum.md),
      being softer, lets grease smear unevenly. This dulls the finish and affects
      handling. Cast iron behaves much like steel. Contamination bonds tight there—wrong
      scraping even scratches it.


      Removing grease deposits runs into significant challenges that old methods struggle
      to clear. Solvents dissolve the oil base but leave gritty particles behind.
      This demands extra steps and raises worker risks. Scraping works out on flat
      steel, yet it damages curved aluminum and loses precision. Steam cleaning loosens
      layers on iron but fails against heat-resistant additives. It often leaves moisture
      issues. In most cases, these approaches drag out downtime without a clean finish.


      Laser cleaning lines up as a solid fix overall. It vaporizes the petroleum base
      fast while knocking off particles, all without harming the metal underneath.
      Testing shows it clears thick buildup on steel and aluminum equally well. Operators
      dial in settings to match deposit depth. This wraps up jobs quicker on cast
      iron and iron too. Essentially, this dry process skips added mess and delivers
      reliable results.'

    description: "Author: Alessandro Moretti, Ph.D. from Italy  \nTopic: Hydraulic-fluid\
      \ contamination  \n\nThis contamination, it arises from leaks in heavy machinery,\
      \ where petroleum-based oils seep out gradually. Influenced from vibration and\
      \ pressure, these fluids form sticky deposits that manifest as oily films. Over\
      \ time, the films harden, exhibiting a tenacity unlike dry dust or watery residues,\
      \ which wipe away easily.  \n\nThese contaminants, they distinguish themselves\
      \ by their persistent adhesion, penetrating surfaces rather than sitting loosely.\
      \ On [steel](../materials/steel.md), adhesion strengthens layers tenaciously,\
      \ building up slowly. [Aluminum](../materials/aluminum.md) shows quicker spread,\
      \ with films entering its pores deeply. Concrete absorbs them profoundly, leading\
      \ to darkened stains that persist.  \n\nRemoval challenges key, solvents prove\
      \ ineffective against embedded oils, while scraping risks surface damage. Mechanical\
      \ methods remain inefficient, as the tenacity resists casual efforts. It seems\
      \ that traditional approaches fail to address the hardened films without harm.\
      \  \n\nLaser cleaning excels precisely, its pulses vaporize contaminants effectively.\
      \ The process, it yields clean surfaces, leaving substrates unharmed, which\
      \ demonstrates superiority in handling such tenacious deposits."

    description: 'Industrial oil contamination, it arises in manufacturing environments
      where machinery lubricants degrade under friction and heat. This process, it
      forms sticky residues that adhere to operational surfaces during prolonged use,
      embedding deeply into contact zones.


      What distinguishes this oil from faster-evaporating solvents appears in its
      persistent hold; unlike those that dissipate quickly, it clings tenaciously,
      influenced from warmth and air exposure. The substance, it manifests a durable
      quality that penetrates bases, resisting weather impacts more robustly than
      transient variants.


      On metals, this contamination creates a resilient sheath that infiltrates microstructures,
      impairing function gradually over time. For porous materials, it develops thicker
      layers that reduce pliability, varying with surface properties and distributing
      unevenly across bases.


      Removal challenges stem mainly from the oily composition, which repels water-based
      agents and withstands strong solvents alike. Mechanical scrubbing proves inadequate,
      as the oil rebounds from applied force, leaving enduring residues that persist
      stubbornly.


      Laser cleaning demonstrates effectiveness by vaporizing the oil through selective
      light absorption, preserving underlying surfaces unharmed. This approach, it
      achieves thorough restoration that conventional methods cannot match, via precise
      thermal targeting that enhances accuracy.'

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, glossy film. Aged
            contamination becomes thicker, darker, and more matte. It often hardens
            and forms a crusty or gummy residue that is difficult to remove. The color
            darkens significantly, and the surface becomes rougher due to the accumulation
            of dirt and debris.
          buildup_progression: Buildup typically starts as a thin film at contact
            points or near the source of contamination. It then spreads outwards,
            often following edges and crevices. Over time, the film thickens and darkens
            due to oxidation and the accumulation of dirt and debris. Point sources
            expand outwards, and layering effects can occur with repeated contamination
            events. This process can take hours for a visible film to form, days for
            noticeable discoloration, and months for a significant buildup to develop.
          color_variations: Fresh contamination often appears as a translucent or
            light amber/honey color. As it ages and oxidizes, it darkens to shades
            of brownish-yellow, dark brown, and eventually black. In some cases, especially
            with metalworking fluids, a greenish-brown tint can be present due to
            the presence of dissolved metals.
          common_patterns: Oil and grease tend to accumulate in low-lying areas, crevices,
            and edges due to gravity and surface tension. Initial contamination often
            appears as localized spots or streaks near the source of the leak or application.
            Over time, these spots can coalesce and spread, forming a more uniform
            coating, especially on horizontal surfaces.
          concentration_variations: Concentration tends to be heavier at edges, corners,
            and in crevices where oil and grease can accumulate. Horizontal surfaces
            often have a more uniform coating than vertical surfaces, where gravity
            causes drips and runs. Exposed areas may have less buildup due to washing
            or wiping, while sheltered areas accumulate more.
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): barely visible sheen, very thin
            film. Light (10-30%): patchy distribution, thin layer, slight discoloration.
            Moderate (30-60%): noticeable coating, thicker layer, distinct discoloration.
            Heavy (60-85%): significant buildup, thick and sticky layer, dark color.
            Extreme (>85%): almost complete coverage, very thick crust, heavily soiled
            appearance.'
          description: Industrial oil and grease buildup on ceramic surfaces typically
            presents as a discolored, often darkened, coating that can range from
            a barely visible sheen to a thick, sticky layer. The color is usually
            darker than the original ceramic, and the texture varies from smooth and
            oily to rough and crusty depending on the age and type of contaminant.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common distribution patterns include: edge accumulation
            (along joints and seams), point source spreading (radiating outwards from
            a leak), gradient from source (decreasing concentration with distance),
            patchy/spotty (uneven distribution due to inconsistent application), streaky/linear
            (resulting from drips or runs), and localized concentrations (in crevices
            and corners).'
          edge_center_behavior: Industrial Oil / Grease Buildup preferentially accumulates
            at edges and in crevices on ceramic surfaces. This is due to surface tension
            effects, where the oil/grease is drawn to the edges and corners. The edges
            act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading further and leading
            to buildup. Center areas may have a thinner, more uniform coating, especially
            on horizontal surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Surface geometry significantly affects distribution. Oil
            and grease accumulate in corners and crevices due to surface tension and
            capillary action. Flat areas allow for pooling, while vertical surfaces
            promote dripping. Edges act as barriers, preventing the oil from spreading
            further and leading to buildup. Depressions and grooves fill up with the
            contaminant.
          gravity_influence: Gravity plays a significant role. Downward flow behavior
            is evident in drip marks and vertical streaking. Pooling occurs at bottom
            edges and on horizontal surfaces. Runs develop down slopes. Oil and grease
            can hang from overhead surfaces, forming droplets that eventually detach.
          lighting_effects: Under direct sunlight, fresh oil and grease can exhibit
            a slight sheen or gloss. Indoor fluorescent lighting may reveal subtle
            color variations and surface irregularities. Aged contamination tends
            to have a matte finish and absorbs light, making it appear darker and
            less reflective. Iridescence is rare but possible with very thin films.
          texture_details: The texture can range from smooth and oily when fresh,
            to sticky and tacky as it begins to dry, and eventually hard and crusty
            as it ages and oxidizes. Dust and debris often become embedded in the
            grease, creating a rough, sandpaper-like surface. At a microscopic level,
            the buildup may exhibit a layered or striated structure due to repeated
            applications and drying cycles.
          thickness_range: The thickness can range from a thin film of a few micrometers
            (µm) to a heavy buildup of several millimeters (mm). A light coating might
            be paper-thin, while a heavy buildup could be coin-thick or thicker in
            extreme cases.
          typical_formations: 'Typical formations include: drip marks (vertical streaks
            caused by gravity), runs/streaks (similar to drip marks but less defined),
            pools/puddles (on horizontal surfaces), thin films (early stages of contamination),
            thick crusts (aged, hardened buildup), discrete patches (isolated areas
            of contamination), spots/dots (small, localized deposits), and stains
            (discoloration of the ceramic surface).'
          uniformity_assessment: The distribution is typically moderately patchy to
            highly variable/irregular. Perfect uniformity is rare due to variations
            in surface roughness, application methods, and environmental factors.
            The non-uniformity is caused by the interplay of gravity, surface tension,
            and the viscosity of the oil/grease.
        composite:
          color_variations: Dark gray to black stains, brown discoloration, variations
            following fiber orientation and resin distribution
          common_patterns: Fiber-aligned streaks, resin-rich area darkening, edge
            wicking, and patchy distribution
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: isolated fiber darkening; Moderate: partial surface
            coverage with pattern emphasis; Heavy: extensive staining with deep wicking'
          description: Industrial oil and grease on composite materials appears as
            dark, irregular stains that highlight the underlying fiber structure and
            resin patterns. The contamination penetrates along fiber-matrix interfaces
            and can cause visible darkening of the composite surface. Laser cleaning
            requires understanding of the composite's layered structure and thermal
            properties.
          distribution_patterns: Follows fiber orientation, concentrates at edges
            and cut surfaces, spreads through capillary action along fibers
          edge_center_behavior: Strong preference for edges and cut surfaces where
            fibers are exposed
          geometry_effects: Enhanced along fiber directions, accumulates in woven
            patterns, follows composite layup geometry
          gravity_influence: Vertical wicking along fibers, pooling in resin-rich
            areas, downward migration
          texture_details: Uneven surface with contamination following fiber patterns;
            may show wicking along fiber directions
        concrete:
          color_variations: Dark gray to black, brownish tones from aged oil, variations
            following aggregate distribution
          common_patterns: Irregular blotches, drip trails, aggregate highlighting,
            and capillary rise patterns
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: surface spots; Moderate: connected patches with
            some penetration; Heavy: extensive darkening with deep subsurface contamination'
          description: Oil and grease contamination on concrete appears as dark, penetrating
            stains that highlight the porous aggregate structure and surface texture.
            The buildup creates deep, irregular patches that darken the cement matrix
            and can penetrate several millimeters. Laser cleaning must address both
            surface film and subsurface penetration in the porous concrete structure.
          distribution_patterns: Rapid penetration into pores, follows surface cracks
            and imperfections, spreads through capillary action
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and cracks where penetration is enhanced
          geometry_effects: Enhanced in textured surfaces, follows crack patterns,
            accumulates in joints and low spots
          gravity_influence: Vertical drip patterns, pooling in depressions, capillary
            rise from below
          texture_details: Dark, glossy patches on surface with deep penetration into
            pores; highlights aggregate boundaries
        fabric:
          color_variations: Dark brown to black stains, oil-ring patterns, variations
            following fabric dye and weave
          common_patterns: Concentric saturation rings, weave pattern emphasis, edge
            wicking, and contact transfer marks
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: isolated spots with minimal wicking; Moderate:
            connected stains with visible pattern; Heavy: extensive saturation with
            deep penetration'
          description: Industrial oil and grease on fabrics appear as dark, irregular
            stains that follow the weave pattern and create visible saturation rings.
            The contamination causes darkening of fibers and creates a greasy, matte
            appearance with potential for wicking along threads. Laser cleaning requires
            careful energy control to avoid fabric damage while removing embedded
            contamination.
          distribution_patterns: Rapid wicking along threads, follows weave direction,
            spreads through capillary action
          edge_center_behavior: Prefers edges and seams where wicking is enhanced
          geometry_effects: Enhanced along weave directions, follows fabric texture,
            accumulates in seams and folds
          gravity_influence: Downward wicking along vertical fabrics, pooling in folded
            areas
          texture_details: Greasy, matte surface with stiffened areas; shows fiber
            saturation and wicking patterns
        glass:
          color_variations: Rainbow interference colors, yellowish to brown translucent
            films, dark opaque areas in heavy buildup
          common_patterns: Uniform films, smeared streaks, fingerprint-like patterns,
            and concentric rings from droplet impacts
          coverage_ranges: 'Light: thin interference films; Moderate: partial opacity
            with visible streaks; Heavy: nearly opaque with thick accumulation'
          description: Industrial oil and grease on glass surfaces forms translucent
            to opaque films that create rainbow interference patterns and reduce transparency.
            The contamination appears as smeared layers with visible thickness variations,
            often showing Newton's rings under certain lighting conditions. Laser
            cleaning requires precise control to avoid thermal stress in the glass
            substrate.
          distribution_patterns: Forms continuous films, follows application or wiping
            directions, accumulates at edges
          edge_center_behavior: Tends to accumulate at edges and corners due to surface
            tension, but can form uniform films
          geometry_effects: Enhanced buildup in corners and recesses, follows surface
            curvature, accumulates around imperfections
          gravity_influence: Sagging and dripping on vertical surfaces, pooling at
            bottom edges, thinning on upper areas
          texture_details: Smooth, slippery surface with visible film thickness variations;
            shows interference patterns and light scattering
        metal:
          aged_appearance: Fresh contamination appears as a thin, often transparent
            film that is easily wiped away. Over time, it darkens in color, thickens,
            and becomes more viscous or solid. Aged contamination is often more difficult
            to remove, forming a hard, crusty layer that may require specialized cleaning
            methods. Oxidation and polymerization contribute to the hardening and
            darkening process.
          buildup_progression: 'Starts as a thin, often invisible film that gradually
            thickens over time. Begins at contact points (e.g., leaks, drips) and
            spreads outward. Accumulation is often faster at edges and in crevices.
            Layering effects can occur with repeated exposure. Seasonal variations
            in temperature and humidity can affect the rate of buildup and oxidation.
            Timeframes: Noticeable film within hours, visible buildup within days,
            significant crusting within months.'
          color_variations: 'Fresh: Translucent amber or light yellow. Mildly Aged:
            Light brown to tan. Moderately Aged: Medium to dark brown, sometimes with
            reddish hues due to rust staining. Heavily Aged: Dark brown to black,
            often with greenish or greyish tinges from oxidation or microbial growth.
            Heat-affected: Blueish-black or iridescent.'
          common_patterns: Drip marks on vertical surfaces, pooling in low-lying areas,
            accumulation in corners and crevices, and a general tendency to spread
            from the point of origin. Streaks and runs are common on inclined surfaces.
            Flat horizontal surfaces often exhibit a more uniform coating, while vertical
            surfaces show more pronounced gravitational effects.
          concentration_variations: 'Heavy concentration: Corners, crevices, low-lying
            areas, and areas directly below the source of contamination. Light concentration:
            Elevated surfaces, areas exposed to airflow, and areas that have been
            partially cleaned. Vertical surfaces tend to have a gradient from top
            (lighter) to bottom (heavier) due to gravity.'
          coverage_ranges: 'Sparse (<10% coverage): Isolated spots or streaks, barely
            visible film. Light (10-30%): Thin, patchy coating, easily wiped away.
            Moderate (30-60%): Visible coating, some areas still clean, requires more
            effort to remove. Heavy (60-85%): Thick, continuous coating, difficult
            to remove. Extreme (>85%): Very thick, encrusted layer, may obscure the
            underlying surface features.'
          description: Industrial oil and grease buildup on metal surfaces typically
            presents as a discolored, often glossy or matte coating that can range
            from a barely perceptible film to a thick, crusty layer. The color varies
            depending on the type of oil/grease, contaminants present, and age, but
            generally progresses from light to dark shades. Coverage patterns are
            highly variable, influenced by gravity, surface geometry, and the source
            of contamination.
          distribution_patterns: 'Common patterns include: Point source spreading
            (radial pattern from a leak), Streaky/linear (from dripping or wiping),
            Edge accumulation (due to surface tension), Gradient from source (decreasing
            thickness with distance), Patchy/spotty (uneven application or removal),
            and Uniform coating (rare, but possible with intentional application).'
          edge_center_behavior: Preferentially accumulates at edges and in corners
            due to surface tension. The oil/grease tends to 'wick' towards the edges,
            creating a visible line or buildup. Center areas may have a thinner, more
            uniform coating, especially on flat surfaces.
          geometry_effects: Accumulates in corners and crevices due to surface tension
            and capillary action. Pools on flat areas, especially horizontal surfaces.
            Drips on vertical surfaces, creating streaks. Collects at edges, forming
            a visible line. Follows contours of the surface, accentuating imperfections.
            Fills depressions and small holes.
          gravity_influence: Strong downward flow behavior on vertical and inclined
            surfaces. Pooling at bottom edges and in low-lying areas. Drip marks from
            top to bottom. Vertical streaking is a common manifestation of gravitational
            effects. Settling on horizontal surfaces, creating a more uniform coating.
          lighting_effects: Fresh oil/grease often exhibits a glossy or wet appearance
            under direct lighting, reflecting light specularly. As it ages and oxidizes,
            the surface becomes more matte and absorbs more light. Iridescence or
            rainbow effects can be observed in thin films due to interference. Under
            fluorescent lighting, the color may appear slightly different compared
            to sunlight.
          texture_details: 'Fresh: Slippery, oily, and smooth to the touch. Mildly
            Aged: Slightly sticky or tacky. Moderately Aged: Greasy, waxy, or slightly
            crusty. Heavily Aged: Hard, crusty, gummy, or tar-like. May contain embedded
            particulate matter, creating a rough surface. Can also be powdery if the
            oil has dried and oxidized.'
          thickness_range: 'Thin film: 0.1 - 10 micrometers. Moderate buildup: 10
            - 100 micrometers. Heavy buildup: 100 micrometers - 1 millimeter. Extreme
            buildup: > 1 millimeter (coin-thick or greater).'
          typical_formations: Drip marks, runs/streaks, pools/puddles, thin films,
            thick crusts, discrete patches, spots/dots, stains, and buildups are all
            common. The specific formation depends on the viscosity of the oil/grease,
            the surface orientation, and the environmental conditions. Thick crusts
            form from repeated exposure and oxidation.
          uniformity_assessment: Highly variable/irregular. The distribution is rarely
            perfectly uniform due to variations in surface roughness, temperature

            substrate damage'
          description: Oil and grease contamination on plastics appears as glossy,
            wet-looking patches that can cause surface crazing or chemical etching
            over time. The buildup creates visible discoloration and may lead to stress
            cracking in some polymer types. Laser cleaning must consider the plastic's
            thermal sensitivity and potential for surface degradation.
          distribution_patterns: Spreads along surface imperfections, concentrates
            at stress points, follows manufacturing marks

      bodies. It forms through impacts during motion of structures, where flying insects
      collide and smear across surfaces, then dry under air and heat exposure, thus
      creating hardened adhesive layers over time.


      Unique characteristics of this residue, they include irregular splatters with
      yellowish hues and fibrous textures. This contamination distinguishes from dirt
      or pollen by sticky organic composition and biological resilience, while mineral
      dusts lack such adhesion and toughness.


      Behavior on glass surfaces like float glass or borosilicate glass, residue adheres
      tightly and etches lightly under sunlight. On metals such as aluminum or stainless
      steel, surface dulls from the deposit, particles trap in pores, thus leading
      to persistent buildup. After exposure, contamination still persists on tempered
      glass, while on copper it causes slight discoloration.


      Key challenges for removal arise from bonding strength of the residue. It resists
      solvents and scraping, mechanical methods spread contamination further, traditional
      cleaners fail against hardened proteins, thus risking surface scratches.


      Laser cleaning proves effective, pulses vaporize organics precisely without
      abrasion. Energy targets residue selectively, underlying materials like borosilicate
      glass or stainless steel remain intact, after treatment surfaces already exhibit
      cleanliness with no secondary damage. This method, it removes layers and restores
      uniformity.'

            in thermoplastics under high heat.
        rubber:
          appearance: Appears as darkened or burnt areas with a rough, cracked texture,
            sometimes accompanied by smoke residues.
          coverage: Coverage is generally localized but can spread unevenly, depending
            on rubber hardness and additives.
          pattern: Usually forms spots or streaks that may coalesce into larger patches
            under excessive laser exposure.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: Appears as subtle discoloration or oxidation with a smooth,
            sometimes hazy finish, often in gray or brown shades.
          coverage: Coverage is generally minimal and controlled, but can vary with
            surface defects and doping levels.
          pattern: Usually forms precise, uniform patterns in controlled processes,
            but contamination can cause spots or streaks.
        specialty:
          appearance: Varies widely; may show unique color shifts or textures, such
            as iridescence on coatings or charring on biomaterials.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable and material-dependent, ranging from
            uniform to sparse based on application and impurities.
          pattern: Patterns depend on material specifics, often irregular or custom-designed,
            but can include spots or patches.
        stone:
          appearance: Manifests as faded or darkened spots with a matte or crystalline
            texture, depending on the stone type and impurities.
          coverage: Coverage is typically sparse and irregular, influenced by stone
            porosity and laser intensity.
          pattern: Can form spots or uniform areas, but often appears patchy due to
            natural variations in mineral composition.
        wood:
          appearance: Shows as darkened or charred areas with a rough, burnt texture,
            sometimes with lighter shades if the wood resin reacts.
          coverage: Coverage is generally partial and uneven, varying with wood density
            and moisture content, rarely uniform.
          pattern: Often appears as streaks or patches that follow the wood grain,
            leading to irregular distributions.

    visual_characteristics:
      appearance_on_categories:
        ceramic:
          appearance: Lead paint on ceramic surfaces appears as a hard, glossy coating
            in bright colors, possibly with a cracked or crazed texture from firing
            or aging.
          coverage: It often covers the entire surface evenly, though variations occur
            in handmade items, with some areas more densely painted than others.
          pattern: Distribution is typically uniform for decorative purposes, but
            may show brush strokes, spots, or patches if hand-applied, with potential
            flaking.
        composite:
          appearance: Lead paint on composites appears as a cohesive layer in assorted
            colors, with a texture matching the substrate, and may show cracking or
            delamination.
          coverage: Coverage varies from full to partial, depending on application;
            it may be uneven due to material heterogeneity and adhesion issues.
          pattern: Distribution is often uniform but can be streaky or patchy, following
            the composite's irregular surface and potentially flaking at joints.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, lead paint presents as a thick, matte or semi-gloss
            coating in colors like gray or yellow, with a rough texture from the surface
            and potential cracking or peeling.
          coverage: Coverage is generally full on smooth surfaces but spotty on rough
            concrete, with variations due to application and environmental exposure.
          pattern: It often appears uniform but can show brush marks, drips, or patchy
            areas where it has degraded or been removed, following concrete pores.
        fabric:
          appearance: Lead paint on fabric appears as a stiff, colored layer in hues
            such as blue or green, with a rough, crusty texture that may flake or
            powder off.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial and inconsistent, often limited
            to specific areas like prints or borders, with bare fabric visible elsewhere.
          pattern: Distribution is usually uneven, forming spots, streaks, or patches
            where applied, and it can bleed into fibers or cluster in designs.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, lead paint is rare but may appear as a thin, translucent
            or opaque film in colors like black or white, often with a smooth, adhered
            finish.
          coverage: Coverage is generally minimal and localized, such as on window
            frames or decorative elements, and is often incomplete or easily removed.
          pattern: It usually forms a uniform layer if present, but can show brush
            marks, drips, or be confined to edges or designs, with minimal flaking.
        metal:
          appearance: Lead-based paint on metal often appears as a thick, glossy or
            matte coating in colors like white, red, or yellow, with potential chalking
            or flaking over time.
          coverage: Coverage is usually complete and consistent, though it may vary
            with wear, corrosion, or removal attempts, leaving exposed spots.
          pattern: It typically forms a uniform layer but can show streaks, drips,
            or patchy areas where it has peeled or been applied unevenly.
        mineral:
          appearance: Lead paint on mineral surfaces looks like an adherent, opaque
            layer in various colors, with a finish that may be smooth or granular,
            and can show chipping or discoloration.
          coverage: Coverage varies from complete to partial, often uneven on crystalline
            or rough minerals, with gaps where paint did not adhere.
          pattern: Distribution is typically uniform or in patches, with streaks from
            application, and it may flake off along mineral cleavage planes.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, lead paint manifests as a thin, often flexible layer
            in various colors, with a smooth or slightly textured finish that may
            peel or chip.
          coverage: Coverage is generally complete initially but becomes inconsistent
            with wear, exposing the plastic substrate in spots.
          pattern: It usually forms a uniform coat but can exhibit drips, streaks,
            or patchiness due to poor adhesion, leading to flaking in high-stress
            areas.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, lead paint looks like a flexible, sometimes glossy
            coating in colors like black or red, with a tendency to crack, peel, or
            rub off easily.
          coverage: Coverage is often incomplete and variable, thinning in high-flex
            areas and leaving exposed rubber, especially with movement.
          pattern: It typically forms a uniform layer but may show streaks, smudges,
            or patchy areas where it has worn away or not adhered well.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, lead paint is uncommon but may appear as
            a thin, precise coating in specific colors, with a smooth, integrated
            finish for protection or marking.
          coverage: Coverage is typically minimal and highly uniform, limited to designated
            areas for functional purposes, with little variation.
          pattern: It usually forms uniform, controlled layers or precise patterns
            like lines or dots, with minimal streaking or flaking due to high-tech
            application.
        specialty:
          appearance: Lead paint on specialty materials varies widely but generally
            appears as a custom-colored, adherent layer with textures matching the
            substrate, prone to unique degradation like peeling or fading.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, ranging from full to selective, tailored
            to the specialty use, with inconsistencies based on material properties
            and application methods.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material; it can be uniform, patterned,
            or patchy, often designed for specific applications with streaks or spots
            from handwork.
        stone:
          appearance: Lead paint on stone looks like a dense, opaque layer in various
            colors, potentially with a rough texture from the stone's surface, and
            may show efflorescence or peeling.
          coverage: Coverage is typically partial to full, varying based on application;
            it may be spotty on rough stone, with gaps in coverage.
          pattern: It often appears as a uniform coat or in patches where applied,
            with streaks or drips from application, and can flake off in sections.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, lead paint presents as a solid, often cracked or alligatored
            finish in hues such as white, green, or brown, with a possible chalky
            residue.
          coverage: It commonly covers large surfaces fully, but deterioration leads
            to uneven coverage with bare wood showing through in areas.
          pattern: Distribution is generally uniform initially but becomes patchy
            or blistered with age, following the wood grain or forming irregular flakes.

        ceramic:
          appearance: Limescale on ceramic surfaces shows as white, chalky residues
            that can create a dull, rough finish on otherwise smooth tiles.
          coverage: Coverage is usually localized and uneven, with heavier deposits
            in high-splash zones and lighter elsewhere.
          pattern: It typically appears in spots, rings, or patches, often around
            drains, faucets, or where water pools.
        composite:
          appearance: Limescale on composites appears as white, crusty or powdery
            spots that can blend with or stand out from the varied surface textures.
          coverage: Coverage is typically sparse and uneven, with buildup in crevices
            or areas prone to water retention.
          pattern: It distributes in irregular spots or patches, influenced by the
            material's porosity and water contact points.
        concrete:
          appearance: On concrete, limescale deposits are white, powdery or crystalline
            efflorescence that can cover large areas and feel rough.
          coverage: Coverage can range from light dusting to heavy encrustation, varying
            with porosity and environmental conditions.
          pattern: They often form in patches, streaks, or a uniform layer, especially
            on surfaces exposed to groundwater or moisture.
        fabric:
          appearance: Limescale on fabric appears as stiff, white or grayish stains
            that can feel crusty and alter the texture of the fibers.
          coverage: Coverage is generally limited to affected areas, with patchy distribution
            depending on fabric absorbency and water contact.
          pattern: It typically shows as spots or streaks, following water spill or
            drip patterns, and may spread if not treated.
        glass:
          appearance: On glass, limescale appears as a cloudy, white film or spots
            that reduce transparency and can feel gritty.
          coverage: Coverage ranges from light spotting to a dense film, with more
            buildup in areas of frequent water contact.
          pattern: It often forms in spots, streaks, or a uniform haze, particularly
            around edges or where water droplets dry.
        metal:
          appearance: Limescale appears as a white, chalky, or crusty deposit that
            can feel rough and dull the metallic shine.
          coverage: Coverage is typically patchy and localized, varying from light
            dusting to thick buildup in high-mineral water areas.
          pattern: It often forms in spots or streaks, particularly around joints,
            edges, or areas with water exposure.
        mineral:
          appearance: Limescale on mineral surfaces appears as white, crystalline
            or chalky coatings that may mimic or obscure the natural mineral features.
          coverage: Coverage is highly variable, from sparse spots to extensive coatings,
            influenced by mineral composition and water flow.
          pattern: It forms in patches, veins, or uniform layers, often in fissures
            or on surfaces with water interaction.
        plastic:
          appearance: On plastic, limescale manifests as white, powdery or flaky deposits
            that may adhere loosely to the smooth surface.
          coverage: Coverage is generally light to moderate and patchy, with variations
            based on water exposure and plastic type.
          pattern: It forms in spots, streaks, or thin layers, commonly in areas exposed
            to hard water splashes or condensation.
        rubber:
          appearance: On rubber, limescale looks like white, chalky residues that
            may flake off or embed in the flexible, textured surface.
          coverage: Coverage is usually light and localized, varying with water exposure
            and the rubber's resistance to mineral adhesion.
          pattern: It often forms in spots or thin layers, particularly in seams or
            where water collects and evaporates.
        semiconductor:
          appearance: On semiconductors, limescale shows as microscopic white residues
            that can interfere with electronic properties and appear under magnification.
          coverage: Coverage is usually minimal and targeted, with critical implications
            for device performance even at low levels.
          pattern: It typically forms in localized spots or thin films, often in areas
            exposed to process water or contaminants.
        specialty:
          appearance: Limescale on specialty materials varies but generally appears
            as white, adherent deposits that can degrade unique surface finishes.
          coverage: Coverage is material-specific, ranging from isolated spots to
            widespread films, tailored to the surface's exposure and composition.
          pattern: Distribution depends on the material's properties, often forming
            in spots or layers where water is present.
        stone:
          appearance: Limescale deposits on stone are white or off-white, crusty formations
            that can obscure the natural texture and color.
          coverage: Coverage varies from light veining to extensive crusting, depending
            on water mineral content and surface porosity.
          pattern: They form in patches, streaks, or efflorescence patterns, especially
            in joints or on surfaces with water flow.
        wood:
          appearance: On wood, limescale looks like white or grayish powdery or crystalline
            spots that can penetrate porous surfaces.
          coverage: Coverage is generally sparse and uneven, concentrated where water
            has evaporated, with minimal spread.
          pattern: It usually appears as scattered spots or patches, often following
            water drip lines or pooling areas.

    description: Sticky films from chlorine and quaternary ammonium residues build
      up on surfaces during repeated hospital cleanings. These contaminants form tight
      chemical bonds that resist water rinsing, clinging stubbornly unlike particulate
