    standard: "ASTM B187 (Bars, Rods, Shapes), ASTM B152 (Sheet, Plate), ASTM B5 (Wire), UNS C11000"
    composition: "99.90% Cu minimum, 0.04% oxygen (phosphorus not intentionally added); high electrical conductivity"
    common_names: "ETP Copper, Tough Pitch Copper"
    applications: "Electrical wiring, busbars, transformers, plumbing pipes, heat exchangers"
    key_properties: "Higher oxygen content than OFHC (reduces conductivity slightly to 97-101% IACS vs 100-102% for OFE); excellent ductility and formability; lower purity leads to minor embrittlement risk in hydrogen atmospheres compared to oxygen-free variants"
    laser_cleaning: "High reflectivity in IR wavelengths (requires green or UV lasers for better absorption); high thermal conductivity dissipates heat quickly, necessitating higher pulse energies or shorter pulses to avoid substrate melting; easier for surface oxides but harder for deep contaminants due to rapid heat diffusion"
