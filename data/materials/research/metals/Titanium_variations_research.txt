      99.0%+ Ti with very low interstitials (O ≤ 0.18%, Fe ≤ 0.20%, C ≤ 0.08%, N ≤ 0.03%, H ≤ 0.015%);
      highest purity among CP grades, excellent corrosion resistance, high ductility
    common_names_trade_names: CP Ti Grade 1, Unalloyed Titanium Grade 1
    primary_applications: Chemical processing equipment, medical implants (non-load bearing), desalination plants, anodizing applications
    key_properties_differ_from_base: Higher ductility and formability than higher grades; lower strength (yield ~240 MPa) but superior corrosion resistance in reducing acids compared to pure Ti (which is hypothetical 100% Ti); more forgiving in welding
    laser_cleaning_implications: Easier due to high purity and thin passive oxide layer; standard Nd:YAG or fiber laser parameters (1064 nm, pulse energy 1-10 mJ, fluence 1-5 J/cm²) suffice; minimal risk of subsurface heating or embrittlement
