stainless_steel_variations:
  - designation_name: "304"
    standard_specification: "ASTM A240/A240M, AISI 304, UNS S30400"
    composition_characteristics: "Iron-based alloy with 18-20% Cr, 8-10.5% Ni, ≤0.08% C, ≤2% Mn, ≤0.75% Si; austenitic structure, non-magnetic, excellent corrosion resistance in mild environments."
    common_names_trade_names: "18/8 stainless, surgical stainless"
    primary_applications: "Food processing equipment, kitchen utensils, architectural panels, chemical containers"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Superior corrosion resistance and formability compared to carbon steels; good ductility and weldability; lower strength than martensitic grades but higher than ferritic."
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier due to stable passive oxide layer; standard Nd:YAG or fiber laser parameters (1064 nm, 1-10 J/cm² fluence) work well; minimal risk of surface discoloration if power is controlled to avoid overheating the Cr-rich layer."
  
  - designation_name: "304L"
    standard_specification: "ASTM A240/A240M, AISI 304L, UNS S30403"
