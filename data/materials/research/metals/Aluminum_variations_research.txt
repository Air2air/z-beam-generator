variations:
  - name: "1050-O"
    standard: "AA 1050-O (Aluminum Association), ASTM B209M, EN AW-1050A"
    composition: "Commercially pure aluminum (99.5% Al min), with trace Fe, Si; annealed (O) temper for soft, ductile state"
    common_names: "EC (Electrolytic Conductor) grade, Soft Aluminum"
    primary_applications: "Electrical conductors, chemical processing equipment, foil, heat exchangers"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Higher purity than industrial base Al (99.7%+); excellent corrosion resistance and thermal conductivity; lower strength (yield ~25 MPa) but higher ductility and formability compared to alloyed Al"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier due to soft surface and minimal alloying; low reflectivity in visible-IR lasers allows efficient oxide removal at lower fluences (~1-2 J/cm²); minimal risk of subsurface damage, but requires pulse control to avoid melting pure Al (melting point ~660°C)"

  - name: "1100-H14"
    standard: "AA 1100-H14, ASTM B209, UNS A91100"
    composition: "99.0% Al min, 0.05-0.20% Cu, trace others; strain-hardened (H14: half-hard) temper"
    common_names: "Commercial purity Aluminum, Sheet Aluminum"
    primary_applications: "General sheet metal work, utensils, heat reflectors, license plates"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Slight Cu addition improves strength (yield ~95 MPa) over pure Al while retaining good corrosion resistance and workability; moderate formability"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Similar to pure Al, relatively easy; H14 temper adds slight hardness, requiring slightly higher fluences (~2-3 J/cm²) for contaminant removal without deforming surface; good for pulsed fiber lasers (1064 nm) due to consistent reflectivity"

  - name: "2024-T3"
    standard: "AA 2024-T3, ASTM B211, AMS 4080 (aerospace spec)"
    composition: "4.4% Cu, 1.5% Mg, 0.6% Mn, balance Al; solution heat-treated and cold-worked (T3) temper"
    common_names: "Duralumin variant, High-strength Aerospace Aluminum"
    primary_applications: "Aircraft structures, truck frames, rivets, high-stress components"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "High strength (yield ~345 MPa) and fatigue resistance from Cu/Mg; lower corrosion resistance than pure Al, often clad; good machinability but susceptible to stress corrosion"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Harder due to temper and alloys; requires higher energy densities (~3-5 J/cm²) and shorter pulses to avoid cracking or altering heat-affected zone; Cu content increases absorption at certain wavelengths, making cleaning more efficient but risking selective melting"

  - name: "3003-H18"
    standard: "AA 3003-H18, ASTM B209, EN AW-3003"

    common_names: "Marine Grade Aluminum, Sheet Alloy"
    primary_applications: "Marine hardware, fuel tanks, appliances, pressure vessels"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Mg/Cr provide good strength (yield ~193 MPa) and superior corrosion resistance (especially saltwater); excellent weldability and fatigue strength over pure Al"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier for corrosion-prone surfaces; Mg aids in oxide layer removal at lower fluences (~1.5-3 J/cm²) due to altered reflectivity; however, Cr may cause uneven cleaning, necessitating scanning patterns to avoid pitting"

    laser_cleaning_implications: "Balanced; T6 hardness requires moderate fluences (~2-4 J/cm²) with Q-switched lasers to cleanly remove contaminants without softening the temper; Si content improves laser absorption, easing cleaning but increasing risk of microcracks if overpowered"

  - name: "6063-T6"
    standard: "AA 6063-T6, ASTM B221, EN AW-6063"
    composition: "0.7% Mg, 0.4% Si, balance Al; T6 temper (solution treated and aged)"
    common_names: "Architectural Aluminum, Anodizing Grade"
    primary_applications: "Window frames, doors, piping, anodized trim"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Similar to 6061 but optimized for extrusion and finishing; yield ~214 MPa, excellent surface finish and corrosion resistance after anodizing; lower strength but better formability"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier for anodized surfaces; smooth extrusion finish allows precise cleaning at low fluences (~1-2.5 J/cm²); Mg-Si aids uniform ablation, but pre-anodizing requires care to avoid altering oxide layer adhesion"

    common_names: "Sand Cast Aluminum, Automotive Casting Alloy"
    primary_applications: "Engine blocks, wheels, pump housings, aerospace castings"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Si improves castability and wear resistance; T6 provides good strength (yield ~165 MPa) and ductility; better fluidity than wrought pure Al but with porosity risks"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Moderate to harder due to casting porosity/surface roughness; requires higher pulse energies (~3-5 J/cm²) to penetrate irregularities; Si enhances ablation efficiency but may cause uneven cleaning on rough surfaces, needing multi-pass scans"

  - name: "A380 (Cast)"
    standard: "AA A380, ASTM B85, UNS A03800 (die casting)"

    laser_cleaning_implications: "Challenging on die-cast surfaces with release agents; Cu/Si increase absorption, allowing cleaning at ~2.5-4 J/cm², but porosity can trap contaminants, requiring defocused beams or higher repetition rates to avoid melt pools"

  - name: "1100 (Pure, General)"
    standard: "AA 1100 (various tempers), ASTM B233 (wire), ISO 209"
