          Marble, primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), is a porous, calcareous stone commonly used in cultural
          heritage artifacts (e.g., sculptures, historical facades), construction, and architectural elements. Laser cleaning
          of marble focuses on removing contaminants like soot, graffiti, biological growth, or coatings while preserving
          the stone''s delicate structure. Marble has low thermal conductivity and is prone to thermal cracking or discol'
