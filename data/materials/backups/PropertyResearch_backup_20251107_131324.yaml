          property: density

          description: Mass per unit volume of the material

          relevance: Affects thermal mass and energy distribution during cleaning

          laser_cleaning_impact: Influences heat diffusion rates and required energy density in wood substrates; lower density
          woods like maple may require adjusted laser parameters to avoid charring or uneven heating due to rapid heat diffusion
          in porous structures

          laser_cleaning_impact: Influences heat diffusion rates and required energy density; higher density increases thermal
          inertia, requiring higher laser energy for effective ablation without excessive heating, while variations due to
          mineral composition (e.g., quartz vs. feldspar content) can alter local heat distribution an'
