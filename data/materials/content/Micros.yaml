  Vanadium:
    before: Microscopic examination reveals widespread contamination on the vanadium surface, particularly from oxide layers and particulate debris due to chemical processing exposure. Notably, dark irregular patches cluster unevenly, inducing pitting and micro-cracks that roughen the texture. Thus, this degradation undermines the metal's integrity for aerospace and nuclear applications, fostering further corrosion while impairing precision in critical settings.
    after: Following laser cleaning, the vanadium surface appears smooth and uniform, particularly free from oxides and residues. This process revives its inherent metallic sheen while preserving essential traits like high strength and heat resistance. Notably, no thermal distortion or weakening occurs, thus safeguarding full integrity for applications in aerospace, nuclear energy, and chemical processing. In essence, the restoration delivers precise, dependable results.

  Yttrium:
    before: Under the microscope, the yttrium surface straightforwardly displays very severe contamination, with fine particles adhering tightly to create uneven layers. Contaminants manifest as dark specks and oily films, likely residues from electronics or magnet manufacturing, which block optical clarity. Surface degradation appears in small pits and cracks; this process weakens the material and reduces smoothness, so practical cleaning proves essential for applications.
    after: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the yttrium surface turns straightforward smooth and clean, free from contaminants. This process removes residues efficiently while restoring the original luster, ensuring material integrity remains intact without thermal damage or cracks. Restoration quality stays high, preserving rare-earth properties for electronics and optics applications. The surface condition enables reliable performance in manufacturing.

  Zinc:
    before: Microscopic examination of the zinc surface discloses contamination by clustered dark particles and hazy films. Notably, these contaminants—likely oxides and processing residues—adhere unevenly, thus fostering pitting that undermines the metal's integrity in automotive and die casting applications.
    after: Following laser cleaning, the zinc surface becomes smooth and uniform, particularly free from oxides, dirt, and residues that accumulate on automotive or construction parts. This approach revives the metal's natural shine and texture, avoiding pitting or discoloration entirely. High restoration quality upholds zinc's integrity—its ductility and corrosion resistance remain fully intact for dependable die casting uses. Thus, it yields a clean, ready-to-use surface.
