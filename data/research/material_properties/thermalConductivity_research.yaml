      \ (27\xB0C). This is an extremely close match to the value being verified.\n\

      Thermal Properties\")**: The CRC Handbook provides a thermal conductivity range\
      \ for \"Borosilicate glass (Pyrex)\" of **1.13 W/m\xB7K** at 90\xB0C and **1.18\
      \ W/m\xB7K** at 300\xB0C. The value at 90\xB0C is an exact match, and the slight\

    ai_response: "Based on a review of authoritative sources, the provided thermal\
      \ conductivity value for ash wood requires verification and correction.\n\n\
      **1. Research Findings:**\nThe thermal conductivity of wood is not a single,\
      \ fixed value. It is highly dependent on factors such as:\n*   **Density:**\
      \ Higher density woods generally have higher thermal conductivity.\n*   **Moisture\
      \ Content (MC):** This is the most significant factor. Water (k ~0.6 W/m\xB7\
      K) is a much better conductor than dry wood cell walls, so thermal conductivity\
      \ increases substantially with MC.\n*   **Direction:** Thermal conductivity\
      \ along the grain (longitudinal) is approximately 2-2.8 times greater than across\
      \ the grain (radial or tangential).\n\nThe value of 0.16 W/m\xB7K is plausible\
      \ for a specific condition of ash wood, but it is not a general-purpose value.\n\
      \n**2. Authoritative References:**\n*   **Reference 1 (ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals):**\
      \ This is a primary reference for building science and material properties.\
      \ It provides detailed calculations for the thermal conductivity of wood based\
      \ on density and moisture content. For a wood with a typical density for ash\
      \ (approx. 680 kg/m\xB3) at 12% moisture content, the calculated conductivity\
      \ is approximately **0.11 W/m\xB7K**.\n*   **Reference 2 (Wood Handbook - USDA\
      \ Forest Service):** This is a definitive guide from the US Forest Products\
      \ Laboratory. Table 4-3 in the 2010 edition lists the thermal conductivity of\
      \ various woods at 12% MC. For white ash, a common species, it gives a value\
      \ of **0.11 W/m\xB7K** (across the grain).\n\n**3. Comparison with Current Value:**\n\
      The current value of 0.16 W/m\xB7K is approximately 45% higher than the standard\
      \ reference values for ash at 12% moisture content. The value of 0.16 W/m\xB7\
      K would be more representative of ash wood at a very high moisture content (likely\
      \ above 40-50%), or if it were measured along the grain.\n\n**4. Verified Value\
      \ and Confidence:**\nGiven that most engineering applications for wood properties\
      \ assume a standard moisture content (often 12%), the verified value should\
      \ reflect this common condition.\n\nVERIFIED_VALUE: 0.11 W/m\xB7K\nCONFIDENCE:\
