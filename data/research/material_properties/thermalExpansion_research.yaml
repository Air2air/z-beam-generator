      \ to -0.7 \u03BCm/m\xB7K**. This is due to the negative axial CTE of the carbon\

      \ by the positive CTE of the polymer matrix and is much higher, typically in\
      \ the range of **25 to 40 \u03BCm/m\xB7K**.\n*   **Reference 2 (NIST Publications\

      REASONING: The linear coefficient of thermal expansion for granite is not a
      single fixed value but falls within a typical range due to variations in mineral
      composition (quartz, feldspar, mica content). The reported value of 8.0 x 10^-6/K
      is the well-established mean value for common granite and sits squarely within
      the authoritative reference ranges of 7-9 x 10^-6/K (CRC) and 6.8-9.2 x 10^-6/K
      (ASM).

      \ the thermal expansion of hickory appears to be significantly inaccurate.\n\
      \n**1. Research Findings:**\nHickory, as a natural material (wood), has a thermal\
      \ expansion coefficient that is highly anisotropic (different along different\
      \ grain directions). The value is also highly dependent on its moisture content.\
      \ For wood at typical in-service moisture levels (~8-12%), the thermal expansion\
      \ parallel to the grain is very low, while it is much higher perpendicular to\
      \ the grain. The provided value of 33.7 \u03BCm/m\xB7K is not consistent with\
      \ published data for any direction.\n\n**2. Authoritative References:**\n* \
      \  **Wood Handbook (USDA Forest Service, FPL-GTR-190):** This is the primary\
      \ reference for wood properties. It states that the linear thermal expansion\
      \ coefficients for wood parallel to the grain are on the order of 3-5 \u03BC\
      m/m\xB7K. For hardwoods like hickory, a typical value is approximately **3.7\
      \ \u03BCm/m\xB7K** parallel to the grain.\n*   **CRC Handbook of Chemistry and\
      \ Physics:** Section 14 provides material properties, including for wood. It\
      \ corroborates the data from the Wood Handbook, listing thermal expansion coefficients\
      \ for wood parallel to the grain within the range of 2-6 \u03BCm/m\xB7K, consistent\
      \ with the more specific value for hickory.\n\n**3. Comparison with Current\
      \ Value:**\nThe current value of 33.7 \u03BCm/m\xB7K is an order of magnitude\
      \ (approximately 9 times) larger than the verified value for expansion parallel\
      \ to the grain. It is possible this value was mistakenly recorded for a different\
      \ material, a different property (such as moisture expansion), or for the perpendicular-to-grain\
      \ direction, though 33.7 \u03BCm/m\xB7K is still high for that case.\n\n**4.\
      \ Verified Value and Confidence:**\nThe verified value is for the linear coefficient\
