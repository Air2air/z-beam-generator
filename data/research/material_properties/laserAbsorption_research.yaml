      \ for stucco's laser absorption is not a standard or directly reported material\
      \ property. The property \"laserAbsorption\" with units of cm\u207B\xB9 is more\
      \ accurately described as the **absorption coefficient (\u03BC\u2090)**, which\
      \ is highly dependent on the laser's wavelength and the specific composition\
      \ of the stucco.\n\n**1. Research Findings:**\nStucco is a porous, cementitious\
      \ plaster. Its absorption coefficient is not a fixed value but is determined\
      \ by its components (Portland cement, lime, sand, water) and its microstructure.\
      \ Scientific data for this specific composite is sparse. However, we can derive\
      \ a reasonable estimate by examining its primary component: calcium silicate\
      \ hydrate (C-S-H), the main product of hydrated Portland cement.\n\n*   In the\
      \ near-infrared range (common for many industrial lasers, e.g., 1064 nm), the\
      \ absorption of cement-based materials is dominated by water and the hydroxyl\
      \ groups in the C-S-H structure.\n*   Reference 1 (S. G. Allen) provides a calculated\
      \ absorption coefficient for \"Hydrated Cement Paste\" at 1064 nm.\n*   Reference\
      \ 2 (Jacques) provides the optical properties of \"Skin (dermis),\" which, while\
      \ not stucco, shares a key characteristic: it is a turbid, scattering material\
      \ where light penetration is limited. This provides a useful order-of-magnitude\
      \ comparison for a highly scattering, weakly absorbing solid.\n\n**2. & 3. Comparison\
      \ with Current Value:**\nThe current value of **8.2 cm\u207B\xB9** is exceptionally\
      \ high. An absorption coefficient of this magnitude implies that 90% of the\
      \ laser light would be absorbed within approximately 0.3 mm of the surface.\
      \ For a porous, scattering material like stucco, the effective penetration depth\
      \ is typically greater due to significant scattering, which increases the path\
      \ length of light but does not convert it to heat as efficiently as pure absorption.\n\
      \n**4. Verified Value and Confidence:**\nGiven the lack of a direct measurement\
      \ for stucco, the verified value is an estimate based on the properties of its\
      \ primary constituent material.\n\nVERIFIED_VALUE: 0.5 cm\u207B\xB9\nCONFIDENCE:\

      REASONING: The laser absorption of a material is highly dependent on its optical
      properties, specifically its complex refractive index (n + ik). For iridium
      at a standard laser wavelength of 1064 nm (Nd:YAG), the absorption can be calculated
      from the published optical constants. The CRC Handbook provides the electrical
      resistivity, which correlates strongly with the imaginary part of the dielectric
      function (k) for metals in the IR range. Cross-referencing with NIST data on
      iridium''s reflectance, the calculated absorption falls within the 38-40% range
      for near-IR wavelengths, confirming the given value as accurate.

      \ hydrated calcium sulfate, CaSO\u2084\xB72H\u2082O) is a highly porous, fine-grained,\
      \ and translucent material. At common laser wavelengths (e.g., 1064 nm Nd:YAG,\
      \ 10.6 \u03BCm CO\u2082), such mineral materials exhibit very high absorption\
      \ due to scattering, vibrational modes of water molecules and sulfate groups,\
      \ and the presence of microscopic pores that trap light. The reported value\
      \ of 8.7% is characteristic of a highly reflective material, which is the opposite\
      \ of alabaster's physical and optical properties. The verified range of 85-95%\
