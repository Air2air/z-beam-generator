    description: Two-category taxonomy for laser cleaning operations based on fundamental
      physics
    reorganization_note: Categories distinguish laser-material interaction from intrinsic
      material characteristics. Mechanical properties merged into material characteristics
      per materials science standards.
    consolidation_date: '2025-10-15'
    consolidation_rationale: Merged structural_response into material_characteristics
      for scientific accuracy - mechanical properties are inherently material properties,
