# Domain Associations - Centralized Relationship Management
# =============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE: Single source of truth for all cross-domain relationships
# 
# ARCHITECTURE:
#   - Bidirectionality: Each association automatically generates both forward and reverse linkages
#   - Validation: All IDs and URLs validated before export
#   - Verification: Relationships must be research-backed with sources
#   - Mandatory: Exporters MUST read from this file (no hardcoded linkages)
# 
# USAGE:
#   Exporters read this file and generate bidirectional domain_linkages for frontmatter
# 
# VERIFICATION STATUS:
#   - verified: true  = Research-backed, peer-reviewed, or lab-confirmed
#   - verified: false = Placeholder, needs research
#
