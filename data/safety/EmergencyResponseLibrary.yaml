  # ============================================
  
  flammable-gas-extremely:
    id: flammable-gas-extremely
    hazard_type: flammable_gas
    severity: extreme
    flash_point: "<-18°C (0°F)"
    autoignition_temperature: "175°C (347°F)"
    explosive_range: LEL <10%, wide explosive range
    vapor_density: Heavier than air
    
    immediate_hazard_assessment:
      fire_risk: CRITICAL - extremely high
      explosion_risk: CRITICAL - vapors form explosive mixtures with air
      health_risk: HIGH - irritant, narcotic at high concentrations
      environmental_risk: MODERATE - biodegrades quickly
      ignition_sensitivity: EXTREME - any ignition source
      propagation: Vapors travel along ground to distant ignition sources
      
    evacuation_criteria:
      immediate:
        - Fire or explosion
        - Uncontrolled large release (>50 gallons)
        - Confined space release
        - Unknown concentration
      distance:
        small_spill: 50 feet minimum
        large_spill: 330 feet (100 meters) minimum
        fire: 800 feet (0.5 miles) if tank involved
      notification:
        - Activate fire alarm if building system exists
        - Call 911 immediately
        - Notify facility emergency coordinator

    fire_response:
      approach_distance:
        small_fire: 50 feet minimum with proper PPE
        large_fire: 800 feet (0.5 miles)
        tank_fire: DO NOT APPROACH - evacuate area
      immediate_actions:
        - EVACUATE if fire cannot be controlled immediately
        - Call fire department immediately (911)
