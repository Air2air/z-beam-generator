            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
            impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal
              stress
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
            - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
            - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
            - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
            - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
          - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
            severity: high
            threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
            impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
            solutions:
            - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
            - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
            - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
            - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
            - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach

            threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
            impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal
              stress
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
            - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
            - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
            - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
            - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
          - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
            severity: high
            threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
            impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
            solutions:
            - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
            - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
            - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
            - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
            - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach

          Copper, mapping power against pulse width to highlight green areas where
          the metal's high thermal conductivity prevents overheating, while red zones
          indicate risks like surface melting due to its reflectivity absorbing energy
          unevenly. It helps you select parameters that avoid material damage, ensuring
          efficient oxide removal without compromising Copper's integrity. Focus on
          the narrow green band around 30-50W and short pulses under 100μs to maximize
          cleaning effectiveness while staying clear of the red boundary where vaporization
          begins.
      energy_coupling_heatmap:

          unless an oxide layer forms. It helps you pinpoint narrow optimal zones—often
          around 30-50W with short pulses—where energy transfer peaks, enabling precise
          configuration to clean contaminants without excessive heat buildup from
          Copper's superior thermal conductivity. Watch for the transition to lower
          efficiency above 60W, signaling potential surface melting risks during extended
          operation.
      thermal_stress_heatmap:
        title: Thermal Stress Heatmap
        description: This heatmap visualizes thermal stress risks on copper surfaces,
          highlighting zones of potential warping or distortion based on laser power,

          that rapidly spreads heat but can still cause uneven expansion. It helps
          you configure safe laser cleaning parameters by steering clear of red high-risk
          areas, ensuring effective oxide removal without damaging the material's
          ductility or surface integrity. For instance, note the narrow green safe
          band around 30-40W where copper's reflectivity allows absorption without
          excessive localized heating.
      process_effectiveness_heatmap:
        title: Process Effectiveness Heatmap

          zones), optimal removal (green sweet spot), and over-processing risks (red
          areas) to ensure complete contaminant elimination without surface damage.
          Copper's high reflectivity and thermal conductivity narrow the optimal window,
          so use it to pinpoint settings like 30-40W at 500mm/s where absorption is
          balanced for efficient oxide layer stripping. Adjust interactively to avoid
          reflectivity-induced hotspots that could lead to uneven cleaning or material
          warping.

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: Above 400-600°C causes dopant migration
            impact: Heat causes permanent alteration of electronic properties and
              device failure
            solutions:
            - Use ultrashort pulses (picosecond or femtosecond) for minimal heat-affected
              zone
            - Reduce power by 60-70% compared to structural materials
            - Monitor temperature with IR camera; stop if >150°C surface temperature
            - Nanosecond pulses acceptable only for non-active areas (scribe lines,
              edges)
          - challenge: Thermal stress and wafer cracking
            severity: high
            property_value: Low fracture toughness 0.75-3.0 MPa·√m
            impact: Thermal gradients cause catastrophic wafer fracture
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling for thick wafers
            - Thin wafers (<200 μm) require substrate backing for thermal management
            - Defocused beam reduces peak temperature gradients

          - challenge: Photoresist and polymer residue removal
            severity: medium
            impact: Organic residues carbonize and become harder to remove
            solutions:
            - First pass 20W fast (1500 mm/s) for bulk removal
            - Second pass 10W slow (800 mm/s) for residue
            - UV laser (355nm) more effective for organic materials
            - Oxygen-rich environment aids in organic ablation

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: Above 150-300°C causes spontaneous ignition in
              air
            impact: Rare-earth metals oxidize rapidly forming insulating oxide layer;
              fine particles pyrophoric
            solutions:
            - Process in inert atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) or high vacuum
            - Use pulse mode with 10-15 second cooling to prevent sustained heating
            - Keep surface temperature below 150°C monitored with IR camera
            - Have fire suppression ready for pyrophoric materials
            - Immediate passivation after cleaning to prevent further oxidation

            property_value: 3-8 mm²/s thermal diffusivity (2.7x variation)
            impact: Different lanthanides require different cooling strategies
            solutions:
            - Light lanthanides (La, Ce, Pr) require more cooling time
            - Heavy lanthanides (Dy, Er, Yb) tolerate slightly higher power

            - Gradual power increase (15W → 25W → 35W) across multiple passes
            - Collect all ablated material for potential recovery
            - Document process for traceability and quality control
            - Consider chemical pre-treatment to reduce laser exposure
          - challenge: Strategic material handling requirements
            severity: medium
            impact: Export-controlled materials require documentation and secure handling
            solutions:

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
            impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal
              stress
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
            - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
            - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
            - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
            - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
          - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
            severity: high
            threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
            impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
            solutions:
            - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
            - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
            - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
            - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
            - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: Above 400-600°C causes dopant migration
            impact: Heat causes permanent alteration of electronic properties and
              device failure
            solutions:
            - Use ultrashort pulses (picosecond or femtosecond) for minimal heat-affected
              zone
            - Reduce power by 60-70% compared to structural materials
            - Monitor temperature with IR camera; stop if >150°C surface temperature
            - Nanosecond pulses acceptable only for non-active areas (scribe lines,
              edges)

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: ΔT > 50-150°C rapid cooling (stone-dependent)
            impact: Natural stone contains microfissures that propagate under thermal
              stress
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 8-12 second cooling between passes
            - Reduce power by 40-50% for weathered or damaged stone
            - Preheat substrate if possible to reduce thermal gradients
            - Granite more resistant than marble; sandstone most vulnerable
            - Monitor for surface crazing; stop immediately if cracks appear
          - challenge: Moisture-induced spalling
            severity: high
            threshold_temperature: Steam formation >100°C with trapped moisture
            impact: Porous stone traps moisture that explosively converts to steam
            solutions:
            - Test moisture content before cleaning (>3% requires drying)
            - Allow 48-72 hours drying after rain before laser cleaning
            - Reduce power by 50% for damp stone
            - Use pulse mode with extended cooling (15-20 seconds)
            - Heritage stone requires especially gentle approach

            impact: Glass shatters from thermal gradients due to low thermal expansion
              and brittleness
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 5-8 second cooling between passes
            - Preheat substrate to room temperature before cleaning
            - Avoid cold spots (air vents, cold backing) during processing
            - Tempered glass more resistant but still susceptible to thermal shock

            severity: critical
            threshold_temperature: ΔT > 40-100°C rapid cooling (glass-dependent)
            impact: Glass shatters from thermal gradients due to low thermal expansion
              and brittleness
            solutions:
            - Use pulse mode with 5-8 second cooling between passes
            - Preheat substrate to room temperature before cleaning
            - Avoid cold spots (air vents, cold backing) during processing
            - Tempered glass more resistant but still susceptible to thermal shock
            - Monitor for stress fractures; stop immediately if cracks appear
          - challenge: Low thermal diffusivity
            severity: high
            property_value: 0.01-15 mm²/s (most glasses 0.5-1.0 mm²/s)
            impact: Heat accumulates in localized zones creating thermal gradients
            solutions:
            - Reduce power by 30-40% compared to metals
            - Increase scan speed to distribute heat (1000-2000 mm/s)
            - Use defocused beam to spread energy over larger area
            - Optical-grade glass (fused silica) tolerates higher power
