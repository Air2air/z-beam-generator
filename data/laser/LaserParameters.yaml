      warnings:
        - Avoid excessive fluence (>8 J/cm²) to prevent melting
        - Monitor for substrate discoloration (indicates overheating)
        - Test parameters on sample before production cleaning
        
    process_optimization:
      best_practices:
        - Start with lower power, increase gradually
        - Use multiple passes rather than single high-power pass
        - Overlap scan lines by 30-50% for uniform coverage
        - Clean in cross-hatch pattern for heavy rust
        - Monitor substrate temperature (IR camera recommended)
      troubleshooting:
        incomplete_removal: Increase fluence or add passes
        substrate_damage: Reduce fluence or power
        uneven_cleaning: Improve overlap or reduce scan speed
        excessive_fumes: Improve ventilation, reduce power
