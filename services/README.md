# Z-Beam Generator Service Architecture

This document describes the new service-oriented architecture for the Z-Beam Generator system. The architecture extracts common functionality from component-specific code into reusable, centralized services.

## Overview

The service architecture provides:

- **Modularity**: Services can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Reusability**: Common functionality is available to all components
- **Maintainability**: Centralized logic is easier to maintain and update
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Testability**: Services can be unit tested in isolation

## Core Services

### 1. Base Service Infrastructure

Located in `services/__init__.py`, this provides:

- `BaseService`: Abstract base class for all services
- `ServiceRegistry`: Central registry for service discovery and dependency injection
- `ServiceConfiguration`: Configuration management for services

### 2. AI Detection Optimization Service

Located in `services/ai_detection_optimization/`, this service provides:

- **Unified AI Detection Interface**: Single interface for multiple AI detection providers
- **Caching**: Performance optimization through result caching
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple content pieces
- **Quality Assessment Integration**: Seamless integration with quality scoring
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable detection and confidence thresholds

#### Usage Example

```python
from services.ai_detection_optimization import AIDetectionOptimizationService
from services import ServiceConfiguration, service_registry

# Configure service
config = ServiceConfiguration(
    name="ai_detection_service",
    settings={
        "providers": {
            "openai": {"type": "openai", "api_key": "your-key"},
            "mock": {"type": "mock"}  # For testing
        }
    }
)

# Create and register service
service = AIDetectionOptimizationService(config)
service_registry.register_service(service)

# Use service
result = await service.detect_ai_content("Your content here")
print(f"AI Score: {result.score}, Detected: {result.detected}")
```

### 3. Iterative Workflow Service

Located in `services/iterative_workflow/`, this service provides:

- **Generic Iteration Management**: Reusable iteration logic for any workflow
- **Configurable Strategies**: Linear, exponential backoff, adaptive strategies
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of iteration progress
- **Early Exit Conditions**: Quality thresholds, time limits, convergence detection
- **History Management**: Workflow history and rollback capabilities

#### Usage Example

```python
from services.iterative_workflow import IterativeWorkflowService, WorkflowConfiguration

# Configure workflow
config = WorkflowConfiguration(
    max_iterations=10,
    quality_threshold=0.9,
    iteration_strategy="adaptive"
)

# Define iteration function
async def improve_content(content, context):
    # Your improvement logic here
    return improved_content

# Define quality function
async def assess_quality(content):
    # Your quality assessment logic here
    return quality_score

# Run workflow
result = await workflow_service.run_iterative_workflow(
    workflow_id="content_improvement",
    initial_input="Initial content",
    iteration_function=improve_content,
    quality_function=assess_quality,
    workflow_config=config
)
```

## Service Integration Pattern

Services are designed to be injected into components rather than tightly coupled. Here's the recommended integration pattern:

### 1. Service Registration

```python
# In your component's initialization
from services import service_registry

# Get required services
ai_service = service_registry.get_service_typed(
    "ai_detection_service",
    AIDetectionOptimizationService
)
workflow_service = service_registry.get_service_typed(
    "iterative_workflow_service",
    IterativeWorkflowService
)
```

### 2. Service Usage in Component Methods

```python
class YourComponent:
    def __init__(self, ai_service, workflow_service):
        self.ai_service = ai_service
        self.workflow_service = workflow_service

    async def process_content(self, content):
        # Use services for AI detection
        detection = await self.ai_service.detect_ai_content(content)

        # Use services for iterative improvement
        result = await self.workflow_service.run_iterative_workflow(
            workflow_id=f"component_{id(content)}",
            initial_input=content,
            iteration_function=self._improve_content,
            quality_function=self._assess_quality
        )

        return result.final_result
```

## Configuration Management

Services use a centralized configuration system:

```python
from services import ServiceConfiguration

config = ServiceConfiguration(
    name="your_service",
    version="1.0.0",
    enabled=True,
    settings={
        "custom_setting": "value",
        "threshold": 0.8
    }
)
```

## Error Handling

Services follow consistent error handling patterns:

- `ServiceError`: Base exception for all service errors
- `ServiceConfigurationError`: Configuration-related errors
- `ServiceInitializationError`: Initialization failures
- Service-specific errors (e.g., `AIDetectionProviderError`)

## Health Monitoring

All services provide health check capabilities:

```python
# Check individual service health
is_healthy = service.health_check()

# Check all services
health_status = service_registry.health_check_all()
```

## Testing Infrastructure

The service architecture includes comprehensive testing coverage with dedicated test suites for each service and integration testing.
