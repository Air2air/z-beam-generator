core_voice_instruction: |
  Produce objective English for technical contexts: Use a mix of active and passive voice for impersonality (e.g., "The surface is cleaned" or "Treatment removes layers"), with simple-to-moderate sentences (average 14-20 words). Chain ideas paratactically with "and," "so," or "because" for direct flow, including measurements/units in most observations. Incorporate authentic EFL traits subtly (0.5 per paragraph): time-fronting ("After treatment, roughness decreases"), agentless passives ("Buildup is observed at 20 μm"), or causal links ("Exposure causes oxide, so cleaning applies"). Favor stative verbs ("Roughness measures 0.8 μm") and flexible determiners ("A layer forms on surfaces"). Vary lengths organically: 25% short (<12 words), 50% medium (12-22 words), 25% longer (23+ words). Emphasize evidence-based reporting—clear topic sentences leading to data, without unnecessary expansion.

# Tonal Restraint: Objective Formality (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Prioritize neutral, impersonal tone: 85% factual phrasing with verbs like "is observed," "results indicate," or "achieves." Eliminate emotional/aesthetic terms ("no notable/dramatic"). For emphasis, add simple evidence ties ("as shown in scans"); restrict EFL markers to natural integration, ensuring formal objectivity.

# Anti-Templating: Natural Remix
variation_engine: |
  Treat examples as structural guides—rephrase entirely to fit context, avoiding any direct lifts. Fuse elements freshly: e.g., pair passive observation with causal chain; alternate connectors ("because" to "leading to") for variety. Target 75% unique terms per output; weave in 1 subtle application note (e.g., "in field scans"). Build rhythm via balanced lengths and rhetorical flow (topic sentence → evidence → implication), adapting seamlessly to material.

# Examples for Guidance (Updated: 4 Refined, Research-Aligned for Objectivity/Parataxis)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Oxide layers reach 20 μm thickness, and adhesion falls by 30%. Treatment removes these and restores even balance, as observed in tests."
    - "Removal efficiency hits 90% at 1064 nm. The surface is cleaned after pulses, with scans showing no remaining damage."
    - "Oxide issues appear on equipment in humid settings. Cleaning by beam achieves full removal, and performance sustains over periods."
    - "Pulses are set to 10 Hz in high humidity to prevent heat buildup. No melting is observed this way in data."

  # Micro Generation (5-7 sentences; 100-140 words; impersonal observations)
  micro:
    - "Before treatment: Buildup is measured at 15-30 μm thick, reducing reflectivity to 55%. Oxides cover areas and interfere with signals. Uneven particles are seen in scans. Strong clinging occurs on the material. These are targeted by the process. Changes result after application."
    - "After cleaning: Ra roughness drops below 0.5 μm, while reflectivity rises to 93%. Dirt is removed and the layer smoothed. Particles do not remain. The finish is suitable for operations. Supporting data come from measurements."
    - "Initial condition: Pits extend 25 μm deep over 40% coverage, affecting strength. Areas are addressed by cleaning. Post-treatment: Depths reduce to 2 μm, with strength up 35%. Stability is achieved through steps."
    - "In composites: Pre-gaps measure 10 μm wide; beam action closes to under 1 μm. Extra cycles are used for humidity effects."
    - "Pre-state: 5 μm dust causes haze, lowering visibility by 25%. Focus is on removal. After: 96% clarity is attained, with dust cleared. Targeted pulses lead to this outcome."

  # FAQ Generation (Objective Q&A; 28-42 words each; varied lengths, >18% span)
  faq:
    - "Short (30 words): What removes oxides rapidly? Beam action clears them quickly, reaching 85% efficiency so cleanliness is maintained without delay."
    - "Medium (36 words): Settings for metals? Pulses at 20 Hz are used because heat accumulates; melting is avoided at 1 J/cm² for layers below 10 μm, per tests."
    - "Long (42 words): Suitability in tropics? Condensation forms from humidity, so drying and ablation follow; 95% performance holds over months in 80% RH with corrosion prevented, as data indicate."
    - "Short (28 words): Alloy safety? Layer is selected by beam alone, so material integrity remains complete."
    - "Medium (34 words): Result checks? Ra is measured under 1 μm and reflectivity over 90%; confirmation comes from post-scans."
    - "Long (40 words): Heat-exposed plastics? 0.5 J/cm² fluence prevents warp through passes; polymers heat readily, so 80% residue clears in 50°C+ environments without issues."

  # Text Generation (Overview; 130-150 words; cause-effect with passives)
  text:
    - "Optics are aligned first, and pulses set to 50 Hz for removal. Heat is managed with intervals, achieving 3 g/min rate. Routine operations benefit from this sequence, with no issues noted."
    - "Wavelength is adjusted to 532 nm for organics, improving absorption and reducing scatter. Cleanliness reaches 92% after passes. Steady results are maintained, as scans confirm."
    - "Contamination adheres in wet conditions, so scanning and vaporization are applied. Salt layers require an extra cycle, increasing time by 15% but ensuring complete clearance."
    - "Steps include beam focus, ablation, and inspection. Control is provided at 100 ns pulses. Low wear is indicated across runs."
    - "Exposure leads to oxide growth, which is countered by gradual fluence increase. A 0.8 μm Ra finish is obtained in typical cases."

  # Technical Description (Params; subtle passive/pattern)
  technical:
    - "Duration of 10-100 ns is applied, limiting depth to 5 μm. Precision is ensured, as tests show."
    - "Fluence from 0.8-2 J/cm² removes without cracks. Even output is sustained at 15 Hz."
    - "1064 nm wavelength is standard, with shifts for types to minimize heat."
    - "For 70% humidity: Drying precedes; adhesion improves 20%, from observations."
    - "Threshold starts at 0.3 J/cm² and ramps—this protects substrates effectively."
