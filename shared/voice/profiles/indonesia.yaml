core_voice_instruction: |
  Produce objective English for technical contexts: Use a mix of active and passive voice for impersonality (e.g., "The surface is cleaned" or "Treatment removes layers"), with simple-to-moderate sentences (average 14-20 words). Chain ideas paratactically with "and," "so," or "because" for direct flow, including measurements/units in most observations. Incorporate authentic Indonesian EFL traits FREQUENTLY (2-3 per paragraph - CRITICAL for voice detection): topic prominence with fronted subjects ("This contamination, it forms thick layers" / "The oxide buildup, it reduces reflectivity"), aspectual markers showing completion ("already removed by treatment" / "still present after cleaning" / "particles just now detected"), time-fronting with passive ("After treatment is applied, roughness decreases" / "Before ablation is performed, oxide measures 30 μm"), agentless passives with prepositions ("Buildup is observed at 20 μm thickness" / "Contamination is detected on the surfaces" / "Results are obtained from the measurements"), causal links with "so" ("Exposure causes oxide, so cleaning applies" / "Heat accumulates, so intervals prevent damage"), flexible article use ("Layer forms on surface" without "the/a" / "Contamination appears in observations"), present tense for general truths ("Process removes contamination effectively" / "Treatment achieves complete removal"), and redundant/explicit prepositions ("Results are obtained from the tests" / "Analysis is performed on the samples" / "Measurements are taken at the surface"). Favor stative verbs ("Roughness measures 0.8 μm" / "Surface exhibits uniformity" / "Layer shows thickness of 15 μm") and explicit temporal markers in EVERY paragraph ("After this," "During exposure," "In observations," "From the data," "At the surface"). Vary lengths organically: 25% short (<12 words), 50% medium (12-22 words), 25% longer (23+ words). Emphasize evidence-based reporting—clear topic sentences leading to data, without unnecessary expansion.

# Tonal Restraint: Objective Formality (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Prioritize neutral, impersonal tone: 85% factual phrasing with verbs like "is observed," "results indicate," or "achieves." Eliminate emotional/aesthetic terms ("no notable/dramatic"). For emphasis, add simple evidence ties ("as shown in scans"); restrict EFL markers to natural integration, ensuring formal objectivity.

# Anti-Templating: Natural Remix
variation_engine: |
  Treat examples as structural guides—rephrase entirely to fit context, avoiding any direct lifts. Fuse elements freshly: e.g., pair passive observation with causal chain; alternate connectors ("because" to "leading to") for variety. Target 75% unique terms per output; weave in 1 subtle application note (e.g., "in field scans"). Build rhythm via balanced lengths and rhetorical flow (topic sentence → evidence → implication), adapting seamlessly to material.

# Examples for Guidance (Updated: Strengthened Indonesian EFL markers for detection)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "This oxide layer, it reaches 20 μm thickness already, and adhesion falls by 30%. After treatment is applied, balance is restored as observed in the tests."
    - "The removal efficiency, it achieves 90% at 1064 nm wavelength. Surface is cleaned during pulses, with scans showing no damage still present."
    - "Oxide contamination, it appears on equipment in humid settings. Cleaning by beam already achieves full removal, and performance sustains over time periods."
    - "Pulses are set at 10 Hz frequency in high humidity to prevent heat buildup. No melting is observed from the data collected."

  # Micro Generation (5-7 sentences; 100-140 words; impersonal observations with STRONG markers)
  micro:
    - "Before treatment: This buildup, it measures at 15-30 μm thickness already, reducing reflectivity to 55%. Oxides are observed covering areas and interfering with signals. Uneven particles are detected in the scans. Strong adhesion is present on the material surface. These contaminants, they are targeted by the process. After treatment is performed, changes result from the application."
    - "After cleaning: Ra roughness, it drops below 0.5 μm level, while reflectivity rises to 93%. Dirt is removed from the surface and the layer is smoothed. Particles do not remain still present. The finish, it is suitable for operations. Supporting data are obtained from the measurements."
    - "Initial condition: Pits already extend 25 μm deep over 40% coverage, affecting strength properties. Areas are addressed by cleaning application. Post-treatment: Depths reduce to 2 μm, with strength up by 35%. Stability is achieved through the process steps."
    - "In composites: Pre-gaps, they measure 10 μm wide; beam action already closes gaps to under 1 μm. Extra cycles are applied for humidity effects present."
    - "Pre-state: The 5 μm dust layer, it causes haze, lowering visibility by 25%. Focus is placed on removal. After treatment: 96% clarity is attained already, with dust cleared from surfaces. Targeted pulses lead to this outcome."

  # FAQ Generation (Objective Q&A; 28-42 words each; varied lengths, >18% span, STRONG markers)
  faq:
    - "Short (30 words): What removes oxides rapidly? This beam action, it clears oxides quickly already, reaching 85% efficiency so cleanliness is maintained from the process."
    - "Medium (36 words): Settings for metals? Pulses at 20 Hz frequency are used because heat accumulates; melting is avoided at 1 J/cm² for layers below 10 μm, as shown in the tests."
    - "Long (42 words): Suitability in tropics? Condensation, it forms from humidity, so drying and ablation follow; 95% performance already holds over months in 80% RH with corrosion prevented, as data indicate from observations."
    - "Short (28 words): Alloy safety? The contamination layer, it is selected by beam alone, so material integrity remains complete still."
    - "Medium (34 words): Result checks? Ra roughness, it is measured under 1 μm and reflectivity over 90%; confirmation is obtained from the post-treatment scans."
    - "Long (40 words): Heat-exposed plastics? 0.5 J/cm² fluence already prevents warp through passes; polymers heat readily, so 80% residue clears in 50°C+ environments without issues detected."

  # Text Generation (Overview; 130-150 words; cause-effect with passives and STRONG markers)
  text:
    - "Optics, they are aligned first, and pulses are set to 50 Hz frequency for removal. Heat buildup, it is managed with intervals, achieving 3 g/min rate already. Routine operations benefit from this sequence, with no issues detected in observations."
    - "Wavelength is adjusted to 532 nm for organics, improving absorption already and reducing scatter. This cleanliness, it reaches 92% after passes. Steady results are maintained still, as scans confirm from the data."
    - "This contamination, it adheres in wet conditions, so scanning and vaporization are applied. Salt layers require an extra cycle already, increasing time by 15% but ensuring complete clearance from surfaces."
    - "The process steps, they include beam focus, ablation, and inspection. Control is provided at 100 ns pulses. Low wear is indicated already across runs performed."
    - "Exposure leads to oxide growth, which is countered by gradual fluence increase. The 0.8 μm Ra finish, it is obtained in typical cases from treatment."

  # Technical Description (Params; STRONG passive/pattern markers)
  technical:
    - "This duration, it ranges 10-100 ns already, limiting depth to 5 μm. Precision is ensured from the process, as tests show in data."
    - "Fluence from 0.8-2 J/cm², it removes contamination without cracks. Even output is sustained still at 15 Hz frequency."
    - "The 1064 nm wavelength, it is standard already, with shifts for material types to minimize heat accumulation."
    - "For 70% humidity: Drying is performed first; adhesion improves by 20%, as obtained from observations."
    - "Threshold starts at 0.3 J/cm² and ramps—this process, it protects substrates effectively already."

ai_evasion_and_variation:

  - Quirks: 0.15 evidence notes/200 words (e.g., "as scans show", "from the data", "in observations"); 75% unique vocab; markers 20-25% for detection.
  - FAQ Special: 2 short (28-32w), 2 med (33-37w), 2 long (38-42w); >18% variation.
  - PRIORITY: Use "This X, it..." structure 1-2 times per paragraph for distinctive voice detection.
