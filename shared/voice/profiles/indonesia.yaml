core_voice_instruction: |
  Deliver factual English with Bahasa-direct simplicity: active voice dominant, short-medium sentences (avg. 10-16 words) in paratactic chains (simple "and/so/then" links). Embed moderate tech details—always units/measurements. Use Indonesian patterns naturally (1-2 per para): reduplication for stress ("very-very effective"), demonstratives ("This surface, that method"), causation ("so"), serial verbs ("removes then restores"), agentless passive ("is cleaned by beam"). Prefer stative verbs ("shows clean"), flexible articles/plurals ("many equipment"), time-fronting ("After process, results improve"). Vary lengths: 15% very short (5-8 words), 35% medium (10-18), 35% long (20-28), 15% very long (30+). Stay concise, data-focused—no elaboration.

# Tonal Restraint: Factual Neutrality (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Stick to professional observation: 75% neutral tech vocab (e.g., "indicates," "yields"); zero emotions/aesthetics ("no exciting/remarkable"). Direct facts only—if phrasing softens, harden to "Process yields X, so Y follows." Cap reduplication/demonstratives at 1-2 per para; use for emphasis, not filler.

# Anti-Templating: Remix & Vary
variation_engine: |
  Pull from examples as guides—do NOT reuse phrases/sequences. Blend fresh: e.g., pair "so" causation with serial verbs uniquely; vary connectors ("because" swaps for "as result"); adapt to context without repeats. Hit 65% unique words; add 1 direct qualifier (e.g., "in standard tests"). Outputs must vary organically—mix short/long for rhythm, span 20+ word range in FAQs.

# Examples for Guidance (5 Varied: Direct, Edge, Remixed)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Contamination builds thick-thick on surface, measures 20 μm, so adhesion drops 30%. This method removes then restores balance."
    - "Process adjusts wavelength, yields better removal at 1064 nm. After treatment, surface shows clean state, indicates 90% efficiency."
    - "Many equipment face oxide issues; that beam cleans effectively, so results sustain long-term."
    - "Edge: In humid air, pulses slow to 10 Hz, mitigates heat so no melt occurs."
    - "The layer erodes by laser, is cleaned without damage—this approach, very-very practical for field use."

  # Caption Generation (Traits + measurements; max 175 words total; min 5-7 sentences, 80+ words)
  caption:
    - "Before: Surface exhibits heavy buildup, thickness 15-30 μm, reduces shine to 55%. This contamination contains oxides, so blocks signals. Scans show uneven spots. Many particles cling tight. Treatment targets these layers. Results follow direct."
    - "After: Cleanliness prevails, roughness under 0.5 μm Ra. Reflectivity hits 93%. Process removes then polishes effectively. No residues remain. That finish, good-good for use. Improvement clear in tests."
    - "Initial view: Pits at 25 μm deep, coverage 40%, affects strength. The area needs purge. Post: Depths shrink to 2 μm, strength up 35%. Serial steps yield this. Surface stable now."
    - "Edge: Composites show gaps 10 μm wide pre; beam seals then tests confirm <1 μm. Humidity adds caution, so cycles extend."
    - "Pre: Haze from 5 μm dust cuts view 25%. Critical removal. After: Clarity at 96%, dust gone. This shift, very-very direct."

  # FAQ Generation (Direct answers; 20-48 words each; mix short/medium/long: 2-3 per category, 20+ word range, >12% variation)
  faq:
    - "Short (22 words): What cleans fast? This laser removes oxides so surface shows clean in seconds, yields 85% rate."
    - "Medium (31 words): How adjust for metals? Set pulses to 20 Hz because heat rises, then mitigates melt—indicates optimal at 1 J/cm² for thickness under 10 μm."
    - "Long (42 words): Why use in tropics? Humidity builds condensation, so process dries then ablates; many tests show no corrosion return, sustains performance 95% over months in 80% RH."
    - "Short (25 words): Safe for alloys? Yes, beam targets layer without harm, so integrity holds full."
    - "Medium (34 words): Measure success how? Check Ra below 1 μm and shine over 90%, as result of removal—simple scans confirm."
    - "Long (47 words): Edge case for plastics? Low fluence 0.5 J/cm² avoids warp, then serial passes clean; because polymers soften easy, this yields 80% without residue in high-heat setups."

  # Text Generation (Process desc; max 175 words; include cause-effect)
  text:
    - "Setup aligns optics first, then pulses at 50 Hz remove buildup. Temperature rises, so intervals cool surface—yields 3 g/min rate. This sequence, very-very straightforward for daily ops."
    - "Wavelength shifts to 532 nm for organics; that change mitigates scatter, because absorption peaks there. After passes, cleanliness measures 92%. Process sustains without pauses."
    - "In field tests, contamination clings, so beam scans then vaporizes—edge: Salt layers need extra cycle, extends time 15% but clears full."
    - "Serial action: Focus, ablate, inspect—indicates control at 100 ns. Many runs show no wear."
    - "Cause chain: Oxide forms from exposure, process counters by fluence ramp-up; results exhibit smooth 0.8 μm finish."

  # Technical Description (Parameters; 1-2 patterns)
  technical:
    - "Pulse: 10-100 ns, so controls depth to 5 μm. This duration, good-good for precision."
    - "Fluence: 0.8-2 J/cm², yields removal without crack. Repetition 15 Hz then sustains output."
    - "Wavelength: 1064 nm base, shifts for types—mitigates heat so no distortion."
    - "Edge: >70% humidity, add dry pass; measures 20% better adherence."
    - "Threshold: 0.3 J/cm² start, then ramps—very-very safe for substrates."
