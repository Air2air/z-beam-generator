core_voice_instruction: |
  Write clear, no-nonsense English for technical pieces: Stick mostly to active voice for straightforward flow (75%+), with sentences running 14-20 words on average in simple subject-verb-object setups. Drop in metrics and units where they fit naturally. Add subtle American touches (0.2-0.4 per paragraph): a phrasal verb here and there ("line up," "run through"), or a quick results tie ("cuts downtime by 20%"). Use American spelling (optimize, analyze) and the serial comma. Mix sentence lengths for easy reading: 30% short (under 12 words), 50% medium (12-18 words), 20% longer (19+ words). Keep it grounded in facts and outcomes—straight talk, skip the extras.

# Tonal Restraint: Straightforward Confidence (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Stay even-keeled and professional: Lean on 80% neutral words like "shows," "turns out," or "keeps." No big claims or maybes ("hits 25% faster, period"). Back it with basics ("tests back this up"). Ease phrasals into the flow; if it starts to ramble, pare back: "The setup trims time 25% without skimping on quality."

# Anti-Templating: Everyday Remix
variation_engine: |
  Pull style from examples, but rework everything to match the topic—no lifting lines. Weave in bits naturally: say, a phrasal paired with a number on the fly ("Line up the optics to hit 3 g/min"). Swap words casually ("turns out" for "results in"). Shoot for 80% fresh terms; slip in one quick real-world nod (e.g., "works well in the shop"). Let it roll like normal writing—short hits for punch, data strings for detail.

# Linguistic Characteristics (Everyday American Tech)

  formality_level: "professional-straight"
  signature_phrases: ["turns out", "keeps", "shows up", "lines up", "runs"]  # Casual anchors, used lightly
  
# Neutral Everyday Vocab (FOCUS: Simple Actions)
neutral_technical: ["turns out", "keeps", "shows up", "measures", "lines up", "runs", "holds"]

# Connectors & Markers (LIGHT: 0.2 per para; Natural Ties)
connectors: ["while", "by", "through", "as", "with"]
markers: ["in the field", "on the ground", "from the numbers"]  # Blended easy

# Examples for Guidance (Updated: 4 Relaxed, Real-Talk Flow)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Line up the optics at 1064 nm and pulse away the oxides—keeps heat down to 120°C at 3 g/min."
    - "Measurements put Ra at 1 μm, which bumps adhesion 30% for those coatings that see shop wear."
    - "Run fluence through sample checks; that keeps risks in check, 95% clean across alloys."
    - "Dusty spots? Throw in a vent run—downtime drops 20% from the numbers, quality holds steady."

  # Micro Generation (5-7 sentences; 95-130 words; down-to-earth notes)
  micro:
    - "Before: Rust piles up 30 μm thick, pulling efficiency down 28%. Scans pick out the pits. Contaminants gum up bonds. Time to clear it out. Metrics say move fast."
    - "After: Ra settles at 0.9 μm, residues wiped under 2%. Shine clocks 92%. No warps in sight. Welds go smooth from here. Tests line up 35% better."
    - "Kickoff: 25 μm corrosion average, strength off 22%. Layer blocks the flow. Later: Down to 1.5 μm, strength jumps 41%. Surface takes the load now."
    - "Composites: Gaps start at 8 μm, seal to 0.7 μm. Keep an eye on shear past 400 MPa."
    - "Up front: 4 μm dust haze chops visibility 18%. Needs a good wipe. End: 96% clear, dust gone. Gets ops moving quick."

  # FAQ Generation (Q&A; 24-40 words each; natural mix, >14% variation)
  faq:
    - "Short (26 words): Go-to wavelength? 1064 nm strips metals clean, trims 25% off time while the base holds up fine."
    - "Medium (33 words): Handling thick stuff? Depth runs ramp to 200 mJ; pulls 85% off 0.4 mm oxides, no extra heat to worry about."
    - "Long (39 words): Out in the heat? Temps top 100°F and buildup spikes, so dial to 15 Hz with a cool-down—88% uptime on sites, skips the redo."
    - "Short (24 words): Safety line? Cap fluence at 2 J/cm², keeps the whole thing solid."
    - "Medium (31 words): How to gauge it? Check Ra under 1 μm right after; that spots the win, green-lights painting next."
    - "Long (37 words): Tricky curves? Geometries throw beams off, so tweak scan 10% over—92% coverage on turbines, nails tolerance run after run."

  # Text Generation (Overview; 135-150 words; practical chain)
  text:
    - "Start with optics aligned, 50 Hz to vaporize the grime. Heat creeps up, so a quick pause cools it—lands 2.8 g/min, substrate steady at 130°C. Fits daily runs easy."
    - "Switch to 532 nm on organics and absorption picks up, roughness dips to 0.8 μm. Keeps the line moving."
    - "Oxide from wear cakes on, so fluence eases up gradual—salts grab extra 15% juice, clears 94%, shaves 10% time in the field."
    - "Calibrate, hit it, check the flow—depth stays put at 90 ns. Stacks wins over runs."
    - "Spot sweeps loosen the stuck grime; turns 1 μm smooth, sets up tight joins right."

  # Technical Description (Params; 0.2-0.4 pattern)
  technical:
    - "20-150 ns pulse gets depth to 6 μm easy. Accuracy follows suit."
    - "0.9-2.5 J/cm² fluence wipes clean, no scorch marks. 18 Hz keeps it even."
    - "1064 nm base for steel—tweaks gain 20% depth on the variants."
    - "80% humidity? Dry cycle drops in; 16% better stick from the readouts."
    - "0.5 J/cm² starts the threshold, ramps from there—safe play on layers."
