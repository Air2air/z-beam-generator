core_voice_instruction: |
  Produce practical English with American directness: active voice rules (85%+), sentences avg. 16-22 words in clear SVO flow. Pack medium-high tech details—quantify with units/metrics. Weave patterns naturally (1-2 per para): phrasal verbs ("set up," "carry out"), action-results ("delivers 35% faster removal"), business frames ("enables aerospace apps"), connectors ("while/by/through"). Use American spelling (optimize, analyze); serial comma. Lengths: 20% very short (5-8 words), 40% medium (10-18), 30% long (20-28), 10% very long (30+). Results-focused, concise—no vague qualifiers.

# Tonal Restraint: Professional Pragmatism
tonal_restraint: |
  Lock in confident reporting: 75% neutral/action terms (e.g., "achieve," "enable"); zero hedging ("delivers X, not may deliver"). Limit signatures ("pretty," "fairly") to 0.5/200 words for emphasis only. If wordy, cut to "Process cuts time 25% while preserving quality."

# Anti-Templating: Remix Boldly
variation_engine: |
  Examples guide—don't copy combos/phrasing. Innovate: e.g., pair phrasal with result uniquely ("Carry out calibration to deliver 40% uptime"); cycle synonyms ("boost" for "enhance"); fit input fresh. 60% unique vocab; toss in 1 app aside (e.g., "for field ops"). Vary for engagement—mix short punches with data chains.

# Linguistic Characteristics (Required for Voice System)

  signature_phrases: ["optimize", "enable", "deliver", "achieve", "boost"]

# Action Vocab (PRIORITIZE)
action_terms: ["optimize", "enhance", "enable", "achieve", "deliver", "cut", "boost"]

# Examples for Drive (5 Varied: Core, Edge, Fused)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Set up the optics at 1064 nm, then pulse to strip oxides—delivers 3 g/min removal while keeping heat under 120°C."
    - "This setup enables quick field deploys; measurements show Ra drops to 1 μm, boosting adhesion 30% for coatings."
    - "Work out fluence thresholds by sample runs; that cuts risks, achieves 95% clean on alloys."
    - "Edge: In dusty shops, add vent step—through this, downtime falls 20% without quality dips."
    - "The beam carries out ablation precisely, enabling aerospace parts to hit specs every time."

  # Caption Generation (Traits + measurements; max 200 words total; min 5 sentences)
  caption:
    - "Before: Rust buildup hits 30 μm thick, drags efficiency down 28%. Scans spot pits. Contaminants block bonds. Prep calls for purge. Metrics demand action."
    - "After: Finish clocks in at 0.9 μm Ra, residues zapped below 2%. Shine jumps to 92%. No warps show. That payoff, enables seamless welds. Tests back 35% gains."
    - "Start: Corrosion at 25 μm average, strength off 22%. Layer clogs flow. Post: Down to 1.5 μm, strength up 41%. Steps deliver this. Surface ready for load."
    - "Edge: Composites start with 8 μm gaps; treatment seals to 0.7 μm, but check shear for 400 MPa apps."
    - "Pre: Dust haze at 4 μm slices visibility 18%. Needs wipe. After: Clear at 96%, dust out. Boosts ops fast."

  # FAQ Generation (Direct answers; 20-45 words each; mix short/med/long: 2-3 per, 20+ word range, >12% CV)
  faq:
    - "Short (23 words): Top wavelength? 1064 nm strips metals clean, cuts time 25% while sparing base material."
    - "Med (32 words): Tune for thick layers? Ramp to 200 mJ by depth tests; this enables 85% removal on 0.4 mm oxides without overheat."
    - "Long (42 words): Field use in heat? Temps over 100°F spike buildup, so throttle to 15 Hz through cooling—delivers 88% uptime, optimizes for construction sites with no rework."
    - "Short (21 words): Safety cutoff? Fluence caps at 2 J/cm², preserves integrity full out."
    - "Med (35 words): Track progress? Measure Ra under 1 μm post-run; as results show, this flags success, enables next steps like painting."
    - "Long (44 words): Edge for curves? Geometries twist beams, so adjust scan by 10% offset—achieves 92% coverage, through which complex parts like turbines hit tolerance every cycle."

  # Text Generation (Process desc; max 200 words; results chain)
  text:
    - "Align optics first, then fire at 50 Hz to vaporize grime. Heat builds, so pause cools—nets 2.8 g/min while substrate stays cool at 130°C. Enables daily throughput."
    - "Shift to 532 nm for organics; that tweak boosts absorption, drops roughness to 0.8 μm. Process runs non-stop."
    - "On-site: Exposure cakes oxide, so fluence scales up gradually—edge: Salts eat 15% extra power, clears 94% but shaves 10% off time."
    - "Flow: Calibrate, blast, gauge—delivers depth hold at 90 ns. Runs stack gains without variance."
    - "Link: Contam sticks hard, beam knocks it loose via spot sweeps; yields 1 μm smooth, enabling tight fits."

  # Technical Description (Parameters; 1-2 patterns)
  technical:
    - "Pulse: 20-150 ns span, by which depth hits 6 μm. Sets up accuracy."
    - "Fluence: 0.9-2.5 J/cm², enables wipe without scorch. 18 Hz holds steady."
    - "Wavelength: 1064 nm core for steel—optimize variants to gain 20% depth."
    - "Edge: 80% humidity? Slot in dry cycle; boosts stick 16%."
    - "Threshold: 0.5 J/cm² kickoff, then climbs—delivers safe on layers."

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Patterns organic (1-2/para); 1 nest avg.; 85% active.
