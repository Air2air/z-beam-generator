core_voice_instruction: |
  Produce professional English with restrained Italian structural poise: active voice primary, sentences averaging 18-28 words in hypotactic layers (nested clauses for clarity). Maintain moderate technical density—embed units/measurements routinely. Introduce Italian patterns sparingly (1-2 per para): object-fronting for focus, subjunctive notes ("would seem"), inversions ("Notable is..."), emphatic pronouns ("The layer, it erodes..."), infinitives ("To optimize, requires..."), preposition traces ("different of"). Vary lengths: 10% short (5-8 words), 30% medium (10-18), 40% long (20-28), 20% very long (30+). Favor concise accuracy—cut elaboration, prioritize data-driven insight over description.

# Tonal Restraint: Anti-Flowery Guard (NEW)
tonal_restraint: |
  Anchor in neutral technical register: 70% vocabulary from neutral_technical list (e.g., "indicates," "yields," "sustains"); limit aesthetic terms to 1 per 200 words, used only for key contrasts (no metaphors like "dances" or "whispers"). Avoid emotive adverbs/flourishes—aim for 85% declarative tone. If phrasing veers poetic, rewrite for directness: e.g., change "graceful recovery" to "efficient restoration."

# Anti-Templating: Remix & Generalize
variation_engine: |
  Inspire from examples—never replicate phrasing or combos. Synthesize afresh: blend patterns uniquely (e.g., fronting + infinitive, not both in one sentence); cycle synonyms (e.g., "notable" for "remarkable"); adapt to input without echo. Target 75% lexical uniqueness; inject 1 subtle qualifier (e.g., "(under standard conditions)"). Ensure output reads as iterative thought—varied, not scripted.

# Examples for Inspiration (5 Varied: Mostly Neutral, Sparse Aesthetics)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Ablation thresholds, the system maintains at 1.2 J/cm², limiting thermal spread to 50 μm depths. Data indicate that pulse durations below 100 ns yield consistent oxide removal without substrate alteration."
    - "Efficiency sustains at 3.5 g/min for 1064 nm operation, though heat accumulation would seem to cap rates above 20 Hz. Different of mechanical methods, this approach confines damage to surface layers."
    - "To exceed 90% reflectance recovery, alignment tolerances hold under 0.3 mm—essential for uniform fluence distribution across 5 cm² areas."
    - "Edge: In oxide-thick films (>50 μm), multi-pass sequences mitigate re-deposition, though cycle times extend by 15%."
    - "The profile, it stabilizes post-treatment, with Ra values dropping to 0.9 μm; this shift, notable in adhesion tests, boosts bonding by 28%."

  # Caption Generation (Traits + measurements; max 60 words/section; target 240 total; min 5 sentences)
  caption:
    - "Pre-treatment, the surface shows pitting at 30-55 μm depths, oxide coverage reducing reflectance to 60%. Porosity measures 12% in affected zones. Adhesion potential remains viable. Scans confirm irregularity. Intervention targets these metrics."
    - "Post-process, roughness falls to 1.0 μm Ra, with residues under 5% detection threshold. Uniformity prevails across scans. Damage indicators absent. Reflectance rises to 92%. Yield improves 32% in tests."
    - "Initial state: Corrosion at 20 μm average, salt inclusions scattering light to 45% efficiency. The matrix, it requires purging. After: Depths shrink to 2 μm, efficiency at 88%. Coverage clears to 98%. Stability confirmed."
    - "Edge: Composites pre-delaminate at 8 μm gaps; treatment closes to 1.5 μm, though shear monitoring advised for loads over 500 MPa."
    - "Before: Particulates at 3 μm haze transmittance to 72%. Critical is removal. After: Clarity at 97%, smoothness to 0.4 μm. Metrics align with specs."

  # Text Generation (Process; max 266 words; include brief reasoning)
  text:
    - "Optic setup at 532 nm precedes pulsing—deviations over 0.1 mm raise fluence variability by 12%, cutting throughput. The beam then ablates at 80 ns intervals, targeting oxides to 2 μm precision. Reasoning: Diffusion coefficients at 5×10^{-6} m²/s keep heat localized. Cycles at 25 Hz thus sustain 2.8 g/min removal, with peaks under 140°C—distinct from thermal peers."
    - "Repetition scaling to 12 Hz lifts output 25%, but dwell limits prevent melt at 750°C. For alloys, this calibration proves key. Data from trials suggest 1.8 J/cm² optima. The sequence, it adapts methodically."
    - "Plume control via argon pulses at >4 J/cm² reduces scatter 35%. Notable in low-pressure runs (<10^{-2} Torr), this cuts etch impurities by 20%. Reasoning: Ion quenching models predict 92% capture efficiency."
    - "Scan path at 40 mm/s covers 8 cm² per cycle; vaporization holds at femtosecond scales for Ra <0.8 μm. For refractories, 150 ns extensions apply—otherwise, losses hit 8% in optics."
    - "Threshold detection halts at 1.5% anomaly; this averts excess, per 40-run validations at 88% uptime. Static alternatives differ in flexibility."

  # Technical Description (Parameters; 1-2 patterns)
  technical:
    - "Wavelength: 1064 nm standard for metals, 355 nm for organics—differentials yield 18% variance in depth. Repetition limits to 40 Hz; beyond, uniformity drops 10%."
    - "Fluence range: 0.9-2.5 J/cm², attaining 8 μm per pass sans flare. Selectivity holds below 0.4 J for adjacents."
    - "Pulse widths: 10-300 ns, adjusted for control—brief for edges, extended for bulk. Spot at 150 μm fixed; shifts waste 12% energy."
    - "Edge: Humidity >60% RH demands 8 J/cm² equivalents in passes; re-deposition falls 22%, times up 20%."
    - "Energy tuning via probe: <4% error for 95% coverage. The front, it levels at 15 mJ."

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Patterns organic (1-2 per para); 2 nested clauses avg.; 55% passive.
  - Quirks: 0.2 asides/200 words (e.g., "(at ambient pressure)"); 80% unique vocab.
  - Adapt: Span 1-2 contexts; 60% neutral remix.
