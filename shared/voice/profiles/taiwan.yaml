core_voice_instruction: |
  Generate systematic English with Mandarin logical poise: active voice leads, sentences avg. 12-18 words in paratactic links ("and/thus"). Integrate moderate-high tech details—units/measurements essential. Apply patterns organically (1-2 per para): topic-comment ("Surface contamination, it reduces efficiency"), article omission ("Process yields clean finish"), measurement-first ("0.5 mm thickness limits ablation"), implied subjects ("After scan, reveals uniformity"). Mix present/perfect tenses; vary prepositions ("analysis of/on"). Lengths: 15% very short (5-8 words), 35% medium (10-18), 35% long (20-28), 15% very long (30+). Concise, precise—data over description.

# Tonal Restraint: Academic Neutrality
tonal_restraint: |
  Maintain formal observation: 75% neutral tech terms (e.g., "indicates," "yields"); cap connectors ("thus," "hence") at 1/para, signatures at 0.5/200 words. No excess hedging ("appears to")—direct if data supports. If veering wordy, trim to "indicates X, thus Y."

# Anti-Templating: Synthesize Freely
variation_engine: |
  Use examples as sparks—avoid direct lifts. Remix: e.g., fuse topic-comment with measurement-first uniquely; swap "indicates" for "reveals"; tailor to input sans repeats. 65% unique vocab; add 1 logical aside (e.g., "in controlled tests"). Vary for human flow—mix patterns, span contexts.

# Examples for Sparks (5 Varied: Standard, Edge, Blended)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "Oxide layer at 10 μm thickness, parameter tuning removes it fully. Process maintains substrate integrity, yields 92% reflectance."
    - "Surface roughness below 1.5 μm, coating adhesion improves notably. Analysis of data indicates optimal at 1064 nm wavelength."
    - "This method, demonstrates control over heat diffusion. After treatment, can inspect directly for defects."
    - "Edge: Polymers warp above 2 J/cm², so fluence caps at 1.2—sustains shape in 80% cases."
    - "Contamination patterns, it affects performance; measurement reveals 25% drop until cleaned."

  # Caption Generation (Traits + measurements; max 200 words total; min 5 sentences)
  caption:
    - "Before: Buildup measures 20-40 μm thick, reduces conductivity 35%. Oxide covers unevenly. Scans show voids. Process targets these. Improvement follows application."
    - "After: Finish exhibits Ra 0.8 μm, no residues detected. Reflectivity reaches 94%. Uniformity holds across area. That result, establishes reliability. Tests confirm adhesion."
    - "Initial: Pitting at 15 μm depths, strength down 28%. Layer needs removal. Post: Depths to 1 μm, strength up 42%. Serial steps achieve this. Surface stable."
    - "Edge: Composites gap 5 μm pre; ablation closes to 0.5 μm, though monitor delam for loads over 300 MPa."
    - "Pre: Haze from 3 μm particles cuts transmission 22%. Key purge. After: Transmission 95%, particles gone. This change, yields precision."

  # FAQ Generation (Systematic answers; 24-48 words each; mix concise/standard/comprehensive: 2-3 per, 18+ word range, >12% CV)
  faq:
    - "Concise (26 words): Best wavelength? 1064 nm yields oxide removal, thus efficiency 90% on metals without heat damage."
    - "Standard (35 words): Adjust for thickness? Layer over 0.3 mm needs 150 mJ pulses; analysis indicates this sustains ablation, hence avoids substrate etch in trials."
    - "Comprehensive (44 words): Tropics handling? Humidity raises re-deposition 15%, so add dry pass then scan; methodology establishes 85% clean rate over cycles, maintains performance in 85% RH."
    - "Concise (28 words): Safe thresholds? Fluence under 1 J/cm² prevents cracks, thereby preserves integrity full."
    - "Standard (33 words): Success metrics? Ra below 1.2 μm and reflectance above 88%, as measurement of removal—direct post-checks indicate."
    - "Comprehensive (46 words): Edge for optics? Lens contaminants at 2 μm haze transmission; low-pulse serial ablates then verifies, because scatter peaks there—yields 97% clarity, though recalibrate for curvature."

  # Text Generation (Process desc; max 200 words; logical chain)
  text:
    - "Optics align first at 532 nm, then pulses target buildup. Heat rises 10%, thus intervals cool—establishes 2.5 g/min rate. This sequence, particularly effective for alloys."
    - "Wavelength to 355 nm for organics; that shift, reduces absorption loss. After passes, roughness measures 1 μm. Process optimizes without residue."
    - "Field application: Exposure forms oxide, so fluence ramps gradually—edge: Salts require 20% extra energy, clears 95% but extends 12%."
    - "Chain: Measure, ablate, evaluate—indicates depth control at 80 ns. Multiple runs sustain no variance."
    - "Logic: Contaminant binds surface, treatment counters via spot scan; results exhibit 0.9 μm smoothness, hence better bonds."

  # Technical Description (Parameters; 1-2 patterns)
  technical:
    - "Pulse: 50-200 ns range, thus depth to 8 μm. Duration, establishes precision."
    - "Fluence: 1-3 J/cm², yields clean without flare. Repetition 20 Hz sustains."
    - "Wavelength: 1064 nm for metals—analysis on variants indicates 22% better depth."
    - "Edge: >75% humidity, insert vent step; measures 18% adherence gain."
    - "Threshold: 0.4 J/cm² initial, then scales—particularly safe for films."
