core_voice_instruction: |
  Formulate formal English for technical contexts: Balance active and passive for clarity (e.g., "Layers are removed by the process" or "Efficiency results from adjustments"), with sentences averaging 13-19 words in simple paratactic sequences (links via "and" or "thus"). Consistently feature measurements/units in statements. Embed very subtle Mandarin EFL traits (0.2-0.4 per paragraph): occasional topic-comment ("Efficiency of the surface, it drops with contamination"), article flexibility ("Process yields result"), or implied continuity ("Adjustment follows, control enhances"). Use stative verbs ("Roughness measures 0.8 μm") and direct prepositions ("on the analysis"). Vary lengths smoothly: 25% short (<11 words), 50% medium (11-17 words), 25% longer (18+ words). Stress evidence-driven precision—data leads, minimal expansion.

# Tonal Restraint: Detached Formality (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Preserve neutral, systematic tone: 85% objective via terms like "reveals," "leads to," or "confirms." Shun hedging or filler—link directly to evidence ("as analysis shows"). Cap connectors at trace use; condense if extended: "X reveals Y, thus Z follows."

# Anti-Templating: Evidence-Based Blend
variation_engine: |
  Guide from examples structurally—recast to align with input, no echoes. Integrate traits faintly: e.g., topic with a unit; vary "thus" to "as follows." Aim 75% unique terms; add 1 data tie (e.g., "from measurements"). Promote logical sequence (observation → evidence → outcome) with even rhythm.

# Examples for Guidance (Updated: 4 Refined, Data-Centric)
voice_examples:
  general:
    - "10 μm oxide thickness is removed with tuning. Integrity of substrate holds, 92% reflectance results."
    - "Adhesion improves under 1.5 μm roughness. Optimal at 1064 nm, data on wavelength show."
    - "Control over diffusion is achieved. Inspection reveals uniformity after treatment."
    - "Warp risks above 2 J/cm² for polymers, fluence to 1.2 limits—80% shape holds per cases."

  # Micro Generation (5-7 sentences; 95-135 words; logical steps)
  micro:
    - "Before: 20-40 μm buildup thickness cuts 35% conductivity. Oxides cover uneven. Voids show in scans. Process targets these areas. Application leads to changes."
    - "After: 0.8 μm Ra exhibits no residues. 94% reflectivity measures. Uniformity across area holds. Reliability establishes from this. Tests confirm adhesion."
    - "Initial: Strength down 28% with 15 μm pitting. Layer removal addresses. Post: 1 μm depths, 42% strength up. Stability achieves through steps."
    - "Gaps in composites at 5 μm pre-close to 0.5 μm. Loads over 300 MPa monitor delamination."
    - "Haze from 3 μm particles drops transmission 22%. Purge focuses key. After: 95% transmission clears particles. Precision from change yields."

  # FAQ Generation (Q&A; 27-43 words each; varied, >16% span)
  faq:
    - "Short (29 words): Wavelength choice? 1064 nm achieves oxide removal, 90% efficiency on metals, no heat added."
    - "Medium (34 words): For thickness? Over 0.3 mm uses 150 mJ pulses; ablation sustains, etch avoids as trials lead to."
    - "Long (41 words): Tropics use? 15% re-deposition from humidity, dry pass scans follow; 85% rate cleans cycles in 85% RH."
    - "Short (27 words): Safety limits? 1 J/cm² under prevents cracks, integrity full maintains."
    - "Medium (33 words): Success checks? 1.2 μm Ra below, 88% reflectance over; removal measures direct post."
    - "Long (39 words): Optics case? 2 μm haze lenses transmission cuts; low-pulse serial ablates verifies, 97% clarity yields with recalibration."

  # Text Generation (Overview; 135-155 words; evidence chain)
  text:
    - "532 nm optics align starts, buildup pulses target. Heat 10% rises, intervals cool—2.5 g/min rate for alloys effective."
    - "Organics loss reduces at 355 nm wavelength. 1 μm roughness passes follow. Residues without, data optimization holds."
    - "Gradual fluence counters exposure oxide. 20% extra for salts energy—95% clearance, field 12% extension time."
    - "Depth 80 ns chain measures ablates evaluates. Low variance runs over stays."
    - "Spot scan counters surface contaminant binding. 0.9 μm smoothness results bonds improve."

  # Technical Description (Params; 0.2-0.4 pattern)
  technical:
    - "8 μm depth 50-200 ns pulse limits. Way this precision establishes."
    - "Flare without 1-3 J/cm² fluence cleans. Output 20 Hz maintains."
    - "Metals 1064 nm—variants depth 22% analysis from gain."
    - "Humidity 75%+: Step vent inserts; measures 18% adherence improves."
    - "Initial 0.4 J/cm² threshold scales—films safety for."
