NOTE: Anti-AI grammar rules have been moved to the global system prompt (prompts/system/base.txt).
This file is kept for backward compatibility with the prompt_builder.py loading mechanism.
All text components now inherit these rules automatically from base.txt.

For the current comprehensive anti-AI rules, see: prompts/system/base.txt

LEGACY FALLBACK (if base.txt unavailable):
- Avoid: enables, delivers, provides, achieves, demonstrates, facilitates, leverages
- Vary sentence openings and structures
- Use active voice predominantly
- Mix sentence lengths naturally
- Ground statements in specific contexts
