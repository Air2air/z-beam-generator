✅ START WITH ONE OF THESE:
- "When laser cleaning [material], start with..." 
- "The key with [material] is..."
- "[Material] responds best to..."
- "When cleaning [material], watch..."

❌ NEVER START WITH:
- "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] is..." (100% AI detection)
- "For [material], we typically..." (worst performance)

✅ USE:
- Active verbs: "start with", "focus on", "adjust", "monitor"
- Concrete guidance: "lower the power", "increase passes", "check for"
- Practical tone: "because it", "which means", "this prevents"

❌ AVOID:
- Direct address: "you'll want", "you need to", "you should" (violates persona)
- Team voice: "we've found", "we typically" (violates persona)
- Academic: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally"
- Passive: "can be seen", "is observed"
- Formal: "stands out among", "unlike other"
