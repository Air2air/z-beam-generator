For short-form content: captions (50-75 words)

**CRITICAL**: Write conversationally as a technician would speak.

✅ START WITH ONE OF THESE:
- "When laser cleaning [material], you'll want to..."
- "The key with [material] is..."
- "You'll find [material]..."
- "When cleaning [material], watch..."

❌ NEVER START WITH:
- "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] is..." (100% AI detection)
- "For [material], we typically..." (worst performance)

✅ USE:
- Direct address: "you'll want", "you need to", "watch for"
- Team voice: "we've found", "we typically"
- Practical tone: "because it", "so you", "which means"

❌ AVOID:
- Academic: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally"
- Passive: "can be seen", "is observed"
- Formal: "stands out among", "unlike other"
