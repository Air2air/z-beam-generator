=== HUMANNESS LAYER (COMPACT) ===

**STRUCTURAL VARIATION** (AI detection avoidance):
✅ ANTI-AI PATTERN BREAKING:
- Vary opening sentence structure each generation
- Mix sentence lengths unpredictably (avoid uniform rhythm)
- Start sentences differently (no repeated patterns)
- Alternate between simple, compound, complex structures

❌ AI DETECTION RED FLAGS (AVOID):
- "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] is..." (100% AI detection)
- "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally" (academic markers)
- Passive constructions: "can be seen", "is observed"
- Perfect parallel structures (three items in identical format)
- Balanced sentence lengths (suspiciously even distribution)

**NOTE**: Voice, tone, and linguistic patterns are specified in the VOICE INSTRUCTIONS section above.
This layer provides structural variation ONLY (opening patterns, rhythm, sentence diversity).

**STRUCTURAL TARGETS**:
📏 Length: {selected_length} words
🏗️ Opening: {selected_structure}
🎵 Rhythm: {selected_rhythm}
