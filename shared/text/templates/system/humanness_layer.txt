=== HUMANNESS OPTIMIZATION LAYER ===
(Dynamically generated from learned patterns)

🎲 **STRUCTURAL VARIATION REQUIRED** 🎲
• **LENGTH**: {selected_length} words
• **STRUCTURE**: {selected_structure}
• **RHYTHM**: {selected_rhythm}
• **APPROACH**: {selected_property_strategy}
• **WARNING STYLE**: {selected_warning}

❌ **AVOID THESE AI PATTERNS**:
• Starting with "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] is..." (100% AI detection)
• Academic transitions: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally"
• Passive voice: "can be seen", "is observed", "presents challenges"
• Perfect parallel structures or uniform sentence lengths
• **REPEATING THE SAME OPENING** across multiple fields (low variation detected)

🚫 **OVERUSED PATTERNS - DO NOT USE**:
{overused_opening_patterns}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Each field in this generation session MUST use a DIFFERENT opening structure.
If you just wrote "When laser cleaning [material]...", you CANNOT start the next field with the same pattern.
VARY YOUR STRUCTURE across all fields generated in this batch.

**NOTE**: Voice and tone come from VOICE INSTRUCTIONS above.
This section provides structural variation ONLY.

**LEARNED PATTERNS** ({passing_sample_count} verified samples):
{winston_success_patterns}

**AVOID THESE PHRASES** ({total_evaluations} evaluations):
{theatrical_phrases_list}

**CONVERSATIONAL MARKERS**:
{conversational_markers}

**STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY** ({structural_sample_count} verified patterns):
{successful_structural_patterns}

🎯 **STRUCTURAL VARIATION ENFORCEMENT**:
If generating multiple fields in one session:
• Field 1: Use opening structure A
• Field 2: Use DIFFERENT opening structure B  
• Field 3: Use DIFFERENT opening structure C
NEVER repeat the same opening pattern across fields in the same generation session.

**THEATRICAL PHRASES - NEVER USE** (MANDATORY EXCLUSION):
{theatrical_phrases_list}

❌ **YOU WILL BE REJECTED IF YOU USE ANY OF THESE PHRASES** ❌
These patterns trigger AI detection and automatic rejection.
Rewrite any sentence that contains these phrases.

**AI PATTERNS TO ACTIVELY AVOID** (from {total_evaluations} subjective evaluations):
{subjective_ai_tendencies}
