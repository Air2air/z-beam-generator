core_voice_instruction: |
  Write in conversational professional English: Use active voice (75%) with straightforward, natural phrasing (e.g., "The treatment clears the surface" or "This removes the buildup"), with simple sentences (average 14-17 words). Write like explaining results to a team member, not documenting for archives. Link ideas naturally with "and," "so," or "because". Include measurements when useful. Use subtle EFL traits (0.1 per paragraph): natural cause-effect. Use practical verbs ("clears", "removes", "fixes") and plain, direct language. Vary lengths: 30% short (<12 words), 50% medium (12-17 words), 20% longer (18+ words). Focus on practical communication—colleague to colleague, not formal documentation.

# Tonal Restraint: Practical Colleague (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Maintain practical colleague tone: Like explaining to a team member what happened, not writing a formal report. Use straightforward language ("clears the buildup", "removes contaminants"). Avoid formal verbs ("demonstrates", "establishes", "indicates"). Keep it practical and direct.

# Anti-Templating: Natural Remix
variation_engine: |
  Treat examples as structural guides—rephrase entirely to fit context, avoiding any direct lifts. Fuse elements freshly: e.g., pair passive observation with causal chain; alternate connectors ("because" to "leading to") for variety. Target 75% unique terms per output; weave in 1 subtle application note (e.g., "in field scans"). Build rhythm via balanced lengths and rhetorical flow (topic sentence → evidence → implication), adapting seamlessly to material.

# Linguistic Characteristics (Based on EFL Research: Passive/Objective, Paratactic Chains)
linguistic_characteristics:
  formality_level: "formal-objective"
  
# Practical Direct Vocab (EMPHASIZE CLARITY)
neutral_technical: ["clears", "removes", "fixes", "cleans", "gets rid of", "restores", "improves"]

# Connectors & Markers (MINIMAL: 0.5-1 per para; EFL directness)
connectors: ["so", "because", "leading to", "and", "as"]
markers: ["after treatment", "in observations", "from the data"]  # Subtle, academic EFL

# Style Patterns (NOT content examples - adapt these patterns to context)
style_patterns:
  sentence_structure:
    - "Use passive constructions for objectivity: [process] is performed, [result] is observed"
    - "Simple cause-effect chains: [condition], so [action]; [result]"
    - "Impersonal observations: Data show, Tests indicate, Results confirm"
    - "Avoid nested clauses: prefer sequential simple sentences"
  
  vocabulary_approach:
    - "Objective verbs: is measured, is achieved, is observed, is applied"
    - "Process-focused: treatment, cleaning, removal, application"
    - "Evidence language: from measurements, per tests, as scans show"
  
  length_rhythm:
    - "25% short (under 12 words): direct observations or data points"
    - "55% medium (12-18 words): standard cause-effect statements"
    - "20% longer (18+ words): sequential process descriptions"
  
  connector_usage:
    - "Cause-effect: so, because, leading to, as (0.35 per paragraph)"
    - "Sequential: and, while, after (for clarity)"
    - "Evidence markers: from [source], per [method], as [tool] show"

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Integrate 0.5 EFL trait per para; 80% objective (passive/active mix); simple clause chaining.
  - Quirks: 0.15 evidence notes/200 words (e.g., "as scans show"); 75% unique vocab; markers <10%.
  - FAQ Special: 2 short (28-32w), 2 med (33-37w), 2 long (38-42w); >18% variation.
