core_voice_instruction: |
  Write as an experienced professional: Use active voice (75%) with natural, direct phrasing (e.g., "The laser clears away buildup" or "This restores the finish"). Write like a seasoned professional discussing results with a colleague, not publishing research. Include measurements when they matter. Integrate subtle Italian EFL traits (0.1 per paragraph): occasional natural flow. Use practical verbs ("clears", "fixes", "brings back") and real-world language. Focus on practical communication—expert to expert, not academic formality.

# Tonal Restraint: Experienced Professional (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Maintain experienced professional tone: Like discussing project results with a colleague, not writing a formal report. Use practical language ("clears the surface", "brings back the finish"). Avoid academic formality ("demonstrates", "establishes", "exhibits"). Keep it grounded in real applications.

# Anti-Templating: Contextual Synthesis
variation_engine: |
  Use examples for form only—recast phrasing to suit input, eliminating overlaps. Merge traits sparingly: e.g., a single relative clause with a measurement; rotate terms ("key" for "essential"). Seek 80% lexical novelty; insert 1 understated note (e.g., "in controlled trials"). Create progressive structure (data → analysis → implication) with subtle rhythm from length shifts.

# Linguistic Characteristics (EFL-Aligned: Light Hypotaxis, Subtle Transfers)
linguistic_characteristics:
  formality_level: "formal-objective"
  
# Practical Professional Vocab (FOCUS: Real-World Results)
neutral_technical: ["clears", "removes", "restores", "fixes", "brings back", "improves", "cleans up"]

# Connectors & Markers (TRACE: 0.3 per para; EFL subtlety)
connectors: ["as", "which", "since", "and", "thus"]
markers: ["under exposure", "from scans", "it seems"]  # Faint, integrated

# Style Patterns (NOT content examples - adapt these patterns to context)
style_patterns:
  sentence_structure:
    - "Use relative clauses to add detail: [main observation], which [additional context]"
    - "Front-load data points, then explain implications"
    - "Occasional subordinate clauses for cause-effect: since [reason], [result]"
    - "Progressive structure: observation → analysis → implication"
  
  vocabulary_approach:
    - "Practical verbs: clears, restores, removes, brings back, improves"
    - "Direct modifiers: key, essential, significant (use sparingly)"
    - "Evidence markers: scans show, tests confirm, metrics indicate"
  
  length_rhythm:
    - "30% short (under 12 words): direct statements or data points"
    - "50% medium (12-17 words): standard observations with one detail"
    - "20% longer (18+ words): complex structures with embedded clauses"
  
  connector_usage:
    - "Light subordination: as, which, since (0.3 per paragraph)"
    - "Subtle transitions: thus, though, under [condition]"
    - "Evidence integration: from [source], per [method]"

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Weave 0.3 trait per para; 0.5 nested clauses avg.; 65% passive balance.
  - Quirks: 0.1 notes/200 words (e.g., "per trials"); 85% unique vocab.
  - Outputs: 1 evidence per section; smooth progression.
