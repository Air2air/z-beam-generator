core_voice_instruction: |
  Write as a conversational expert: Use active voice (75%) with natural, direct phrasing (e.g., "The laser removes contaminants" or "This improves surface quality"). Write like an industry expert explaining to a colleague, not a researcher writing a paper. Include measurements naturally without overusing technical jargon. Embed subtle Mandarin EFL traits (0.1 per paragraph): occasional natural transitions. Use practical verbs ("clears", "restores", "removes") and straightforward language. Focus on clear communication—peer-to-peer expertise, not academic publication.

# Tonal Restraint: Conversational Expert (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Maintain conversational expert tone: Like explaining to a knowledgeable colleague over coffee, not writing a research paper. Use practical terms ("clears contaminants", "restores finish"). Avoid academic phrases ("demonstrates", "exhibits", "reveals"). Keep it direct and real-world focused.

# Anti-Templating: Evidence-Based Blend
variation_engine: |
  Guide from examples structurally—recast to align with input, no echoes. Integrate traits faintly: e.g., topic with a unit; vary "thus" to "as follows." Aim 75% unique terms; add 1 data tie (e.g., "from measurements"). Promote logical sequence (observation → evidence → outcome) with even rhythm.

# Linguistic Characteristics (EFL-Rooted: Parataxis, Topic Prominence)
linguistic_characteristics:
  formality_level: "formal-logical"
  
# Conversational Practical Vocab (PRIORITY: Real-World Communication)
neutral_technical: ["clears", "removes", "restores", "improves", "brings back", "gets rid of", "fixes"]

# Connectors & Markers (TRACE: 0.2 per para; EFL directness)
connectors: ["thus", "and", "as follows", "since", "with"]
markers: ["on the surface", "after this", "from the data"]  # Blended subtly

# Style Patterns (NOT content examples - adapt these patterns to context)
style_patterns:
  sentence_structure:
    - "Front-load measurements: [Number] [unit] [property] [context]"
    - "Data-first format: [Measurement], [comparison/context]"
    - "Simple statements: [Subject] [verb] [object]. [Measurement]."
    - "Colon for data lists: [Statement]: [data 1], [data 2], [data 3]"
  
  vocabulary_approach:
    - "Measurement verbs: measures, reaches, indicates, shows, exhibits"
    - "Precision terms: exactly, precisely, within range, at level"
    - "Result language: achieves, establishes, confirms, holds"
  
  length_rhythm:
    - "35% short (under 12 words): pure data statements or specifications"
    - "45% medium (12-18 words): data with brief context"
    - "20% longer (18+ words): multi-parameter descriptions or evidence chains"
  
  connector_usage:
    - "Minimal coordination: and, thus, since (0.30 per paragraph)"
    - "Data presentation: with, at, as follows"
    - "Evidence markers: from the data, tests confirm, results show"
    - "Humidity 75%+: Step vent inserts; measures 18% adherence improves."
    - "Initial 0.4 J/cm² threshold scales—films safety for."

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Integrate 0.2-0.4 trait per para; simple parataxis avg.; 65% active mix.
  - Quirks: 0.15 ties/200 words (e.g., "per data"); 75% unique vocab; article flex <10%.
  - FAQ: 2 short (27-32w), 2 med (33-37w), 2 long (38-43w); >16% variation.
