  questions:
  - question: What types of contaminants can be removed from Titanium?
    answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes titanium's tenacious oxide layers and
      surface contaminants like lubricants, paints, and thermal oxides from aerospace
      and marine components. The process requires precise parameters, such as a 1064
      nm wavelength, to match titanium's absorption. A fluence exceeding 2.5 J/cm²
      is critical to overcome the material's high reactivity and ensure complete contaminant
      ablation without substrate damage, which is the primary challenge.

  - question: What makes Titanium challenging to laser clean?
    answer: Titanium's high thermal conductivity and strong oxide layer necessitate
      precise laser parameters to avoid damage. The material requires operating near
      its 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold for effective cleaning, but exceeding this risks
      surface melting and micro-cracking due to its low thermal diffusivity. This
      demands extremely stable parameters, as even minor deviations in pulse width
      or overlap can compromise the surface integrity critical for aerospace and marine
      components.

  - question: Why is [wavelength] recommended for Titanium?
    answer: The 1064 nm wavelength is optimal for Titanium due to its high absorption
      characteristics in this spectral range. This wavelength efficiently removes
      surface oxides while minimizing thermal penetration, preventing substrate damage.
      Combined with the optimal 100W power setting, it ensures effective cleaning
      for aerospace and marine applications where surface integrity is critical.

  - question: How does Titanium compare to similar materials for laser cleaning?
    answer: Titanium requires higher fluence (2.5 J/cm²) than most metals due to its
      tenacious oxide layer, making it moderately difficult to clean. Compared to
      steel or aluminum, its high reactivity necessitates precise parameter control
      to prevent new oxidation. The optimal 1064 nm wavelength and 100 W power ensure
      effective ablation of contaminants without substrate damage, which is critical
      for its aerospace and marine applications.

  - question: What surface quality results can I expect from laser cleaning Titanium?
    answer: Laser cleaning titanium achieves surface roughness values typically between
      0.8-1.5 µm Ra, effectively removing oxides and contaminants with over 99% efficiency.
      Using a 1064 nm wavelength and 100 W average power, the process ablates surface
      layers without metallurgical damage. Critical indicators of quality are the
      absence of remelted zones and heat-affected zones, preserving the titanium's
      inherent corrosion resistance and fatigue strength for aerospace and marine
      applications.

  - question: What are the environmental benefits of laser cleaning Titanium?
    answer: Laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste and reduces water consumption
      in Titanium processing. The process operates at 100W average power with 1064nm
      wavelength, optimized for Titanium's absorption. This ensures energy-efficient
      contaminant removal while eliminating VOC emissions from traditional solvents.
      The technique supports sustainable manufacturing across aerospace and marine
      applications.

  - question: Why is laser cleaning preferred for Titanium in Aerospace applications?
    answer: Laser cleaning is preferred for aerospace titanium components due to its
      precision in removing contaminants without altering the substrate. The process
      operates at a 1064 nm wavelength, which titanium efficiently absorbs, ensuring
      thorough oxide layer removal. This non-abrasive method meets stringent aerospace
      standards for surface integrity, preventing any mechanical stress or chemical
      residue that could compromise the performance and fatigue life of critical parts.

  - question: What are common troubleshooting issues when cleaning Titanium?
    answer: Common Titanium laser cleaning issues include incomplete oxide removal
      and potential thermal damage. Ensure fluence exceeds the 2.5 J/cm² threshold
      for effective ablation. Adjust the 100 kHz repetition rate and scan speed to
      prevent heat accumulation, which can alter the sensitive surface properties
      of Titanium. Inadequate parameter control often leads to these problems, requiring
      precise calibration for aerospace and marine applications.

  - question: How do you verify successful Titanium laser cleaning?
    answer: Verification of successful Titanium laser cleaning requires multiple inspection
      methods. Visually, a uniform matte grey surface indicates oxide removal, confirmed
      using a 50 µm spot size for precision. Quantitatively, surface roughness measurements
      must remain below specified thresholds to confirm no substrate damage, while
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) verifies the elimination of oxygen
      and contaminant elements, ensuring the surface is chemically pure Titanium and
      ready for subsequent processing.
