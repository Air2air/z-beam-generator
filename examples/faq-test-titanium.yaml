  questions:
  - question: How much does it cost to laser clean Titanium?
    answer: Laser cleaning titanium typically costs $50-150 per square meter, depending
      on oxide thickness and part geometry. The optimal 100W average power at 1064nm
      wavelength efficiently removes contaminants while preserving the titanium substrate.
      This represents significant long-term savings versus chemical or abrasive methods
      through reduced consumables, waste disposal, and labor requirements, particularly
      in aerospace applications where surface integrity is critical.

  - question: What laser power works best for Titanium?
    answer: For Titanium laser cleaning, the optimal power typically centers around
      100W. This setting, combined with a 10ns pulse width, effectively removes oxides
      and contaminants without causing thermal damage to the underlying substrate.
      Exceeding this range risks surface melting, while insufficient power will fail
      to achieve the required 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold for adequate ablation.

  - question: How does heat affect Titanium during laser cleaning?
    answer: Titanium's thermal sensitivity requires careful heat management during
      laser cleaning. The optimal 10 ns pulse width enables effective oxide removal
      while minimizing thermal penetration. Maintaining controlled energy input prevents
      microstructural alterations and preserves Titanium's corrosion resistance in
      critical aerospace applications.

  - question: What temperature considerations exist for Titanium?
    answer: Titanium's low thermal conductivity necessitates careful heat management
      during laser cleaning. Maintain the optimal 10 ns pulse width to achieve precise
      ablation while preventing thermal accumulation. Effective cooling strategies
      are essential to preserve Titanium's metallurgical properties throughout the
      process.

  - question: Why does Titanium's reflectivity matter for laser cleaning?
    answer: Titanium's high reflectivity at 1064 nm wavelength significantly impacts
      laser cleaning efficiency, as excessive reflection reduces energy absorption
      into surface contaminants. This necessitates precise fluence control exceeding
      2.5 J/cm² to overcome reflectivity and ensure effective ablation of oxides and
      impurities. Consequently, wavelength selection and power settings must be optimized
      to maximize absorption for a successful cleaning process on titanium components.

  - question: What physical properties make Titanium unique for cleaning?
    answer: Titanium's relatively low density and high hardness necessitate precise
      laser parameters to avoid substrate damage. Its strong absorption at the 1064
      nm wavelength ensures efficient energy transfer for contaminant removal. The
      material's tenacious oxide layer requires a fluence threshold exceeding 2.5
      J/cm² for effective ablation without compromising the underlying integrity.

  - question: Is Titanium fragile during laser cleaning?
    answer: Titanium maintains structural integrity during laser cleaning when using
      proper parameters like the optimal 100W power range. Its inherent brittleness
      requires careful handling with precise 10ns pulse widths to prevent thermal
      stress. Following these controlled settings ensures safe, effective oxide removal
      without compromising the material.

  - question: What strength characteristics affect Titanium cleaning?
    answer: Titanium's mechanical properties significantly influence laser cleaning
      effectiveness. The material's damage resistance requires precise fluence control,
      optimally at 2.5 J/cm², to remove oxides without substrate compromise. Its durability
      permits multiple passes, with 3 being ideal, ensuring thorough decontamination
      while preserving the component's structural integrity for demanding aerospace
      and marine applications.

  - question: What unusual behaviors does Titanium exhibit during cleaning?
    answer: Titanium exhibits unusual transient rainbow oxidation when laser-cleaned
      near its 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold, a phenomenon not seen in most metals.
      This colorful interference effect indicates the formation of a thin, controlled
      oxide layer, which can be desirable for specific applications requiring enhanced
      surface properties. The effect is highly dependent on precise parameter control,
      particularly pulse width and overlap ratio.
