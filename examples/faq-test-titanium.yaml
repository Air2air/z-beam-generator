  questions:
  - question: How much does it cost to laser clean Titanium?
    answer: Laser cleaning titanium typically costs $50-150 per square meter, depending
      on oxide thickness and part geometry. For optimal titanium processing, we use
      100W average power at 1064nm wavelength with 50μm spot size and 500mm/s scan
      speed. This delivers superior ROI versus chemical or abrasive methods by eliminating
      consumables and reducing processing time by 60-80% while preserving the titanium
      substrate integrity.

  - question: What laser power works best for Titanium?
    answer: For Titanium laser cleaning, we typically recommend around 100 W average
      power. This level, combined with a 10 ns pulse width, effectively removes oxides
      and contaminants without causing thermal damage to the underlying substrate.
      Exceeding this power can lead to surface melting, while insufficient power will
      fail to achieve the required 2.5 J/cm² fluence for proper ablation.

  - question: Can laser cleaning damage Titanium?
    answer: Yes, laser cleaning can damage Titanium if incorrect parameters are used.
      Exceeding the optimal fluence threshold of 2.5 J/cm² can cause surface melting
      and micro-cracks. To prevent this, always adhere to the recommended settings,
      such as a 100W average power and 10ns pulse width, and conduct a test on an
      inconspicuous area first. Warning signs include discoloration, a rough texture,

  - question: What's the fastest way to laser clean Titanium?
    answer: For maximum Titanium laser cleaning speed, optimize scan speed while maintaining
      the critical 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold. Using a 100W laser at 500 mm/s with
      a 50% overlap provides the fastest, most productive throughput for aerospace
      and marine components without causing substrate damage. This balances high-speed
      scanning with effective oxide layer removal in a single, efficient process.

  - question: Is laser cleaning Titanium safe?
    answer: Laser cleaning titanium is safe when proper protocols are followed. Using
      the optimal 1064 nm wavelength and a controlled pulse width of 10 ns effectively
      ablates contaminants while minimizing thermal input to the base material. Essential
      safety measures include wearing appropriate laser safety eyewear and ensuring
      adequate fume extraction to mitigate hazards from reflected beams and ejected
      particles.

  - question: How long does laser cleaning Titanium take?
    answer: Laser cleaning titanium typically requires 3 passes at 500 mm/s scanning
      speed for thorough oxide removal. The 50 μm spot size and optimal overlap ratio
      ensure complete coverage. Processing time depends directly on surface area,
      with most aerospace components cleaning in minutes rather than hours.

  - question: What maintenance does Titanium need after laser cleaning?
    answer: After laser cleaning at 100W optimal power, titanium requires immediate
      protective measures. Apply a passivation coating to restore corrosion resistance,
      particularly for aerospace and marine applications. Proper storage in low-humidity
      environments is essential to prevent oxide reformation before component assembly.

  - question: When should I avoid laser cleaning Titanium?
    answer: Avoid laser cleaning titanium when surface temperatures exceed 150°C or
      on thin-walled sections below 1mm, as the thermal input can compromise material
      integrity. The process is also contraindicated for removing deeply embedded
      contaminants or when a sub-micron surface finish is required, as the standard
      100W power setting may induce micro-roughness. For these specific scenarios,
      mechanical abrasion or chemical etching are often superior alternatives to prevent
      any risk of thermal distortion or hydrogen embrittlement. Always validate the
      procedure on a non-critical area first

  - question: What training is needed for laser cleaning Titanium?
    answer: Operators require comprehensive training in laser parameters specific
      to Titanium's high reactivity. Essential training covers setting the optimal
      1064 nm wavelength and a 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold to remove oxides without
      substrate damage. Certification should validate proficiency in these settings
      for critical applications like aerospace, ensuring surface integrity is maintained.
      This foundational knowledge is non-negotiable for quality results.
