  questions:
    - question: What types of contaminants can be removed from Alabaster? # Question should be material-specific and include material name
      answer: Alabaster surfaces commonly accumulate calcium carbonate deposits, gypsum residues, organic staining from environmental exposure, and particulate matter from atmospheric pollution. Laser cleaning effectively removes these contaminants while preserving the stone's delicate translucent structure. The material's density of 2.32 g/cm³ and moderate hardness allow for precise contaminant removal without substrate damage, making it ideal for heritage conservation applications where traditional chemical cleaning could cause irreversible etching.

    - question: What makes Alabaster challenging to laser clean?
      answer: Alabaster's inherent softness (hardness range 1.5-6.0 on various scales) and fine crystalline structure require precise laser parameter control to avoid surface damage. The material's high laser absorption of 85% at 1064nm wavelength means energy must be carefully managed to prevent thermal shock or microcracking. Additionally, Alabaster's thermal conductivity influences heat dissipation patterns, requiring operators to monitor surface temperature and adjust fluence levels based on the specific variety (gypsum vs calcite alabaster) being cleaned.

    - question: Why is 1064 nm wavelength recommended for Alabaster?
      answer: The 1064 nm Nd:YAG wavelength provides optimal balance for Alabaster cleaning due to the material's 85% absorption coefficient at this wavelength. This high absorption enables efficient energy transfer for contaminant removal while the wavelength's penetration depth characteristics minimize subsurface heating. Combined with Alabaster's reflectivity properties, 1064nm allows for controlled ablation of surface contaminants without excessive heat accumulation that could damage the delicate stone matrix or alter its natural coloration.

    - question: Why is laser cleaning preferred for Alabaster in Cultural Heritage applications?
      answer: In cultural heritage conservation, Alabaster's historical and artistic significance demands non-invasive cleaning methods that preserve original surfaces. Laser cleaning offers unmatched selectivity, removing centuries of contamination while maintaining the stone's natural translucency and fine surface details. Unlike chemical treatments that can penetrate porous alabaster and cause long-term degradation, laser cleaning provides immediate, controllable results with no residual chemicals. This is critical for museum artifacts, architectural elements, and sculptures where preservation of authentic material is paramount.

    - question: How does Alabaster compare to similar materials for laser cleaning?
      answer: Compared to other stone materials in its category, Alabaster occupies a middle ground in cleaning difficulty. Its density of 2.32 g/cm³ is lower than harder stones like granite (2.6-2.8 g/cm³), making it more responsive to laser energy but also more susceptible to damage. Marble, with similar calcium-based composition, requires comparable parameter ranges, while harder stones like basalt need significantly higher fluence levels. Alabaster's unique translucency and fine grain structure demand more conservative cleaning approaches than opaque stones of similar hardness.

    - question: What surface quality results can I expect from laser cleaning Alabaster?
      answer: Properly parameterized laser cleaning restores Alabaster to its natural appearance, revealing the stone's characteristic translucency and subtle color variations. Surface roughness remains within acceptable limits (typically maintaining or slightly improving pre-cleaning values), while contaminant removal efficiency reaches 95-99% depending on contamination type. Microscopic analysis shows intact crystalline structure with no thermal alteration or microcracking when optimal parameters (30-65W average power range, appropriate fluence) are maintained. The cleaned surface exhibits improved light transmission and color uniformity compared to contaminated areas.

    - question: What are the environmental benefits of laser cleaning Alabaster?
      answer: Laser cleaning of Alabaster eliminates hazardous chemical waste streams entirely, avoiding acids or solvents that would require specialized disposal and pose environmental risks. The process reduces water consumption by 100% compared to traditional wet cleaning methods, a critical advantage in water-scarce regions or for large conservation projects. With no VOC emissions and minimal energy consumption (focused laser delivery vs extensive mechanical or chemical processing), laser cleaning significantly reduces the carbon footprint of Alabaster conservation and restoration work across all applicable industries.
