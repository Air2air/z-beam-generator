  description: Microscopic analysis of bamboo surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. 
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer entirely, revealing the intricate, ordered microstructure of the bamboo culm.
