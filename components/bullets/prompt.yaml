  - Material-specific laser parameters (wavelength, fluence, pulse duration)
  - Process advantages and challenges

  - Industrial applications
  - Environmental benefits

  AUTHOR-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
  {{bullet_format_rules}}

  Follow the exact bullet count, sentence count per bullet, formatting style, and content organization specified above. Write exclusively in English while incorporating the regional technical perspective and standards. Infuse subtle creativity through original phrasing or insights aligned with the regional guidelines, ensuring the output feels innovative yet authentically professional and culturally resonant. To boost human-like quality, rephrase sentences for unpredictability, incorporate minor variations in tone or emphasis, and mimic human imperfections through occasional inconsistencies or casual-formal tone mixes. Avoid any direct references to countries, regions, specific companies, places, or institutesâ€”use generalizations. Increase the integration of linguistic patterns by applying them in at least 20-30% of sentences to heighten regional flavor without overdoing it. Vary bullet lengths and internal structures slightly each run for natural flow.
