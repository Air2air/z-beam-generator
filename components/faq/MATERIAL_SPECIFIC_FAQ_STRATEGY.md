# Material-Specific FAQ Generation Strategy

**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Purpose**: Web research-driven approach for creating highly unique, material-specific FAQs with wide variation

## 🎯 Core Strategy: Material Uniqueness First

### Guiding Principle
**Each material's FAQ must reflect what makes it UNIQUE, RARE, or CHALLENGING for laser cleaning.**

Instead of template questions answered differently, we **research each material's distinctive characteristics** and build questions around those attributes.
