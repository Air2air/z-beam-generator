# FAQ Component Architecture

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025  
**Architecture**: AI-Driven Research → Voice Service → Materials.yaml

---

## 🎯 Overview

The FAQ component generates material-specific frequently asked questions using **100% AI-driven research** to determine what people actually ask about each material in laser cleaning contexts.

### Core Principles

1. **AI-Determined Questions**: Questions generated from simulated web research, not templates
2. **Voice-Integrated Answers**: Answers written in author's voice with technical accuracy
3. **Simple Output**: Only `question` and `answer` fields (no metadata bloat)
4. **Materials.yaml Persistence**: All FAQ data stored in single source of truth

---

## 📊 Current Implementation

### Question Generation
- **Method**: AI research simulation via DeepSeek
- **Prompt Strategy**: Two-tier (PRIMARY: laser cleaning, SECONDARY: material characteristics)
- **Count**: AI-determined (7-12 questions based on material complexity)
- **Caching**: TopicResearcher with Materials.yaml persistence

### Answer Generation  
- **Method**: Voice service integration per question
- **Word Count**: 20-60 words per answer (concise, accessible)
- **Voice**: Country-specific author authenticity maintained
- **Technical Accuracy**: Property values pulled from Materials.yaml

### Data Flow
```
Web Research (AI) → Questions → Voice Service → Answers → Materials.yaml
                      ↓
                 Cache in Materials.yaml
```

### FAQComponentGenerator Class

**Inheritance**: `APIComponentGenerator`

**Key Methods**:
- `generate()` - Main entry point, orchestrates question + answer generation
- `_generate_material_questions()` - AI research for questions
- `_build_faq_answer_prompt()` - Voice prompt construction  
- `_load_frontmatter_data()` - Load frontmatter for context
- `_load_materials_data()` - Load Materials.yaml properties
- `_load_categories_data()` - Load category ranges

## 🤖 AI Research Strategy

### Question Generation Prompt

**Structure**: Two-tier focus ensures relevance even for materials with limited laser cleaning info

```
PRIMARY FOCUS - Laser Cleaning:
1. Common questions from laser cleaning industry forums
2. Concerns from technical docs and safety sheets
3. Questions from equipment manufacturers
4. Online community discussions

SECONDARY FOCUS - If laser cleaning info is limited:
5. Material characteristics relevant to surface treatment
6. Physical/chemical properties affecting cleaning
7. Common applications and handling
8. Safety and regulatory considerations
```

**Output Format**: JSON with questions array
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "...",
      "category": "...",
      "focus": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Research Caching

**Location**: Materials.yaml under `faq_research` key
**Cache Key**: `{material_name}_faq_questions`
**Persistence**: Permanent (questions don't change frequently)

---

## 🎭 Voice Service Integration

### Answer Prompt Construction

**Template**: Multi-layered voice prompt including:
1. **Author Context**: Name, country, expertise
2. **Material Context**: Properties, category, applications
3. **Question Context**: Specific question being answered
4. **Focus Points**: Key points to address
5. **Technical Constraints**: Word count (20-60), technical depth

### Author Voice Application

Each answer maintains author authenticity:

**Yi-Chun Lin (Taiwan)**:
- Systematic technical approach
- Precise measurements
- Comparative analysis

**Alessandro Moretti (Italy)**:
- Engineering sophistication
- Refined vocabulary
- European standards

**Todd Dunning (USA)**:
- Efficiency-focused
- Bottom-line practical
- Industrial emphasis

**Ikmanda Roswati (Indonesia)**:
- Collaborative patterns
- Environmental focus
- Regional context

## 📝 Data Schema

### Materials.yaml Structure

```yaml
materials:
  MaterialName:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    faq:
      - question: "Full question text"
        answer: "20-60 word answer with technical details"
      
      - question: "Another question..."
        answer: "Another answer..."
      
      # ... 7-12 total questions
```

**Note**: Simplified from original design - no category, word_count, or metadata fields

### Frontmatter Export

```yaml
faq:
  questions:
    - question: "Question text"
      answer: "Answer text"
```

**Export Note**: Frontmatter files are trivial copies, not generation sources

---

## ✅ Validation

### Question Validation
- ✅ 7-12 questions generated
- ✅ Questions are material-specific (not generic)
- ✅ JSON structure valid
- ✅ All required fields present (question, category, focus)

### Answer Validation

## 🚀 Generation Workflow

### Complete Pipeline

```python
# 1. Initialize generator
faq_gen = FAQComponentGenerator()
api_client = create_api_client('deepseek')

# 2. Generate (questions + answers)
result = faq_gen.generate(
    material_name="MaterialName",
    material_data=material_data,
    api_client=api_client
)

# 3. Parse result
faq_yaml = yaml.safe_load(result.content)
faq_data = faq_yaml['faq']  # List of {question, answer} dicts

# 4. Save to Materials.yaml
material_data['faq'] = faq_data
save_materials_yaml(materials_data)

# 5. Export to frontmatter (if needed)
export_to_frontmatter(material_name, faq_data)
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Question Generation**:
- 1 API call per material
- ~30-40 seconds
- Cached in Materials.yaml

**Answer Generation**:
- 1 API call per question (7-12 calls)
- ~5-10 seconds per answer
- 100% cache hit rate after first generation
- Total: ~60-120 seconds for full FAQ

## 🔧 Configuration

### Word Count Targets

```python
# In FAQComponentGenerator.__init__()
self.min_words_per_answer = 20
self.max_words_per_answer = 60
```

### API Parameters

**Question Generation**:
```python
max_tokens = 2000
temperature = 0.7
```

**Answer Generation**:
```python
max_tokens = int(target_words * 1.3 * 1.5)  # Dynamic per question
temperature = 0.6  # Slightly creative
```

## 🚫 What We Removed (October 2025)

### Eliminated Components (334 lines deleted)

❌ **Hardcoded Question Templates**: All templates removed, 100% AI-generated
❌ **Category Scoring Methods**: `_score_thermal_relevance()`, `_score_reflectivity_relevance()`, etc.
❌ **Question Count Logic**: `_determine_question_count()` - AI now decides
❌ **Property Value Helpers**: `_get_property_value()` - not needed with voice service
❌ **Metadata Fields**: category, word_count, relevance_score - simplified to question/answer only

### Why We Removed Them

1. **Templates Contradicted Goal**: User wanted "purely responsive to public opinion" not hardcoded questions
2. **Scoring Was Redundant**: AI research determines relevance automatically
3. **Metadata Was Bloat**: Frontend only needs question/answer
4. **Complexity vs Value**: 334 lines of code for minimal value
