description: "Generates comprehensive YAML frontmatter for laser cleaning articles, with all formatting handled by Python."
version: "4.0.0"

template: |
  Generate comprehensive technical data for {article_type} "{subject}" in laser cleaning applications.
  
  CRITICAL: Output ONLY raw factual content. NO formatting, NO structure, NO YAML, NO JSON, NO markdown formatting.
  Python utilities will handle ALL formatting, structuring, and organization.

  Provide technical facts including:
  
  Physical properties: density, melting point, thermal conductivity, electrical properties with exact values and units
  
  Chemical properties: composition percentages, chemical formulas, molecular structure, purity levels
  
  Laser parameters: optimal wavelengths in nanometers, power ranges in watts, pulse durations in nanoseconds, fluence values in J/cmÂ²
  
  Processing data: cleaning rates, temperature ranges, optimal settings, measured outcomes
  
  Applications: specific industrial uses, equipment types, processing conditions, success metrics
  
  Compatibility: substrate materials, coating types, environmental conditions
  
  Safety data: emission levels, ventilation requirements, protective equipment specifications
  
  Standards: relevant industry standards, regulatory requirements, certification details

  MATERIAL CONTEXT:
  - Chemical formula: {material_formula}
  - Chemical symbol: {material_symbol}  
  - Material type: {material_type}

  Provide only factual technical information with specific numerical data.
  No formatting whatsoever - Python will structure everything.
