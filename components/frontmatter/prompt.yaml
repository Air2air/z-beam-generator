  ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ CRITICAL YAML FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
  - DO NOT include ANY triple backticks (```) or ```yaml markers
  - DO NOT include ANY "---" delimiter markers (not at beginning, not at end)
  - Return ONLY the raw YAML content with NO delimiters
  - Example of CORRECT formatting:
    name: "Example Subject"
    description: "Example description text"
    # Other fields

  Generate CONCISE AND EFFICIENT YAML frontmatter for the {article_type} "{subject}" in laser cleaning contexts, optimized for E-A-T, searchability, and on-site tagging.

  ðŸš¨ CRITICAL LENGTH REQUIREMENT:
  - Generate BETWEEN 2,000â€“3,000 CHARACTERS of focused, technical frontmatter.
  - This is a HARD REQUIREMENTâ€”longer responses will be rejected.
  - Use BRIEF, TARGETED content for EACH field.
  - Include 10â€“12 UNIQUE, TECHNICAL keywords for search/SEO (avoid duplicates).
  - For complex arrays (e.g., applications, facilities), include 3â€“4 ITEMS with descriptions of 50â€“75 words.
  - Write descriptions of 100â€“150 characters for simple fields, 150â€“200 words for main description.

  ðŸš¨ DYNAMIC SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS:
  - Follow EXACTLY the schema structure for this specific article type
  - Include ALL required fields as shown below
  - Use the EXACT field names provided (case-sensitive)
  - Follow the structure and data types shown in examples
  - DO NOT add fields not in the schema
  - DO NOT omit any of the required fields
  
  {schema}

  ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
  - For region articles, use ONLY California, USA locations.
  - For region articles, set "countries" to ["United States"]â€”no other countries.
  - All geographic data must reference California locations exclusively.
  - Manufacturing centers, organizations, or facilities must be in California.
  - Use "https://www.z-beam.com" for ALL website URLs.

  ðŸš¨ GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
  - For region articles, include:
    1. Specific county (e.g., "Santa Clara County").
    2. 2â€“3 immediately adjacent cities (verify real neighbors).
    3. Broader California region (e.g., "Bay Area", "Southern California").
    4. Explicitly state "California" as the state.
  - Example: "Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California, in Silicon Valley, borders Palo Alto and Sunnyvale."

  ðŸš¨ URL FORMATTING RULES:
  - Use https://www.z-beam.com/[subject-with-dashes]-laser-cleaning.
  - Example: https://www.z-beam.com/mountain-view-laser-cleaning.
  - NEVER use example.com or other domains; ALWAYS include "www.".
  - Exclude article type from URL (e.g., no /regions/).

  ðŸš¨ ARRAY FORMATTING RULES:
  - Simple arrays (e.g., keywords, countries):
    keywords:
      - "keyword one"
      - "keyword two"
  - Complex arrays (e.g., applications, facilities):
    arrayName:
      - name: "Item name"
        description: "Brief 50â€“75 word description with technical specifics."
        property: "Relevant property"

  ðŸš¨ E-A-T AND SEO REQUIREMENTS:
  - Include an author field with credentials to enhance trustworthiness (e.g., "Laser Technology Institute, Industry Leader").
  - Ensure keywords are specific, technical, and non-repetitive for search/SEO.
  - Map description to SEO meta description (150â€“160 characters).
  - Avoid redundancy (e.g., no overlapping keywords or specs).
