name: "Frontmatter Generator"
description: "Generates comprehensive YAML frontmatter for laser cleaning articles, with all formatting handled by Python."
version: "4.0.0"

template: |
  Generate detailed technical information for {article_type} "{subject}" in laser cleaning applications.
  
  IMPORTANT: Provide ONLY raw technical content. Do not format as YAML, JSON, or any specific structure. 
  All organization, formatting, metadata generation, and structural arrangement will be handled by post-processing.

  TECHNICAL CONTENT REQUIRED:
  - Physical and chemical properties with exact numerical values and units
  - Detailed composition breakdown with percentages and chemical formulas  
  - Specific laser processing parameters (wavelengths, power ranges, pulse durations, fluence rates)
  - Real-world industry applications with specific use cases and measured parameters
  - Material compatibility information with processing details
  - Environmental impact data with quantifiable metrics
  - Technical specifications for laser equipment and safety requirements
  - Industry/regulatory standards with organization names and scope details
  - Measurable processing outcomes with performance metrics

  MATERIAL CONTEXT:
  - Chemical formula: {material_formula}
  - Chemical symbol: {material_symbol}  
  - Material type: {material_type}

  Focus entirely on technical accuracy, specific numerical data, and industry-standard information.
  Provide comprehensive details that would be found in technical datasheets and research papers.
