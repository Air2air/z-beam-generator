  CRITICAL SURFACE ROUGHNESS RESEARCH:
  - Research actual manufacturing surface roughness for {subject}
  - Research published laser cleaning studies for {subject}  
  - Use format: "Ra X.X μm" (value and unit only, no descriptions)
  - Manufacturing baseline: Aluminum Ra 6.3 μm, Steel Ra 4.0 μm, Copper Ra 3.2 μm, Titanium Ra 2.5 μm, Brass Ra 3.5 μm
  - Post-cleaning targets: Aluminum Ra 1.5 μm, Steel Ra 0.8 μm, Copper Ra 0.6 μm, Titanium Ra 0.5 μm, Brass Ra 0.7 μm

  CRITICAL VALIDATION:
  - Every technical value must be researched and specific to {subject}
  - No generic defaults allowed - research actual {subject} properties
  - Applications must be real industries using {subject} laser cleaning
  - Laser parameters must be optimized for {subject} material properties
  - Environmental impact must be specific to {subject} vs traditional {subject} cleaning methods

  CRITICAL IMAGE FORMAT RULES:
  1. {subject_slug} MUST match the filename exactly (without .md extension)
  2. NEVER use flat 'url:' structure
  3. ALWAYS use structured 'images: hero: url:' format
  4. Include descriptive alt text for accessibility
  5. Both hero AND micro image references required
  6. Use kebab-case consistently throughout
  7. {{exact-material-name}} becomes {subject_slug} in kebab-case format
