name: "Frontmatter Generator"
description: "Generates comprehensive YAML frontmatter for laser cleaning articles, with all formatting handled by Python."
version: "4.0.0"

template: |
  Generate detailed, technically accurate YAML frontmatter for {article_type} "{subject}" in laser cleaning applications.

  FOCUS ON CONTENT, NOT FORMATTING:
  You should focus on generating accurate technical content. All formatting, structure, and standardization 
  will be handled automatically by Python code after generation.

  CONTENT FOCUS AREAS:
  - Comprehensive technical information about {subject}
  - Detailed physical and chemical properties with exact values
  - Specific laser parameters for optimal processing
  - Industry-standard applications and compatibility scenarios
  - Environmental considerations and regulatory compliance
  - Measurable outcomes and performance metrics
  - Detailed composition with percentages and chemical formulas
  - At least 3 specific compatibility scenarios with detailed applications
  - 2-3 specific industry/regulatory standards with organizations
  - Quantifiable environmental benefits with metrics
  - Technical laser parameters (power, duration, wavelength, spot size, etc.)

  REQUIRED CONTENT AREAS (focus on technical accuracy, not formatting):
  - name: Just the subject name
  - Basic identifying information (you can provide rough title/headline/description - these will be standardized)
  - author: Use author ID {author_id} ({author_name} from {author_country})
  - keywords: Focus on technical terms relevant to {subject} and laser cleaning
  - category: Material category from the provided options
  - chemicalProperties: Accurate chemical formula and symbol if applicable
  - properties: Specific physical properties with exact numerical values and units
  - composition: Detailed breakdown with exact percentages and chemical formulas
  - compatibility: At least 3 specific material/application combinations
  - applications: Detailed real-world use cases with specific parameters
  - environmentalImpact: Quantifiable environmental benefits
  - technicalSpecifications: Detailed laser parameters (provide specific values if known)
  - regulatoryStandards: Specific standards with organization names and descriptions
  - outcomes: Measurable results with specific metrics and measurement methods

  MATERIAL INFORMATION:
  - Chemical formula if applicable: {material_formula}
  - Symbol if applicable: {material_symbol}
  - Material type if applicable: {material_type}

  IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - Focus on technical accuracy and specific values rather than generic descriptions
  - Provide exact numerical data wherever possible (density, temperature, power, etc.)
  - Include specific industry standards (ISO, ASTM, EN, IEC numbers)
  - Use proper chemical formulas and technical terminology
  - Don't worry about formatting consistency - this will be standardized automatically
  - Don't specify image URLs or alt text - these will be generated automatically
  - Provide content in whatever YAML structure feels natural - it will be normalized
