  - name: The subject name only (string)
  - title: SEO-optimized page title (include "Laser Cleaning" and "Technical Guide")
  - headline: Concise description of content purpose (one line)
  - description: Technical overview highlighting key properties (string, 150-250 chars)
  - website: Authoritative URL for technical information (string with https://)
  - author: Comprehensive author information (object with name, country, credentials)
    IMPORTANT: Use the author with ID: {author_id} ({author_name} from {author_country})
  - keywords: Comprehensive search terms (array of 8-12 strings, including technical terms)
  - category: Material category (string: ceramic, metal, plastic, etc.)
  - chemicalProperties: Chemical data (object with formula, symbol, materialType)
  - properties: Physical properties (comprehensive object with density, meltingPoint, hardness, thermalConductivity, laserType, wavelength, fluenceRange)
  - composition: Detailed components (array of component objects with percentages, type, formula)
  - compatibility: Compatible materials and applications (array of material objects)
  - images: Image information (object with hero and closeup sections with descriptive alt text)
  - applications: Detailed use cases (array of objects with name and description)
  - environmentalImpact: Environmental benefits (array of objects with benefit and description)
  - technicalSpecifications: Detailed laser parameters (object with powerRange, pulseDuration, wavelength, spotSize, repetitionRate, fluenceRange, safetyClass)
  - regulatoryStandards: Applicable standards (array of standard objects with code and descriptions)
  - outcomes: Measurable results (array of objects with result and metric)

  CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Include precise numerical values for all physical properties (with units)
  - Provide detailed composition with exact percentages and chemical formulas
  - List at least 3 specific compatibility scenarios with detailed applications
  - Include standard units of measurement (g/cm³, °C, W/m·K, etc.)
  - Specify at least 2-3 regulatory or industry standards with organization and descriptions
  - Use proper technical terminology for material science and laser processing
  - Include environmental impact metrics with quantifiable benefits (percentages, comparisons)
  - Provide detailed technical specifications for laser parameters (power, duration, spot size)
  - Include measurable outcomes with appropriate measurement techniques
  - Add specific applications with detailed descriptions of the processes

  SCHEMA STRUCTURE:
  - Follow this schema structure exactly for {article_type}
  - Include ALL required fields with complete information
  - Ensure correct nesting and data types
  - Do not wrap content in a top-level "{article_type}Profile" key
  - Use the exact field names from the schema

  {schema}

  MATERIAL INFORMATION:
  - Chemical formula if applicable: {material_formula}
  - Symbol if applicable: {material_symbol}
  - Material type if applicable: {material_type}

  FORMAT:
  - Return raw YAML content only (no markdown code blocks)
  - Include all fields at the top level (do not wrap in 'materialProfile')
  - Be technically comprehensive and precise
  - Use specific, quantitative data rather than generic descriptions
  - Use multiline string format for descriptions containing colons or special characters
  - Include proper Unicode characters for units (°, ³, ·, etc.)
  - Use ranges (e.g., "100-500W") instead of single values when appropriate
  - Format complex fields consistently (arrays, nested objects)
  - Ensure SEO optimization for title, headline, and description fields
