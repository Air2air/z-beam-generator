version: "4.0.0"

template: |
  Generate frontmatter for {subject} laser cleaning.

  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Output ONLY the YAML frontmatter between --- markers
  - Do NOT include any additional content, explanations, or article text
  - Stop immediately after the closing --- marker
  - Do NOT add properties sections, laser parameters, or any other content
  
  FORMATTING REFERENCE:
  - MANDATORY: Follow the EXACT formatting shown in validators/examples/frontmatter.md
  - Pay special attention to the images section structure - it must be properly nested YAML
  - DO NOT use empty objects like "hero: {}" - always include nested alt and url properties
  - Ensure all YAML is valid and properly indented (2 spaces per level)

  Output EXACTLY this YAML structure:
