description: "Generates technical image captions for laser cleaning before/after comparisons"
version: "2.2"

template: |
  Create a technical image caption for a before/after laser cleaning comparison of {material}.
  
  STRICT WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Results section: MAXIMUM {results_word_count_max} WORDS (will be rejected if longer)
  - Equipment section: MAXIMUM {equipment_word_count_max} WORDS (will be rejected if longer)
  - NO EXCEPTIONS to these limits
  
  STRUCTURE:
  - Caption for image showing: degraded {shape} made of {material} â†’ laser-cleaned {shape}
  - Use technical data from frontmatter
  - Two sections: "Results" and "Equipment"
  - Focus on measurable changes
  
  FRONTMATTER:
  {all_frontmatter}
  
  SECTIONS:
  
  ### Results Section (STRICT MAXIMUM {results_word_count_max} WORDS)
  Begin with "**Results:**" and describe:
  1. Typical contaminants specific to {material}
  2. Cleanliness metrics and oxide layer reduction
  3. Surface property changes (roughness, wettability)
  4. Material integrity preservation
  
  ### Equipment Section (STRICT MAXIMUM {equipment_word_count_max} WORDS)
  Begin with "**Equipment:**" and describe:
  1. Power settings (energy density, power, pulse duration)
  2. Machine details (specific laser systems if available)
  
  USE TECHNICAL DATA:
  - Technical specifications (power, wavelength, pulse duration, spot size)
  - Application-specific surface treatments
  - Measurable results
  - Equipment details
