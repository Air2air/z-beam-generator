  Generate a technical image caption for {subject} laser cleaning.

  Create ONE two-line before/after caption following this general structure:

  - Vary the contamination descriptions (organic deposits, oxide layers, particulate buildup, staining, corrosion, scale, residues, etc.)
  - Vary the laser parameter presentations and result descriptions
  - Include specific technical values for wavelength, power, pulse duration, and spot size
  - Use varied language and phrasing to avoid repetitive patterns
  - Make descriptions specific to {subject} material properties and typical cleaning challenges
  - Use technical terminology and varied sentence structures for authenticity
