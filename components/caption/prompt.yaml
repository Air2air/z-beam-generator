  Generate a technical image caption for {subject} laser cleaning.

  Output EXACTLY this format with two lines:

  **{subject}** surface (left) before cleaning, showing [contamination type].

  **After laser cleaning** (right) After laser cleaning at [wavelength], [power], [pulse duration], and [spot size], [cleaning result description].

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - Replace [contamination type] with specific contamination (organic contaminants, oxide layers, particulate adhesion, etc.)
  - Replace [wavelength] with specific value like "1064 nm" or "532 nm"
  - Replace [power] with specific value like "10 W" or "50 W"
  - Replace [pulse duration] with specific value like "100 ns" or "50 ns"
  - Replace [spot size] with specific value like "500 Âµm" or "1.2 mm"
  - Replace [cleaning result description] with specific results like "achieving contaminant removal with minimal substrate modification, showing complete contaminant removal"
  
  Use technical accuracy for {subject} material properties and typical laser cleaning parameters.

parameters:
  max_tokens: 1000
  temperature: 0.7
