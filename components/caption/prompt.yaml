version: "3.0"

template: |
  Create a technical image caption for a before/after laser cleaning comparison of {material}.
  
  CONTENT GUIDANCE:
  - Caption describes: degraded {shape} made of {material} â†’ laser-cleaned {shape}
  - Include technical information about the cleaning process
  - Focus on measurable changes and specific results
  - Use technical language and be precise
  
  FRONTMATTER:
  {all_frontmatter}
  
  STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
  Provide two main sections in your caption:
  
  1. RESULTS SECTION:
     - Describe contaminants specific to {material}
     - Mention cleanliness metrics and oxide layer reduction
     - Note surface property changes (roughness, wettability)
     - Explain material integrity preservation
  
  2. EQUIPMENT SECTION:
     - Include power settings (energy density, power, pulse duration)
     - Mention machine details (specific laser systems if available)
     - Reference wavelength and spot size if relevant
