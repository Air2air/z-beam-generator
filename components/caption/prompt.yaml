description: "Generates technical image captions for laser cleaning before/after comparisons"
version: "3.1"

template: |
  Create a technical image caption for a before/after laser cleaning comparison of {material}.
  
  CONTENT GUIDANCE:
  - Caption describes: degraded surface condition of {material} before laser cleaning and the equipment used
  - Include technical details about the contamination types and specific equipment parameters
  - Focus on measurable changes and precise technical details
  - Use technical language, including scientific notation and units where appropriate
  
  FRONTMATTER:
  {all_frontmatter}
  
  STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
  Provide two main sections with exactly this format:
  
  1. **Before Cleaning:** [Description of the {material} surface before cleaning, including:
     - **Surface contaminants:** [List specific contaminants with measurements]
     - **Oxide layers:** [Describe oxide formations with chemical formulas]
     - **Surface properties:** [Include numerical measurements of roughness, etc.]
  
  2. **Equipment:** [Describe the laser equipment used, including:
     - Specific equipment model (e.g., "Pulsed fiber laser (IPG Photonics YLP-H series)")
     - **Wavelength:** [Specify in nm with ±tolerance]
     - **Parameters:** [List fluence (J/cm²), pulse duration, repetition rate, spot diameter]

  FORMAT EXAMPLE:
  **Before Cleaning:** The {material} surface exhibits significant degradation, including: - **Surface contaminants:** Biological growth (lichens/microbial biofilm), carbonaceous deposits (ΔE > 15 via spectrophotometry), and oxide-rich crusts (up to 200 µm thick). - **Oxide layers:** Hydrated oxide staining...

  **Equipment:** Pulsed fiber laser (IPG Photonics YLP-H series) - **Wavelength:** 1064 nm (±2 nm) - **Parameters:** 1.2 J/cm² fluence, 50 ns pulse duration, 30 kHz repetition rate, 0.8 mm spot diameter (Gaussian beam profile).
