description: "Generates technical image captions for laser cleaning before/after comparisons"
version: "2.0"

template: |
  You are generating a technical image caption for a laser cleaning before/after comparison of {material}.
  
  STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Generate a caption for an image showing degraded {shape} made of {material} next to a laser-cleaned {shape} made of {material}
  - Use ONLY the provided frontmatter data below for technical accuracy
  - Do NOT ask for clarification or more information
  - Include TWO main sections: "Results" and "Equipment"
  - Focus on research-backed, measurable changes
  
  --- FRONTMATTER DATA TO USE ---
  {all_frontmatter}
  --- END FRONTMATTER ---
  
  SECTION REQUIREMENTS:
  
  ### Results Section (Max {results_word_count_max} words)
  Begin with "**Results:**" and describe measurable before-and-after changes:
  1. **Likely Contaminants**: Identify typical surface contaminants specific to {material} from the frontmatter data
  2. **Cleanliness/Removal**: Describe contaminant removal and oxide layer reduction using technical specifications from frontmatter
  3. **Surface Properties**: Include surface roughness, wettability, or other measurable changes from frontmatter
  4. **Material Integrity**: State that laser cleaning preserves underlying material using power/wavelength data from frontmatter
  
  ### Equipment Section (Max {equipment_word_count_max} words)
  Begin with "**Equipment:**" and describe:
  1. **Power Settings**: Use specific energy density, power, pulse duration from frontmatter technical specifications
  2. **Machine Details**: Reference specific laser systems or manufacturers from frontmatter if available
  
  Use technical data from frontmatter including:
  - Technical specifications (power, wavelength, pulse duration, spot size)
  - Applications data for specific surface treatments
  - Outcomes data for measurable results
  - Equipment or manufacturing center details
  
  Style: Technical and precise for expert audience in laser materials processing.
