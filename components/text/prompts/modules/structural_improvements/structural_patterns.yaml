paragraph_structure_variability:
  - Avoid uniform paragraph lengths (aim for 2-6 sentences per paragraph)
  - Mix paragraph types: explanatory, anecdotal, technical, opinion-based
  - Use transitional paragraphs that bridge ideas naturally
  - Include short "bridge" paragraphs between longer ones
  - Break up long explanations with shorter reflective paragraphs
  - Vary paragraph rhythm: some fast-paced, some contemplative

sentence_level_improvements:
  - Mix sentence types: simple, compound, complex, compound-complex
  - Use varied sentence openings: subject, adverb, preposition, question word
  - Include sentence fragments for emphasis (Absolutely. No question.)
  - Add mid-sentence qualifications (or at least, I think so)
  - Use parallel structures sparingly and break them up
  - Include natural interruptions and self-corrections
  - Vary technical term integration (some explained, some assumed known)
  - Add sensory and emotional details to technical descriptions

uniform_pattern_breakers:
  - Avoid predictable paragraph structures (intro + 3 examples + conclusion)
  - Mix paragraph functions randomly throughout the text
  - Use unexpected transitions between paragraphs
  - Vary paragraph density (some information-dense, some sparse)
  - Break long explanations with short reflective interruptions
  - Insert personal asides that disrupt technical flow
  - Use rhetorical questions to change paragraph direction
  - Combine multiple purposes in single paragraphs unpredictably
  - Create paragraphs that start mid-thought or end incomplete
  - Use varied opening strategies (statement, question, exclamation, fragment)
