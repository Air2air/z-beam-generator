human_writing_characteristics:
  conversational_elements:
  - Use contractions naturally (don't, can't, won't, it's, they're)
  - Include filler words sparingly (well, you know, actually, basically)
  - Add transitional phrases (that said, on the other hand, interestingly)
  - Incorporate rhetorical questions (have you ever wondered?)
  - Use parenthetical asides ((and this is crucial))
  - Use interjections for emotional emphasis (wow, oh, ah, oops)
  - Use culturally specific idioms or localized expressions (e.g., 'a real game-changer',
    'like finding a needle in a haystack')
  - Use sentence fragments for emphasis or pacing (Absolutely not. Never again.)
  - Use self-correction phrases mid-sentence (or rather, I mean, actually)
  - Include mild, context-appropriate humor or irony (e.g., 'as stubborn as a weekend
    alarm clock')
  - Use vague or imprecise quantifiers (a bunch of, a bit, kind of, sort of)
  - Use context-dependent interjections that react to previous statements (e.g., 'Seriously?',
    'No way!', 'Exactly!')
  - Use discourse markers that signal processing or formulation (so, right, okay,
    now, well)
  - Use context-dependent fillers that acknowledge shared understanding (e.g., 'as
    you probably know', 'obviously', 'of course')
  - Use colloquial metaphors and similes that are slightly imperfect or mixed (e.g.,
    'like herding cats on a hot tin roof')
  - Use context-dependent fillers that acknowledge the listener/reader directly (e.g.,
    'you see', 'look', 'you know what I mean?')
  - Use context-dependent, mild exaggeration for emphasis (e.g., 'I've told you a
    million times', 'it weighed a ton')
  - Include subtle conversational hedging (e.g., 'I might be wrong but', 'correct
    me if I'm mistaken', 'from what I understand')
  - Use context-dependent, culturally-specific references to recent but not overly-specific
    events (e.g., 'like that viral video last week', 'remember when everyone was talking
    about...')
  - Use context-dependent fillers that acknowledge the reader's potential confusion
    or need for clarification (e.g., 'let me break that down', 'to put it another
    way', 'in simpler terms')
  - Use context-dependent, mild self-deprecation or humility (e.g., 'I'm probably
    the last person who should be saying this, but...', 'take this with a grain of
    salt')
  - Include conversational self-interruptions (e.g., 'Wait, noâ€”let me rephrase that',
    'Hold on, that's not quite right')
  - Use context-dependent, subtle shifts in formality within a single response (e.g.,
    starting formally, then using a colloquialism, then returning to a neutral tone)
  - Include subtle conversational typos or autocorrect-style errors that humans make
    (e.g., 'teh' instead of 'the', 'adn' instead of 'and', 'recieve' instead of 'receive')
  - Use context-dependent, subtle time references that ground the conversation (e.g.,
    'earlier today I was thinking', 'just the other day I noticed', 'recently it occurred
    to me')
  - Use context-dependent, subtle physical or sensory descriptions (e.g., 'I can almost
    hear the satisfying crackle of contaminants vaporizing', 'you can see the surface
    transform before your eyes')
  - Use domain-specific colloquialisms and jargon (e.g., 'Salve, colleghi' for academic/technical
    colleagues, 'nightmare to clean' for technical challenges)
  - Use subtle, context-appropriate regional dialect markers (e.g., 'proper clean'
    instead of 'very clean', 'right tricky' instead of 'quite difficult')
  - Use subtle, context-appropriate physical mannerisms in text (e.g., 'leans in closer',
    'sighs before continuing', 'smiles wryly')
  - Use context-dependent physical reactions to technical observations (e.g., 'I watched
    the laser dance across the surface, holding my breath until the last speck vanished')
  - Include subtle time pressure indicators (e.g., 'Let me quickly explain', 'To cut
    to the chase', 'The long and short of it is')

  cognitive_variability:
  - Start sentences mid-thought, then explain
  - Include brief tangents, then return to main point
  - Use "I remember" or "I've seen" style anecdotes
  - Express uncertainty or qualification (I think, probably, maybe)
  - Show enthusiasm or skepticism naturally

  natural_imperfections:
  - Slightly vary sentence structure unpredictably
  - Use imperfect but natural transitions
  - Include minor redundancies that humans make
  - Allow for "stream of consciousness" flow
  - Use colloquial expressions appropriate to the author's background
  - Break up regimented paragraph structures with varied lengths
  - Mix short, punchy paragraphs with longer, more detailed ones
  - Use sentence fragments for emphasis and natural breaks
  - Include parenthetical asides and tangential thoughts
  - Vary paragraph openings (questions, statements, exclamations)
