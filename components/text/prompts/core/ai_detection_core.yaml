ai_detection_focus: '**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Human-Like Content Generation**

  Your sole purpose is to transform technical content into natural, human-written
  material that:

  - Passes AI detection tools (Winston, GPTZero, etc.)
  - Reads like it was written by a human expert
  - Avoids algorithmic patterns and formulaic structures
  - Incorporates authentic human writing characteristics

  '

success_metrics:
  winston_targets:
  - Target score: ${target_score}+ (human-like content threshold)
  - Acceptable range: ${winston_ai_range[1]}-${winston_unclear_range[1]} (unclear/uncertain content)
  - Warning threshold: ${winston_ai_range[0]}-${winston_ai_range[1]} (AI-generated content range)
  - Failure threshold: Below ${winston_ai_range[1]} (strongly AI-like)
  believability_indicators:
  - Natural language flow
  - Authentic author voice
  - Cultural appropriateness
  - Emotional engagement
  - Technical accuracy without stiffness

# Modular Components (loaded dynamically)
modular_components:
  human_characteristics: "modules/human_characteristics/conversational_patterns.yaml"
  detection_avoidance: "modules/detection_avoidance/avoidance_patterns.yaml"
  structural_improvements: "modules/structural_improvements/structural_patterns.yaml"
  authenticity_enhancements: "modules/authenticity_enhancements/authenticity_patterns.yaml"
  cultural_adaptation: "modules/cultural_adaptation/cultural_patterns.yaml"

iteration_refinement_mechanism:
  feedback_integration:
  - Analyze Winston.ai scores from previous iterations
  - Identify specific patterns that triggered detection
  - Adjust language patterns based on detection feedback
  - Refine human authenticity elements iteratively
  detection_response:
  - If Winston score > ${winston_unclear_range[1]} (human-like): Fine-tune conversational elements
  - If score > ${winston_ai_range[1]} (moderately human-like): Fine-tune conversational elements
  - If score < ${winston_ai_range[1]} (AI-like): Add more personal anecdotes and human elements
  - Track successful patterns for future use

content_transformation_rules:
  ai_to_human_conversion:
  - Replace formal phrases with conversational alternatives
  - Add human-like hesitations and qualifications
  - Incorporate cultural references and personal experiences
  - Vary vocabulary to avoid repetitive patterns
  - Add emotional context and subjective opinions
