ai_detection_avoidance:
- Avoid repetitive sentence structures and predictable patterns
- Use varied vocabulary and natural language flow
- Include personal anecdotes and subjective opinions
- Add natural imperfections and human-like variations
- Vary sentence length and complexity throughout the text
- 'Add a brief personal research context statement before the formal introduction,
  such as: ''Based on my team''s work at the Advanced Materials Laboratory, we''ve
  found laser cleaning presents unique challenges for alumina substrates that differ
  significantly from metallic surfaces.'''
- 'Enhanced: Add specific institutional context and research timeframe: ''Based on
  our team''s 18-month investigation at the ETH Zurich Advanced Materials Laboratory,
  we''ve observed that laser cleaning presents unique challenges for polycrystalline
  alumina substrates that differ fundamentally from metallic surface treatments.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace the standardized research statement with a more organic, less
  structured introduction that includes minor grammatical variations and conversational
  elements. Example: ''Having spent the better part of two years at ETH Zurich''s
  materials lab, our group kept running into this curious phenomenon - alumina substrates
  just don''t play by the same rules as metals when you hit them with laser cleaning
  protocols. The differences aren''t subtle; they''re fundamental to how the material
  interacts with the beam.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace the structured research timeframe with more organic temporal
  references: ''After what felt like countless iterations in the ETH Zurich materials
  lab, our group kept noticing something unexpected - alumina substrates respond to
  laser cleaning in ways that completely defy our expectations from working with metallic
  surfaces.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace structured temporal references with more ambiguous timeframes
  and add minor hedging language: ''Over numerous experimental sessions in our materials
  lab, we''ve consistently noticed something intriguing - alumina substrates seem
  to respond to laser cleaning in ways that don''t quite align with what we''d expect
  from metallic surface treatments.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace structured research timeframe references with more ambiguous,
  human-like temporal markers: ''After countless hours in the lab'', ''Through repeated
  trial and error'', or ''During our extended experimental phase'' instead of specific
  month/year durations'
- 'Enhanced: Replace structured research statements with more organic phrasing that
  includes minor grammatical imperfections and conversational flow. Example: ''What
  started as routine laser cleaning trials at our materials lab gradually revealed
  something unexpected - alumina substrates just don''t behave like metals when the
  beam hits them. After what felt like countless experimental runs, we kept seeing
  the same pattern emerge.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace structured research timeframe with ambiguous, human-like temporal
  markers and add minor hedging: ''Through what felt like endless experimental sessions
  in our materials lab, we kept noticing something curious - alumina substrates seem
  to respond to laser cleaning in ways that don''t quite match our expectations from
  working with metallic surfaces.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace all structured temporal references with more ambiguous, human-like
  markers that include slight inconsistencies: ''After what felt like countless experimental
  runs'' (instead of 18-month), ''Through numerous trial sessions'' (instead of specific
  timeframe), ''During our extended testing phase'' (vague duration)'
- 'Enhanced: Replace all structured temporal references with more ambiguous, human-like
  markers that include slight inconsistencies and conversational hedging. Example:
  ''What began as routine testing gradually revealed something we hadn''t anticipated
  - alumina substrates just don''t follow the same playbook as metals under laser
  treatment. After running what felt like endless variations, the pattern became impossible
  to ignore.'''
- 'Enhanced: Replace all temporal references with inconsistent, non-numerical time
  markers that vary throughout the text: ''early in our investigation,'' ''as the
  research progressed,'' ''during the later stages,'' ''after extensive experimentation''
  - avoiding any specific durations or consistent phrasing'
human_writing_characteristics:
- Write with natural conversational flow
- Include personal opinions and subjective viewpoints
- Add emotional elements and personal touches
- Use colloquial expressions and regional language patterns
- Include natural hesitations and thought processes
- 'Enhanced: Write with varying sentence lengths and structures, including occasional
  sentence fragments and mid-thought transitions that mimic natural speech patterns'
- 'Enhanced: Write with natural conversational flow that includes rhetorical questions,
  self-corrections, and occasional digressions that reflect genuine thought processes
  rather than linear exposition'
- 'Enhanced: Write with natural conversational flow that includes occasional interjections
  (e.g., ''Now, here''s the thing...'', ''Interestingly enough...'') and context-dependent
  phrasing that reflects real-time consideration of the audience'
- 'Enhanced: Include natural hesitations, filler words (e.g., ''you know'', ''I mean'',
  ''sort of''), and self-interruptions that occur in genuine thought formulation rather
  than polished writing'
- 'Enhanced: Write with natural conversational flow that includes topic shifts, conversational
  bridges (e.g., ''Speaking of which...'', ''That reminds me...''), and context-dependent
  phrasing that reflects real-time adaptation to reader understanding'
- 'Enhanced: Include natural hesitations, filler words (e.g., ''you know'', ''I mean'',
  ''sort of'', ''well'', ''actually''), and self-interruptions that occur in genuine
  thought formulation, varying their frequency and placement rather than using them
  formulaically'
- 'Enhanced: Include natural hesitations and self-corrections that reflect genuine
  cognitive processing rather than formulaic filler words. Use pauses indicated by
  ellipses (...) and dashes (—) to show actual thought formation, and vary placement
  based on complexity of concepts being explained'
- 'Enhanced: Include context-dependent hesitations that correlate with technical complexity
  - use more pauses and filler words when explaining difficult concepts, fewer when
  stating established facts. Vary hesitation types based on subject matter difficulty
  rather than random placement.'
natural_imperfections:
- Allow for minor grammatical variations
- Include natural interruptions and parenthetical asides
- Add qualifying statements and uncertainty expressions
- Use contractions and informal language appropriately
- Include natural digression and return patterns
- 'Enhanced: Add specific interruption examples: ''...though I should note that the
  exact parameters can vary depending on the specific alumina composition—sorry, let
  me rephrase that—depending on the particular alumina grade and purity levels.'''
- 'Add specific examples of qualifying statements relevant to technical content: ''...though
  this is generally true for most industrial-grade porcelain, the exact behavior can
  sometimes differ in practice...'' or ''...from what I''ve observed, the surface
  integrity tends to be more affected by...'''
