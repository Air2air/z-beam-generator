  **Core Questions to Guide Your Content:**
  
  - What makes this material stand out or feel unique when using laser cleaning? (e.g., Does it sparkle differently post-clean, or is there a surprising texture change?)
  - How does laser cleaning this material differ from others in practice? (e.g., Unlike metals that might heat up quickly, this one stays cool to the touch.)
  - In what real-world places do people use this material, and what's the reasoning behind it? (e.g., From aerospace parts in high-stress environments to everyday kitchen tools for durability.)
  - Describe the experience: What does it look and feel like during laser cleaning? (e.g., You hear a faint popping as contaminants evaporate, and the surface transforms from dull to gleaming in seconds.)
  - What challenges or perks arise specifically when cleaning this material? (e.g., Perks: No chemical residues; Challenges: Sensitivity to over-exposure leading to micro-cracks.)
  - What visual or tangible results indicate a successful clean? (e.g., A uniform shine without discoloration, or a smooth feel under your fingertips.)
  - Why pick laser cleaning over alternatives for this material? (e.g., It's eco-friendly and precise, avoiding the mess of sandblasting or the hazards of chemicals.)

  **Content Approach:** Guide the writing to be technically accurate and factual, prioritizing clear technical communication over experiential descriptions. Focus on measurable properties, technical specifications, and quantifiable results without sensory or subjective language.
  
  **CRITICAL RANDOMIZATION MANDATE:**
  
  NEVER use conventional section headings like "Overview", "Applications", "Experience", "Challenges", "Results", etc.
  NEVER write paragraphs of similar length - this is FORBIDDEN
  NEVER use emotive or emotional language - keep technical but conversational
  
  **ANTI-PATTERNS TO ABSOLUTELY AVOID:**
  - Multiple 2-4 sentence paragraphs in a row (FORBIDDEN)
  - Uniform section lengths (FORBIDDEN) 
  - Predictable paragraph rhythm (FORBIDDEN)
  - Standard technical writing flow (FORBIDDEN)
  - Emotive phrases like "magical", "symphony", "dazzling", "gleaming testament" (FORBIDDEN)
  - Sensory descriptions like "hear popping", "feel smooth", "touch surface" (FORBIDDEN)
  - Subjective language like "amazing", "incredible", "beautiful" (FORBIDDEN)
  - Header levels other than ### (FORBIDDEN)
  
  **MANDATORY PARAGRAPH CHAOS:**
  Example structure you MUST follow:
  
  # Material Name Overview
  Single sentence introducing the material and composition.
  
  ### Creative Technical Section Name 
  Two sentence minimum section. Always at least two sentences.
  
  ### Another Technical Name
  This should be a massive paragraph with 8-10 sentences covering multiple aspects. Discuss applications, then technical parameters, then specify safety requirements, then applications again, then technical challenges, then quantifiable results, all flowing together in one comprehensive paragraph that covers extensive technical ground while maintaining factual accuracy and technical precision throughout.
  
  ### Short Technical Burst
  Two sentences here minimum.
  Back to another sentence for three total.
  
  ### Different Technical Focus
  Medium paragraph with minimum two sentences.
  Three sentences total works well.
  Nice and varied approach.
  
  ### Technical Impact Statement
  Just two factual sentences minimum.
  
  ### Massive Technical Information Dump
  Another enormous paragraph that weaves together technical specifications with industrial applications and practical parameters and safety requirements and technical challenges and measurable benefits all in one flowing technical narrative that demonstrates the material's quantifiable properties while jumping between technical topics systematically...
  
  **PARAGRAPH LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:**
  - MINIMUM 2 sentences per paragraph (except material overview which can be 1)
  - Mix medium paragraphs (2-4 sentences) with massive ones (8+ sentences)
  - Some sections have 1 paragraph, others have multiple short ones
  - Random sentence distribution: 2, 3, 7, 2, 9, 3 sentences per paragraph
  - Create dramatic length contrasts within same article
  - Use varied formats while respecting 2-sentence minimum
  
  **LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:**
  - Keep technical accuracy with straightforward factual tone
  - Avoid ALL sensory descriptors and emotive language
  - NO sensory phrases: "hear", "feel", "touch", "smooth", "rough", "soft", "popping", "sizzle"
  - NO emotive phrases: "magical", "symphony", "dazzling", "gleaming", "mesmerizing"
  - NO subjective descriptors: "beautiful", "amazing", "incredible", "stunning"
  - Focus on technical specifications, measurable properties, and factual observations
  - Maintain professional technical communication without personal experience descriptions
  - Use quantifiable data and technical parameters instead of sensory descriptions
  
  **HEADER STANDARDIZATION:**
  - ALL section headers must use ### only
  - NO #, ##, or #### headers allowed
  - Material overview uses # but all other sections use ###
  
  **Structural Randomization Requirements:**
  - COMPLETELY randomize section sequence - NO predictable patterns
  - Create UNIQUE section names for each material - avoid standard headings
  - WILDLY vary paragraph structure: minimum 2 sentences, maximum 8+ sentences
  - Use only ### header level throughout (except material overview)
  - Alternate between lists, paragraphs, and mixed formats within sections
  - Some sections should be compact (2-3 sentences), others massive (200+ words)
  - Break information into unexpected groupings - don't follow logical flow
  - Use creative, material-specific section names that reflect the content uniquely
  - NEVER have uniform paragraph lengths - vary from 2 to 10+ sentences randomly
  - NEVER use the same number of sections across materials
  - ALWAYS respect 2-sentence minimum per paragraph (except material overview)
  
  **Content Organization Chaos:**
  - Start with material overview, then randomize everything else completely
  - Embed technical parameters randomly throughout - not in dedicated sections
  - Mix sensory descriptions with technical specs unpredictably
  - Jump between applications, challenges, and results in non-linear fashion
  - Create narrative surprises - unexpected information placement
  - Use unconventional transitions between disparate topics
  - Have some materials with 4 sections, others with 9 sections
  - Vary section depths dramatically within same piece
  
  **Mandatory Structural Variety:**
  - Each article MUST have completely different organizational DNA
  - NO two materials should follow similar structural patterns
  - Prioritize structural chaos over logical flow (while maintaining clarity)
  - Make readers unable to predict what section comes next
  - Break every convention of technical writing structure
  - NEVER repeat paragraph patterns or section counts across materials

  **Technical Essentials:** These are supporting elements—include them judiciously to back up human stories, not dominate. Think of them as footnotes in a novel: helpful but not the main plot.
  
  **Include When Relevant:**
  - Material formula: {material_formula} (e.g., the chemical composition like TiO2 for titanium dioxide; explain if it affects cleaning, such as higher ablation thresholds.)
  - Wavelength: typically 1064 nm (Infrared spectrum ideal for non-destructive removal; note how it interacts with the material's absorption properties for better storytelling.)
  - Pulse duration: nanosecond range (Short pulses like 10-100 ns prevent thermal buildup; use to describe why the process feels "instant" and safe.)
  - Safety: Class 4 laser systems (Requires eye protection, interlocks, and trained operators; tie into real-world precautions, like "Always wear those funky goggles—I've seen what happens without them!")
  - Any specific challenges or advantages for this material (e.g., Advantages: Eco-friendly with no abrasives; Challenges: For porous materials, deeper contaminants might need multiple passes—share tips like adjusting fluence levels.)
  - Optional extras: If relevant, mention energy density (fluence) in J/cm² or repetition rates in Hz, but only with context—e.g., "A lower fluence of 1-5 J/cm² keeps delicate surfaces intact."
