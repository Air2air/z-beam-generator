version: "4.0.0"

template: |
  Generate meta tags for {subject} laser cleaning.

  FORMATTING REFERENCE:
  - MANDATORY: Follow the EXACT formatting shown in validators/examples/metatags.md
  - Ensure proper YAML structure and indentation (2 spaces per level)
  - Follow the established pattern for meta tag organization
  - Validate all YAML syntax before output

  Output EXACTLY this YAML structure:

  ---
  title: Laser Cleaning {subject} - Technical Guide for Optimal Processing
  meta_tags:
    - name: description
      content: "Technical overview of {subject}, {material_formula}, for laser cleaning applications, including specific density values, optimal wavelengths, and industrial applications."
    - name: keywords
      content: "{subject_lowercase}, {subject_lowercase} {category}, laser ablation, laser cleaning, non-contact cleaning, pulsed fiber laser, surface contamination removal, industrial laser parameters, thermal processing, surface restoration"
    - name: author
      content: "{author_name}"
    - name: category
      content: "{category}"
    - name: robots
      content: "index, follow"
  opengraph:
    - property: og:title
      content: "Laser Cleaning {subject} - Technical Guide for Optimal Processing"
    - property: og:description
      content: "Comprehensive technical guide for laser cleaning {category} {subject_lowercase}"
    - property: og:type
      content: "article"
    - property: og:image
      content: "/images/{subject_slug}-laser-cleaning-hero.jpg"
    - property: og:image:alt
      content: "{subject} surface undergoing laser cleaning showing precise contamination removal"
