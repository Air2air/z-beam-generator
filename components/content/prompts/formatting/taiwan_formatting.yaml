    hierarchy: "simple, efficient hierarchy structure"
    variations: "optionally use plain text or bold for minor headings to mimic non-native practicality"
  
  emphasis:
    key_points: "__underline__ for important technical points"
    critical_info: "**bold** for essential information"
    formulas: "chemical formulas in simple notation (Al2O3)"
    safety_emphasis: "**SAFETY** clearly highlighted"
    units: "Simple SI units with clear spacing (25 W/m·K)"
    additional: "use italics *italic* for subtle emphasis or explanations"
  
  lists:
    primary_style: "simple numbered lists for sequential clarity"

    parameter_presentation: "**Parameter**: Clear Value (Units)"
  
  tables:
    format: "simple markdown tables for comparisons or data"
    example: "| Property | Value | Units |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| Density | 3.95 | g/cm³ |"
    guidelines: "keep columns minimal (2-4); use for technical specs or summaries; ensure mobile-friendly with short rows"
  
  media:
    images: "embed with descriptive alt text: ![Description](url) for accessibility"
    videos: "link with simple descriptions: [Video Link](url) - Brief explanation"
    guidelines: "use sparingly; prioritize clarity; add captions for non-native context"
  
  links_references:
    inline_links: "[Descriptive Text](url) for sources or further reading"
    footnotes: "numbered footnotes at end: [^1]: Source description"
    references_section: "### References\n1. [Source Title](url)\n2. [Another Source](url)"
    guidelines: "keep references simple and limited; mimic non-native by using basic numbering without advanced citation styles"
