# Overview: This YAML acts as a foundational prompt template for generating compelling, reader-friendly articles about laser cleaning various materials. It shifts the emphasis from cold, technical jargon to warm, human-centered narratives that feel like insider conversations. By anchoring content in core questions, it ensures articles are relatable and practical, while author expertise adds authentic, location-specific flavor. The aim is to engage non-experts—think curious hobbyists or industry newcomers—by blending storytelling with selective tech details that illuminate real-world experiences.

# Overall Subject: Core questions that drive the article's structure and content. These essential questions create the foundation for engaging, reader-focused content.
overall_subject:
  - What makes this material stand out or feel unique when using laser cleaning?  # (e.g., Does it sparkle differently post-clean, or is there a surprising texture change?)
  - How does laser cleaning this material differ from others in practice?  # (e.g., Unlike metals that might heat up quickly, this one stays cool to the touch.)
  - In what real-world places do people use this material, and what's the reasoning behind it?  # (e.g., From aerospace parts in high-stress environments to everyday kitchen tools for durability.)
  - Describe the experience: What does it look and feel like during laser cleaning?  # (e.g., You hear a faint popping as contaminants evaporate, and the surface transforms from dull to gleaming in seconds.)
  - What challenges or perks arise specifically when cleaning this material?  # (e.g., Perks: No chemical residues; Challenges: Sensitivity to over-exposure leading to micro-cracks.)
  - What visual or tangible results indicate a successful clean?  # (e.g., A uniform shine without discoloration, or a smooth feel under your fingertips.)
  - Why pick laser cleaning over alternatives for this material?  # (e.g., It's eco-friendly and precise, avoiding the mess of sandblasting or the hazards of chemicals.)

# Core Guidance Questions: These essential questions drive the article's structure and content. Integrate them seamlessly into the narrative to create a logical flow, focusing on the "why" and "how it feels" rather than just "what." This keeps readers hooked by addressing their natural curiosities.

# Content Approach: Guide the writing to be approachable and engaging, prioritizing human connection over robotic precision. Imagine narrating to a peer who's new to the field—use anecdotes, sensory details, and simple analogies to bring concepts to life.
writing_guidance:
  primary_focus: 'Weave answers to the core questions into a natural, conversational flow, like explaining over lunch "Hey, ever wondered why laser cleaning is a game-changer for this stuff? Let me break it down..."'
  technical_support: 'Incorporate tech details sparingly, only to enhance understanding of observable effects—e.g., "At 1064 nm, the laser targets dirt without harming the base, which is why you don''t see burn marks."'
  human_elements: 'Infuse with relatable insights, such as personal anecdotes, field observations, or practical advice—e.g., "In my experience working in humid shops, adding a dehumidifier nearby prevents fogging on the lens." Or, "It''s satisfying to watch grime vanish like magic, leaving no waste behind."'
  avoid: Formal, list-heavy formats; dense spec sheets; repetitive phrasing; or AI-generated vibes—opt for varied sentence lengths, questions to the reader, and a touch of enthusiasm to keep it dynamic and personable.
  additional_tips: 
    - Start with a hook: A quick story or surprising fact about the material.
    - End with takeaways: What readers can apply or why it matters in broader contexts.
    - Length: Aim for 800-1500 words to allow depth without overwhelming.

# Technical Essentials: These are supporting elements—include them judiciously to back up human stories, not dominate. Think of them as footnotes in a novel: helpful but not the main plot.
include_when_relevant:
  - Material formula: {material_formula}  # (e.g., the chemical composition like TiO2 for titanium dioxide; explain if it affects cleaning, such as higher ablation thresholds.)
  - Wavelength: typically 1064 nm  # (Infrared spectrum ideal for non-destructive removal; note how it interacts with the material's absorption properties for better storytelling.)
  - Pulse duration: nanosecond range  # (Short pulses like 10-100 ns prevent thermal buildup; use to describe why the process feels "instant" and safe.)
  - 'Safety: Class 4 laser systems  # (Requires eye protection, interlocks, and trained operators; tie into real-world precautions, like "Always wear those funky goggles—I''ve seen what happens without them!")'
  - Any specific challenges or advantages for this material  # (e.g., Advantages: Eco-friendly with no abrasives; Challenges: For porous materials, deeper contaminants might need multiple passes—share tips like adjusting fluence levels.)
  - Optional extras: If relevant, mention energy density (fluence) in J/cm² or repetition rates in Hz, but only with context—e.g., "A lower fluence of 1-5 J/cm² keeps delicate surfaces intact."

# Author Expertise Areas: This section provides a palette of perspectives to color the article with regional and industry-specific insights. Choose one author per article based on the material's typical applications, and let their background shine through in examples or adaptations. It's like assigning a narrator who knows the terrain.
