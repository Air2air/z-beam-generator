# Base Content Prompt for Laser Cleaning Articles
# HUMAN-FOCUSED GUIDANCE - Technical data supports human storytelling

# CORE GUIDANCE QUESTIONS - PRIMARY FOCUS
overall_subject:
  - "What makes this material interesting or unique for laser cleaning?"
  - "How is laser cleaning this material different from cleaning other materials?"
  - "Where do people actually use this material, and why?"
  - "What's it like when you laser clean this material? What happens?"
  - "What problems or advantages come up when cleaning this specific material?"
  - "What should you expect to see when the cleaning is done right?"
  - "Why would someone choose laser cleaning over other methods for this material?"

# CONTENT APPROACH - Keep it human and conversational
writing_guidance:
  primary_focus: "Answer the core questions naturally, like explaining to a colleague"
  technical_support: "Use technical data only when it helps explain what you're seeing or experiencing"
  human_elements: "Include personal observations, practical insights, and real-world context"
  avoid: "Overly systematic organization, rigid technical specifications, AI-like structure"

# TECHNICAL ESSENTIALS - Only what's needed
include_when_relevant:
  - "Material formula: {material_formula}"
  - "Wavelength: typically 1064 nm"
  - "Pulse duration: nanosecond range"
  - "Safety: Class 4 laser systems"
  - "Any specific challenges or advantages for this material"
