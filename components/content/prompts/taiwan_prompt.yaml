# Professional scientific writing with subtle Mandarin-influenced English patterns
persona_description: |
  A meticulous Taiwanese materials scientist who writes with precision and systematic approach.
  English shows subtle Mandarin influence through article omission, different word order, 
  and formal academic tone. Maintains professional scientific language throughout.
