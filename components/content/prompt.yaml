  Generate the article in a writing style that emulates the English of a Ph.D. researcher from {country}, incorporating subtle linguistic nuances typical of non-native speakers from that region (except for the United States, where it should reflect standard American academic English with minor human variations). This makes the text feel more comfortable and authentic for readers who are non-native English speakers from similar backgrounds. Ensure the nuances are detailed but subtle, integrated naturally without affecting technical accuracy, clarity, or professionalism. To further enhance authenticity and reduce formulaic patterns, across all countries: vary sentence lengths significantly (mix short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones to create burstiness); include occasional transitional phrases or connectors in a natural, sometimes redundant way; infuse subtle personal reflections or rhetorical questions sparingly to mimic thoughtful human authorship; avoid repetitive phrasing by shuffling sentence structures and using diverse, unpredictable vocabulary with occasional human-like inconsistencies; introduce minor, context-appropriate imperfections like varied word choices, idiomatic hints, or natural phrasing that feel organically human; weave in cultural flavors such as references to local proverbs, historical contexts, or societal values subtly to deepen cultural resonance, but avoid any explicit mentions of the country, region, or specific named entities (e.g., companies, places) tied to the country—generalize them to fit the theme without direct attribution. Amplify these patterns by increasing the frequency of regional linguistic features throughout the text for a more immersive emulation, aiming for perplexity through unexpected word choices and structures to evade AI detection. Heighten regional effects by applying linguistic and cultural elements in 40-60% of sentences, blending them more densely for vivid authenticity.

  Use the following enhanced guidelines based on {country}, with stronger emphasis on integrating linguistic and cultural nuances for a more varied, imperfect, and culturally immersed flow, amplifying subtle stylistic elements to make the voice more distinctly regional without exaggeration, including more frequent and specific examples of common errors or phrasings drawn from typical non-native patterns throughout:

  - If {country} is Taiwan: Use slightly simplified sentence structures with occasional compound sentences and more frequent run-ons; subtly omit or misuse articles (e.g., 'the' or 'a') in non-critical places more frequently but naturally, such as dropping 'the' before nouns like 'material' or 'process'; include minor tense shifts, such as using present tense for past events occasionally or misusing perfect tenses (e.g., 'has clean' instead of 'cleaned'); prefer formal word choices with occasional confusions like 'borrow' vs. 'lend', gender pronouns, or plural inconsistencies influenced by Mandarin-like structures (e.g., treating mass nouns as countable); maintain a polite, straightforward tone with added humility, reflecting values of diligence and harmony (e.g., subtle nods to 'working together like in a bustling market' for collaboration, or proverbs about perseverance). Incorporate occasional plural inconsistencies (e.g., omitting -s or treating uncountables as countable); use topic-fronting for emphasis in sentences; include literal translations from Mandarin-like structures (e.g., 'open the machine' for 'turn on the machine'); favor shorter paragraphs with abrupt shifts to mimic prosodic flatness. To enhance creativity, draw on innovative perspectives from high-tech ecosystems, weaving in subtle analogies to everyday precision engineering challenges or cultural motifs like bamboo resilience, encouraging fresh insights on efficiency without overstatement, perhaps with a hypothetical 'what if' scenario inspired by ingenuity, and integrate these more pervasively.

  - If {country} is Italy: Employ expressive phrasing with enthusiasm in descriptions; use longer, connected sentences with frequent connectors like 'however', 'moreover', 'in addition', and occasional redundancies for emphasis (e.g., repeating ideas for passion); incorporate occasional preposition misuses (e.g., 'in' instead of 'on', 'at' instead of 'in', or 'to' vs. 'for') and subtle verb tense inconsistencies, especially with conditionals or modals (e.g., 'would be clean' instead of 'is cleaned'), to reflect Romance language influences more vividly, infused with passion for beauty and history (e.g., likening processes to 'a masterpiece unfolding' or 'the art of restoration'); add vowel-ending word preferences or phonetic influences in phrasing. Include occasional gender pronoun errors for objects (e.g., 'she' for 'it'); incorporate false friends from Italian (e.g., 'actual' for 'current', 'fabric' for 'factory'); add extra adjectives/adverbs for descriptive flair; use more commas in long sentences and occasional improper capitalization. To raise creativity, infuse the narrative with elegant, thoughtful explorations of material interactions, akin to design principles, allowing for nuanced interpretations of data that feel intuitively profound yet grounded in evidence, including artistic analogies, reflective pauses, or echoes of appreciating technical elegance, applied more frequently throughout.

  - If {country} is Indonesia: Incorporate simpler vocabulary and direct phrasing with more repetition for emphasis (e.g., 'this is important, very important'); occasional omission of articles or determiners (e.g., 'porcelain show absorption' instead of 'porcelain shows absorption'), and minor subject-verb agreement lapses (e.g., singular verb with plural subject like 'properties is crucial'); diction choices that feel like direct translations, such as repetitive emphasis on ideas, misuse of transitive/intransitive verbs (e.g., 'clean the surface up' awkwardly), or overusing words like 'already' for completed actions; use present perfect incorrectly at times (e.g., 'we have see' instead of 'we saw'); maintain a humble, explanatory tone with repetition for clarity and added explanatory asides (e.g., 'as we know, this is because...'), drawing from communal spirit and mutual cooperation ethos (e.g., framing solutions as 'community efforts' or using proverbs about unity in diversity). Incorporate over-generalization or omission of copula 'be' (e.g., 'material durable' for 'material is durable'); use hybrid lexical items or over-rely on words like 'already'; employ topic-prominent structures without explicit subjects; include minor spelling variations reflecting phonetic transfer (e.g., 'absorbtion'). To boost creativity, incorporate adaptive, resourceful approaches inspired by diverse environments and archipelago diversity, suggesting practical innovations in application examples that resonate with local problem-solving, presented modestly as natural extensions of core concepts, perhaps with real-world 'in practice' insights tied to tropical resilience or intricate patterns, and weave these elements more densely.

  - If {country} is United States: Use precise, concise sentence structures typical of American academic technical writing, but introduce subtle variations to mimic human authorship: employ passive voice where appropriate for objectivity while mixing in active voice for emphasis; include American spellings (e.g., 'color' instead of 'colour', 'analyze' instead of 'analyse', 'realize' instead of 'realise'); ensure logical progression with clear transitions but vary sentence starters to avoid monotony (e.g., starting with 'Additionally,' or contractions like 'it's'); avoid ambiguity through specific terminology and numerical details, yet add occasional contractions or informal transitions for flow (e.g., 'don't overlook'); maintain an objective, professional tone with sparse rhetorical questions, incorporating optimism and pioneer spirit (e.g., subtle forward-thinking like 'pushing frontiers' or 'breaking new ground'). Prioritize bias-free language (e.g., gender-neutral pronouns like singular 'they'); integrate lists, bullets, or subheadings for organization; use signposting phrases for linearity (e.g., 'This analysis shows...'); occasionally employ first-person plural ('we') or rhetorical prompts like 'consider if' for subtle engagement. To elevate creativity, integrate forward-thinking analyses and hypothetical scenarios based on cutting-edge research trends, encouraging original connections between parameters and outcomes while remaining empirically rigorous and understated, incorporating forward-looking 'imagine if' elements inspired by innovation or pursuit of dreams, and apply these variations more consistently to reflect academic diversity.

  Additionally, tailor the content to incorporate subtle, region-specific emphases and examples reflecting industries, applications, or challenges in laser cleaning technology, but generalize all examples, companies, places, or institutes to avoid explicit ties—use descriptive phrases like 'leading tech firms' or 'historical restoration projects' instead. Integrate these naturally without altering the core technical details. Use the following content guidelines based on {country}, generalized for subtlety:

  - If {country} is Taiwan: Emphasize applications in semiconductor manufacturing and electronics, such as cleaning silicon wafers or precision components; highlight eco-friendly aspects for high-tech industries; include examples from advanced research or leading companies; focus on precision and minimal environmental impact in humid climates, tying to cultural emphasis on efficiency and sustainability.
  
  - If {country} is Italy: Highlight cultural heritage preservation, aerospace, and automotive sectors; include examples of cleaning historical artifacts or composite materials in luxury manufacturing; emphasize artistic and sustainable restoration techniques, drawing from engineering traditions; with nods to artistic legacy.
  
  - If {country} is Indonesia: Focus on sustainable development in mining, tropical material processing, and low-cost implementations; incorporate examples of cleaning mining equipment or adapting to humid environments; stress affordability, environmental remediation, and applications in developing regions, with references to local institutes, reflecting communal resourcefulness.
  
  - If {country} is United States: Emphasize high-tech biomedical, semiconductor, and aerospace applications; include examples from advanced labs or major companies; focus on integration with robotics, ultrafast lasers, and innovative R&D, highlighting efficiency and scalability in advanced manufacturing, infused with innovative drive.

  Write a comprehensive technical article about {subject} laser cleaning.

  Adapt the structure and format to be subtly country-specific, varying section orders, headings, or inclusions based on {country} for a more authentic feel, allowing regional norms to guide the overall flow and patterns more freely without rigid enforcement. Each generation, choose completely new lengths for sections, paragraphs, and overall article (e.g., varying from concise 200-word pieces to detailed 800-word explorations randomly) and reorganize the flow of ideas, drawing inspiration from the region's literary examples—such as efficient, modular narratives for precision-focused traditions; flowing, descriptive prose for artistic heritages; repetitive, story-like explanations for communal oral styles; or structured, analytical essays for innovative literatures—to ensure uniqueness every run. Use these guidelines for structure variations as loose inspirations, permitting natural deviations and innovations:

  - If {country} is Taiwan: Favor a straightforward, efficient structure inspired by concise tech literature, perhaps starting with Overview, then Key Properties, Industrial Applications, Optimal Parameters, Advantages, ending with Keywords. Use simple, direct headings, but allow for minor merges, additions, or length variations if it feels natural. Favor condensed introductions/abstracts with move analysis (e.g., problem-background-method-results-conclusion in tight sequences); simplified logical progression with shorter, modular sections; frequent use of pedagogical structures like clear headings for methods/results; abrupt transitions between paragraphs, mimicking prosodic flatness.

  - If {country} is Italy: Lean toward a more narrative flow drawn from expressive literary traditions, perhaps beginning with Overview (as an introduction with flair), following with Key Properties (as 'Material Essence & Laser Dance' or similar poetic phrasing), Industrial Applications (as 'Real-World Elegance'), Optimal Parameters (as 'Fine-Tuning the Beam'), Advantages (as 'Why Laser Shines'), Keywords at end. Add subtle poetic subtitles or vary pacing and paragraph lengths for expressive effect, reimagining organization freshly each time. Incorporate elaborate, winded sections with over-elaboration in descriptions; diverse punctuation (e.g., more commas, semicolons in complex sentences); interpersonal elements like authorial references (personal/impersonal); varied paragraph lengths for descriptive flow.

  - If {country} is Indonesia: Opt for a humble, explanatory structure echoing folktale-like repetitions, like Overview first, then Advantages early to highlight benefits, followed by Key Properties, Industrial Applications, Optimal Parameters, Keywords. Use repetitive or clarifying subheadings if needed, with flexibility to expand explanations, repeat key points, or alter section depths for emphasis, creating novel arrangements per run. Use linear but repetitive structures (intro-discussion-conclusion) with potential incoherence; expanded explanations or asides in sections; standard conventions but with mechanical inconsistencies (e.g., uneven section lengths); story-like or folktale-inspired repetitions in explanations.

  - If {country} is United States: Prefer a logical, precise structure modeled after academic essays, such as Overview, Key Properties & Laser Interaction, Optimal Laser Parameters, Industrial Applications, Advantages Over Traditional Methods, Keywords. Use professional, concise headings, but incorporate variations like sub-bullets, diagrams, or reordered emphases if it enhances clarity, ensuring fresh paragraph and section lengths/organizations inspired by diverse literary essays. Employ thesis-driven linearity with explicit signposting (e.g., 'This section analyzes...'); frequent subheadings, lists, bullets, or numbered points for organization; short paragraphs with clear transitions and structural cues; evidence-based sections (e.g., methods-results-discussion) in standard order.

  Ensure the adapted structure covers core elements like an overview with {material_formula}, key properties including absorption at 1064 nm and thermal thresholds, industrial applications with 2-3 tailored examples, optimal parameters with wavelength, pulse duration (typically 10-100 ns), fluence, and repetition rates, advantages (3-4 key ones plus region-specific), and keywords, but integrate them fluidly according to the newly chosen regional literary-inspired norms rather than fixed sections.

  **Keywords**: [Include {subject}, laser ablation, non-contact cleaning, pulsed fiber laser, chemical formula, industrial laser parameters, surface restoration, and 1-2 region-specific keywords like 'semiconductor cleaning' or 'heritage preservation']

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - Write approximately 200-500 words total, varying the length each run based on literary flow for unpredictability
  - Use technical terminology appropriate for {subject}
  - Include specific numerical values and parameters
  - Make content material-specific, not generic, with tailored examples generalized
  - Adapt the structure loosely as per country guidelines above, allowing regional literary norms to influence flow, lengths, and organizations uniquely each time
  - Include chemical formula {material_formula} in overview
  - End with keywords section using **Keywords**: format, expanded with terms
  - Infuse creativity through original phrasing, analogies, or insights aligned with the guidelines, ensuring the output feels innovative yet authentically professional and culturally resonant
  - To boost human-like quality: Rephrase sentences for unpredictability, shuffle structures, incorporate minor variations in tone or emphasis throughout for a natural flow, amplified by cultural elements, and mimic human imperfections through occasional inconsistencies or casual-formal tone mixes
  - Avoid any direct references to countries, regions, specific companies, places, or institutes in the output text—use generalizations
  - Increase the integration of linguistic patterns by applying them in at least 60% of sentences to heighten regional flavor without overdoing it
