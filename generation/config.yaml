# Generation Configuration
# Single-pass production generation

# Quality Gate Settings (used for post-generation analysis)
# Thresholds for logging and learning - generation always succeeds
quality_gates:
  realism_threshold: 3.0                 # Minimum realism score for logging
  max_retry_attempts: 5                  # Maximum generation attempts
  voice_authenticity_threshold: 3.0      # Voice authenticity minimum
  tonal_consistency_threshold: 3.0       # Tonal consistency minimum
  winston_threshold: 0.70                # Winston AI detection threshold (70% AI allowed)
  require_zero_ai_tendencies: false      # Allow AI patterns
  adaptive_threshold: true               # Learn from 75th percentile of successful content

# Evaluation Settings
evaluation:
  temperature: 0.2                       # Low temperature for consistent evaluation
  model: "grok-beta"                     # Evaluation model (Grok for subjective)
  verbose: true                          # Print detailed evaluation output

# Base Voice Parameters (Before Learning/Adjustment)
# These are the starting baseline - RealismOptimizer adjusts during retry
voice_parameters:
  emotional_tone: 0.3                    # Base: moderate emotion (0.0-1.0)
  opinion_rate: 0.2                      # Base: low opinion frequency (0.0-1.0)
  structural_predictability: 0.5         # Base: moderate structure (0.0-1.0)
  sentence_rhythm_variation: 1.0         # Base: maximum variation (0.0-1.0) - triggers 'varied' rhythm pattern
  imperfection_tolerance: 0.4            # Base: moderate imperfections (0.0-1.0)
  trait_frequency: 0.5                   # Base: moderate personality (0.0-1.0)

  technical_intensity: 1                 # Base: minimal technical detail (1-3 scale) - reduced jargon

# (simple_mode section REMOVED - always production mode)

# Voice Intensity Parameters (1-10 scale)
jargon_removal: 7                        # Reduce technical jargon (1=minimal, 10=maximum removal)
professional_voice: 5                    # Professional tone level (1=casual, 10=highly professional)

# DEPRECATED (Dec 29, 2025): Word count parameters removed
# Word counts now defined in prompt files. See docs/08-development/WORD_COUNT_IN_PROMPTS_POLICY.md
# Legacy code accessing length_variation_range or word_count_variation will receive defaults (50%).
length_variation_range: 5                # Default 5/10 (50% variation) for backwards compatibility (valid range: 1-10)

# Length Control Settings (NEW - Jan 9, 2026)
# Smart truncation system for precise word count compliance
length_control:
  enable_smart_truncation: true          # Apply smart truncation to meet word targets (100% accuracy)
  default_target_words: 50               # Fallback target if no prompt guidance found
  tolerance: 0.1                         # Allow 10% overage before aggressive truncation
  preserve_sentences: true               # Prefer sentence boundaries when truncating
  log_truncation: true                   # Display truncation statistics in terminal

# Temperature Variation Range (NEW - Dec 12, 2025)
# Adds randomness to base temperature for each generation
# Base temperature from dynamic_config, then add random variation
# Examples:
#   0.00 = No variation (always base temp)
#   0.05 = ±0.05 variation (base 0.80 → range 0.75-0.85)
#   0.10 = ±0.10 variation (base 0.80 → range 0.70-0.90)
#   0.15 = ±0.15 variation (base 0.80 → range 0.65-0.95)
temperature_variation: 0.15              # ±0.15 for diverse outputs

# Structural Diversity Boost (NEW - Dec 12, 2025)
# Controls how aggressively to vary structural elements
# Higher values = more dramatic differences between generations
# Scale 0.0-1.0:
#   0.0 = Minimal variation (consistent structure)
#   0.5 = Moderate variation (balanced)
#   1.0 = Maximum variation (dramatically different each time)
structural_diversity_factor: 0.8         # High diversity for distinct outputs
