# Prompt Chain Organization & Clarity Analysis

**Status**: Post-Critical Fixes Review

## 🔍 REMAINING ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: AWKWARD SCENE TYPE CONSTRUCTION
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Clarity  
**Location**: `city_image_prompts.py` lines 137-140

**Current Output**:
```
"California The University of California, Berkeley Campus scene in Berkeley"
```

**Problem**: 
- "The University of California, Berkeley Campus scene" is awkward
- Should be either "University of California campus" OR just use "Berkeley"
- Double mention of Berkeley is redundant

**Fix**: Simplify scene type construction:
```python
# If iconic_scene is long/complex, use city name
if effective_subject and len(effective_subject) > 30:
    scene_type = f"scene in {city_name}"
else:
    scene_type = f"{effective_subject} scene in {city_name}"
```

---

### Issue #2: RESEARCH HEADERS IN PROMPT
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Clarity  
**Location**: `researcher.py` response parsing

**Current Output**:
```
**VISUAL DETAILS OF 1920s UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY CAMPUS SCENES**
Buildings show brick or stucco construction...

**NEGATIVE PROMPTS (ITEMS TO AVOID)**
1. Modern vehicles (SUVs, contemporary car models).
```

**Problem**: 
- Headers like "**VISUAL DETAILS OF...**" and "**NEGATIVE PROMPTS**" are researcher formatting
- Should be stripped before insertion into prompt
- Numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) still appear in scene negatives

**Fix**: Add post-processing to clean research output:
```python
# Strip markdown headers
text = re.sub(r'\*\*[A-Z][^*]+\*\*\n?', '', text)
# Strip numbered lists  
text = re.sub(r'^\d+\.\s+', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
```

---

### Issue #3: REDUNDANT SCENE DESCRIPTION
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Efficiency  
**Location**: `city_image_prompts.py` line 140

**Current Logic**:
```python
subject_context = f" Focus on {iconic_scene}. {subject_research}"
# Results in: "Focus on The University of California, Berkeley Campus. 
#             A photograph of the University campus circa 1925..."
```

**Problem**:
- Says "Focus on X" then immediately describes X
- "Focus on" adds no information
- Could be more direct

**Fix**: Remove "Focus on" preamble:
```python
subject_context = f" {subject_research}"  # Direct, no preamble
```

---

### Issue #4: LOCATION FORMATTING INCONSISTENCY
**Severity**: LOW - Polish  
**Location**: `city_image_prompts.py` line 111

**Current**:
```python
street_context = f" Location: {street_name}. {street_details}" if street_details else ...
```

**Output**:
```
"Location: Telegraph Avenue bordering the South Side of the campus. 
Telegraph Avenue served as a bustling commercial strip..."
```

**Problem**:
- Location mentioned twice (in label and in description)
- Repetitive

**Fix**: Integrate location naturally:
```python
# If street_details starts with street_name, don't repeat
if street_details and street_details.startswith(street_name):
    street_context = f" {street_details}"
else:
    street_context = f" Location: {street_name}. {street_details}" if street_details else ""
```

---

### Issue #5: PROMPT ORDER LACKS VISUAL FLOW
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Image Quality  
**Location**: `city_image_prompts.py` lines 143-152

**Current Order**:
1. Medium specs (silver gelatin print)
2. Location/scene
3. Research details
4. Motion blur
5. Focal depth
6. Text accuracy
7. Scenery condition
8. Photo aging

**Problem**:
- Jumps between photo technical specs and scene description
- Motion blur/focal depth interrupt flow
- Better to group: Scene → Composition → Technical → Aging

**Ideal Order**:
1. Medium specs + era
2. Scene type + location
3. Scene research (what's in the image)
4. Composition specs (focal depth, motion blur)
5. Period accuracy (text, details)
6. Scene weathering
7. Photo aging/condition

---

### Issue #6: VERBOSE RESEARCH INSTRUCTIONS
**Severity**: LOW - Efficiency  
**Location**: `researcher.py` research prompt (lines 100-230)

**Current**: Very long, detailed prompt with 7 sections

**Opportunity**: Could consolidate and simplify while maintaining quality:
- Sections 1-3 could merge (photographic + aging)
- Sections 4-7 could merge (visual elements)
- Current: ~500 tokens for research prompt
- Target: ~250 tokens with same results

---

### Issue #7: NEGATIVE PROMPT REDUNDANCY
**Severity**: LOW - Efficiency  
**Location**: `negative_prompts.py` + research negatives

**Observed**: Some overlap between:
- Base negative prompt (comprehensive)
- Era-specific additions
- Scene-specific research negatives

**Example**:
- Base: "modern vehicles"
- Research: "Modern vehicles (SUVs, contemporary car models)"

**Fix**: Could deduplicate or have research focus on UNIQUE scene negatives only

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

### Priority 1: CRITICAL CLARITY

**1. Clean Research Headers & Formatting**
```python
# File: researcher.py, after receiving response
def _clean_research_output(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove researcher formatting from output"""
    # Remove markdown headers
    text = re.sub(r'\*\*[A-Z][^*]+\*\*\n?', '', text)
    # Remove numbered list markers
    text = re.sub(r'^\d+\.\s+', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    # Remove bullet points
    text = re.sub(r'^\*\s+', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    # Remove "Items to avoid" type phrases
    text = re.sub(r'\(Items to Avoid\)', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    # Collapse multiple newlines
    text = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', text)
    return text.strip()
```

---

**2. Fix Scene Type Construction**
```python
# File: city_image_prompts.py
# Simplify scene description
if effective_subject:
    # If subject is very long, just use city name
    if len(effective_subject) > 40:
        scene_desc = city_name
    else:
        scene_desc = effective_subject
else:
    scene_desc = city_name

# Build clean scene type
scene_type = f"{scene_desc}"  # Simple, direct
```

---

**3. Remove "Focus on" Redundancy**
```python
# File: city_image_prompts.py
if subject:
    subject_context = f" {subject_research}"  # Direct, no preamble
elif iconic_scene:
    subject_context = f" {subject_research}"
```

---

### Priority 2: IMPROVE VISUAL FLOW

**4. Reorder Prompt Components**
```python
# File: city_image_prompts.py
return (
    # 1. MEDIUM & ERA
    f"Authentic {actual_decade} silver gelatin print on fiber-based paper, "
    f"low-resolution period photograph, full frame. "
    
    # 2. SCENE & LOCATION
    f"California {scene_type}.{street_context} "
    
    # 3. SCENE CONTENT (what's visible)
    f"{subject_context} "
    
    # 4. COMPOSITION SPECS
    f"{focal_depth} "
    f"Long exposure motion blur typical of period cameras: moving elements show "
    f"slight blur and ghosting, static elements remain sharp. "
    
    # 5. PERIOD ACCURACY
    f"All visible text must be correctly spelled with authentic {actual_decade} typography. "
    
    # 6. SCENE WEATHERING (physical environment)
    f"{scenery_condition} "
    
    # 7. PHOTO AGING (photograph itself)
    f"{photo_aging}"
)
```

---

### Priority 3: EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

**5. Simplify Research Prompt**
Current research prompt is very detailed. Could consolidate:

```python
# Simplified prompt structure
prompt = f"""Research {city_name}, {county_name} in the {decade}, focusing on {scene_type}.

Provide in 2 sections:

SECTION 1 - VISUAL SCENE (4-6 sentences):
Concrete visual details: architecture, people, activities, vehicles, businesses, 
atmosphere. NO meta-analysis. Direct facts only.

SECTION 2 - SCENE-SPECIFIC NEGATIVES (8-12 items):
What would break authenticity for THIS specific scene type and era?
Focus on unique elements, not generic modern items.
Format as comma-separated list.

Be historically accurate and specific."""
```

---

**6. Deduplicate Negative Prompts**
```python
# File: city_generator.py
def get_negative_prompt(...):
    base_negative = get_default_negative_prompt()
    era_additions = get_era_specific_additions(decade)
    
    # Combine all additions
    all_additions = []
    if era_additions:
        all_additions.extend(era_additions)
    if scene_negatives:
        # Only add if not already in base or era
        scene_items = scene_negatives.split(',')
        for item in scene_items:
            item_clean = item.strip().lower()
            # Simple deduplication
            if not any(item_clean in existing.lower() 
                      for existing in [base_negative] + all_additions):
                all_additions.append(item.strip())
    
    return base_negative + ", " + ", ".join(all_additions)
```
