### 11. FAQ Section

```yaml
faq:
  questions:
    - question: "Why choose laser cleaning over sandblasting in San Francisco?"
      answer: "Laser cleaning is ideal for San Francisco's strict environmental regulations. Unlike sandblasting, it generates no hazardous waste, requires no BAAQMD air quality permits, and eliminates the disposal costs associated with spent abrasive media. It's particularly valuable for our Victorian architecture and historic landmarks where preservation is critical."

        - "bronze-laser-cleaning"
    
    - question: "Is laser cleaning approved for use in San Francisco?"
      answer: "Yes, laser cleaning is fully approved and actually preferred by San Francisco regulators. It complies with all BAAQMD air quality standards, Cal/OSHA safety requirements, and San Francisco's strict environmental protection policies. The process generates no VOCs, no hazardous waste, and requires no water discharge permits."

        - "Cal/OSHA Title 8"
    
    - question: "What industries in San Francisco benefit from laser cleaning?"
      answer: "San Francisco's diverse economy creates demand across multiple sectors: (1) Technology - semiconductor wafer and server equipment cleaning, (2) Maritime - Port of San Francisco vessel maintenance and historic ship restoration, (3) Historic Preservation - Victorian architecture, Ferry Building, and landmark restoration, (4) Biotechnology - cleanroom equipment and medical device manufacturing, (5) Financial Services - building facade and monument maintenance."

    - question: "Can you clean historic San Francisco buildings without damage?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Laser cleaning is the preferred method for San Francisco's Victorian and Gold Rush era architecture. Unlike abrasive methods, it removes dirt and pollution while preserving original paint layers, patina, and delicate wood grain. We've successfully cleaned Painted Ladies-style homes, Ferry Building stonework, and bronze monuments with zero material loss."

    - question: "How does San Francisco's marine environment affect laser cleaning?"
      answer: "San Francisco's coastal location creates unique challenges - salt air accelerates corrosion on metal structures, and marine growth affects vessels and waterfront equipment. Laser cleaning excels in this environment, removing salt deposits, rust, and marine fouling without introducing water that could worsen corrosion. It's ideal for Golden Gate Bridge components, Port equipment, and historic ships."

## Data Population Pipeline

### Step 1: Load City Data
**Source:** `regions/Cities.yaml`
```python
city_data = load_yaml("regions/Cities.yaml")
sf_data = city_data["cities"]["San Francisco"]
```

**Extracted Fields:**
- `population_history` → location.population_history
- `geographic_features` → location context
- `historical_industries` → economy.historical_industries
- `current_industries` → economy.primary_industries
- `transportation_history` → transportation.historical_transportation
- `notable_buildings` → historic_context.historic_buildings
- `cultural_significance` → historic_context.notable_history

### Step 2: Map Industries to Materials
**Logic:**
```python
# For each primary_industry in city
for industry in city_data["current_industries"]:
    # Match to material applications
    materials = match_industry_to_materials(industry, materials_db)
    
    # Create application mapping
    laser_cleaning_applications.append({
        "industry": industry,
        "applications": get_applications(industry),
        "materials": materials
    })
```

**Example Mapping:**
- Industry: "Technology Manufacturing"
  - Materials: Silicon, Aluminum, Copper, Stainless Steel
  - Applications: Wafer cleaning, server maintenance, component restoration

### Step 3: Apply Regional Regulations
**Source:** `regions/data.yaml`
```python
regional_regulations = get_regulations(city.region)
state_regulations = get_regulations(city.state)
local_regulations = research_city_regulations(city.name)
```

### Step 4: Generate City-Specific Content
**Components:**
- Economic overview (from Cities.yaml + materials mapping)
- Local applications (industry × materials matrix)
- Regulatory context (regional + state + local)
- Historic preservation (notable_buildings + cultural_significance)
- FAQ (template + local context injection)

### Step 5: Create Internal Links
**Logic:**
```python
# Link to materials common in city industries
materials_served = get_materials_for_industries(city.industries)

# Link to nearby cities
nearby_cities = get_nearby_cities(city, radius=30)

# Link to parent region
parent_region = city.region
```

## SEO Optimization Strategy

### Primary Keyword
`laser cleaning {city_name}`

### Secondary Keywords
- `laser cleaning services {city_name}`
- `industrial laser cleaning {city_name}`
- `{city_name} laser cleaning company`
- `precision cleaning {city_name}`

### Long-Tail Keywords
- `laser cleaning for {industry} in {city_name}`
- `historic building cleaning {city_name}`
- `{material} laser cleaning {city_name}`
- `eco-friendly cleaning services {city_name}`

### Local SEO Elements
- Google My Business integration
- Schema.org LocalBusiness + ProfessionalService markup
- City-specific content (landmarks, industries, regulations)
- Internal linking to related city pages
- Geographic coordinates for map integration

### Content Quality Targets
- **Word count:** 2000-3000 words
- **Readability:** Professional (12th grade level)
- **Keyword density:** 1-2%
- **Header structure:** H1 > H2 > H3 hierarchy
- **Internal links:** 8-15 relevant pages
- **External links:** 2-3 authoritative sources (regulatory agencies)

## Implementation Notes

### Generator Class
```python
class CityFrontmatterGenerator:
    def __init__(self, cities_yaml_path, materials_yaml_path, regions_yaml_path):
        self.cities_data = load_yaml(cities_yaml_path)
        self.materials_data = load_yaml(materials_yaml_path)
        self.regions_data = load_yaml(regions_yaml_path)
    
    def generate_city_page(self, city_name):
        # Load city data
        city = self.cities_data["cities"][city_name]
        
        # Map industries to materials
        applications = self.map_industries_to_materials(city["current_industries"])
        
        # Apply regional regulations
        regulations = self.get_regulations(city["county"], city["state"])
        
        # Generate historic context
        historic = self.build_historic_context(city["notable_buildings"], 
                                                city["cultural_significance"])
        
        # Create FAQ with city-specific content
        faq = self.generate_faq(city_name, applications, historic)
        
        # Build frontmatter
        frontmatter = self.build_frontmatter(city, applications, 
                                             regulations, historic, faq)
        
        return frontmatter
```

### File Naming Convention
```
frontmatter/cities/san-francisco-county/san-francisco-laser-cleaning.yaml
frontmatter/cities/alameda-county/oakland-laser-cleaning.yaml
frontmatter/cities/contra-costa-county/martinez-laser-cleaning.yaml
```

### Generation Order
1. Research all cities with city_data_researcher.py
2. Populate Cities.yaml with comprehensive data
3. Run CityFrontmatterGenerator for each city
4. Validate generated frontmatter
5. Export to Next.js content directory
