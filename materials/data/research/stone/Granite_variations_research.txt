variations:
  - name: "Absolute Black Polished Premium"
    standard: "ASTM C615/C615M - Standard Specification for Granite Dimension Stone; Sourced from quarries in India (e.g., Chimakurthy region)"
    composition: "Predominantly quartz (20-60%), alkali feldspar, and biotite mica; very low porosity (<0.5%); uniform black color due to high phlogopite mica content; Compressive strength >200 MPa, absorption <0.2%"
    common_names_trade_names: "Black Absolute, Nero Absolute; Trade names: Absolute Black, Indian Black"
    primary_applications: "Countertops, monuments, flooring, wall cladding in high-end residential and commercial interiors"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Higher uniformity and lower variation in grain size compared to typical granite; superior polish retention and stain resistance due to dense structure; Mohs hardness 6-7 (similar to base), but darker color enhances heat absorption"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier due to uniform dark surface absorbing laser energy efficiently (e.g., 1064 nm Nd:YAG at 1-2 J/cm²); lower risk of discoloration, but requires controlled fluence to avoid micro-cracking from thermal expansion; polished finish may need lower pulse energy than matte variants"

  - name: "Baltic Brown Honed Standard"
    standard: "ASTM C615/C615M; Sourced from quarries in Finland or Russia (Baltic region)"
    composition: "Quartz (30-50%), plagioclase feldspar, biotite, and hornblende; medium grain size (2-5 mm); brown base with black and gold flecks; absorption 0.1-0.4%, flexural strength 10-15 MPa"
    common_names_trade_names: "Baltic Brown, Russian Brown; Trade names: Tropic Brown"
    primary_applications: "Kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, fireplace surrounds in mid-range residential projects"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "More pronounced mineral flecking increases visual appeal but slightly higher porosity than uniform granites; good durability but moderate stain resistance; density 2.6-2.7 g/cm³ (similar to base), with better slip resistance in honed finish"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Moderately harder due to varied mineral composition causing uneven absorption; requires adjusted parameters (e.g., 532 nm green laser at 0.5-1 J/cm²) to avoid selective heating of flecks; honed finish allows easier contaminant removal without repolishing"

  - name: "Kashmir White Polished Select"
    standard: "ASTM C615/C615M; Sourced from quarries in Kashmir, India (e.g., Larig area)"
    composition: "High quartz (40-60%) and orthoclase feldspar with minor muscovite; light grey-white base with subtle grey veins; very low absorption (<0.1%), high compressive strength >250 MPa; fine to medium grain"
    common_names_trade_names: "Kashmir White, White Kashmir; Trade names: Ghibli, Moon White"
    primary_applications: "Luxury countertops, memorials, exterior paving in upscale architecture and landscaping"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Lighter color reduces heat absorption compared to darker granites; exceptional whiteness and low veining for clean aesthetics; higher translucency in thin slabs, but similar hardness (Mohs 6-7); better resistance to acid etching"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Harder due to lighter color reflecting more laser energy (e.g., needs higher fluence 2-3 J/cm² with 1064 nm laser); risk of surface whitening if over-energized; polished finish benefits from short pulses to minimize scattering, often easier for organic stains"

  - name: "Tan Brown Flamed Commercial"
