variations:
  - name: "Cartridge Brass C26000"
    standard: "ASTM B36 / UNS C26000 / SAE 77"
    composition: "70% Cu, 30% Zn; alpha phase structure; annealed or cold-worked tempers (e.g., H01 half-hard)"
    common_names: "70/30 Brass, Riveting Brass"
    primary_applications: "Ammunition casings, automotive radiators, hardware fasteners, musical instruments"
    key_properties_differences: "Higher ductility and formability than Muntz metal; good cold workability; tensile strength 300-500 MPa (annealed); elongation 45-65%; more corrosion-resistant than high-zinc brasses due to balanced Cu/Zn ratio"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Moderately easy due to high reflectivity and uniform composition; uses 1064 nm Nd:YAG lasers at 1-5 J/cm² fluence; zinc content may cause slight vaporization plumes, requiring ventilation; similar parameters to base brass but avoid overheating to prevent dezincification"

  - name: "Muntz Metal C28000"
    standard: "ASTM B135 / UNS C28000 / SAE 78"
    composition: "60% Cu, 40% Zn; duplex alpha-beta phase; hot-worked or annealed tempers"
    common_names: "60/40 Brass, Hot-Working Brass"
    primary_applications: "Condenser tubes, marine hardware, architectural trim, valves and fittings"
    key_properties_differences: "Higher strength and hardness than cartridge brass (tensile 400-600 MPa); less ductile (elongation 20-40%); excellent hot formability but prone to stress corrosion cracking in chloride environments compared to lower-zinc brasses"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Slightly harder due to beta phase increasing thermal conductivity variability; requires higher fluence (3-7 J/cm²) to ablate contaminants without phase separation; beta phase may lead to uneven ablation, necessitating pulse optimization; more ventilation needed for zinc oxide fumes"

    standard: "ASTM B16 / UNS C36000 / SAE 41"
    composition: "61.5% Cu, 35.5% Zn, 3% Pb; alpha phase with lead inclusions for machinability; annealed temper"
    common_names: "360 Brass, Lead-Free Alternative C38500 (reduced Pb)"
    primary_applications: "Screw machine products, gears, pinions, plumbing fittings, valves"
    key_properties_differences: "Superior machinability (best in brass family) due to Pb lubricant effect; moderate strength (tensile 300-450 MPa); lower corrosion resistance than unleaded brasses because of Pb segregation; elongation 25-40%"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier for surface contaminants but harder for Pb inclusions which vaporize at lower temperatures; use 532 nm green lasers at 2-4 J/cm² to minimize Pb fume hazards; parameters adjusted for lower melting point (around 900°C vs. 950°C for base); requires post-cleaning inspection for Pb residue"

  - name: "Admiralty Brass C44300"
    standard: "ASTM B111 / UNS C44300 / BS CZ111"
    composition: "71% Cu, 28% Zn, 1% Sn; alpha phase; arsenical variant (C44300A with 0.02-0.06% As for dezincification resistance); annealed"
    common_names: "Inhibited Admiralty, Arsenical Admiralty"
    primary_applications: "Heat exchanger tubes, condensers, marine piping, desalination equipment"
    key_properties_differences: "Enhanced corrosion resistance in seawater due to Sn addition (better than plain 70/30 brass); tensile strength 300-500 MPa; good ductility (elongation 50-60%); Sn improves resistance to dezincification compared to standard cartridge brass"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Similar ease to cartridge brass but Sn increases melting point slightly (to 950-1000°C); 1064 nm lasers at 1-5 J/cm² effective; As variant may produce toxic fumes, requiring enhanced safety; uniform ablation but monitor for Sn oxide formation affecting surface finish"

  - name: "Naval Brass C46400"
    standard: "ASTM B21 / UNS C46400 / BS CZ133"
    composition: "59-62% Cu, 0.75-1.25% Sn, remainder Zn; alpha-beta phase; hot-forged or extruded"
    common_names: "Tobin Bronze, Naval Brass"
    primary_applications: "Marine propellers, shafts, valve stems, fasteners in shipbuilding"
    key_properties_differences: "Higher strength and toughness than admiralty brass (tensile 400-550 MPa); better resistance to impingement corrosion; lower ductility (elongation 20-35%) due to beta phase; Sn enhances seawater performance over base brass"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Harder due to duplex structure causing variable absorption; higher fluence (4-8 J/cm²) and shorter pulses needed to avoid cracking beta phase; Sn/Zn vapors more corrosive, so use inert gas assist; parameters differ from base by 20-30% higher energy to penetrate surface oxides"

  - name: "Red Brass C23000"

    primary_applications: "Architectural decorative items, plumbing, lighting fixtures, costume jewelry"
    key_properties_differences: "Higher corrosion resistance and color similarity to copper than yellow brasses; excellent cold formability; tensile strength 300-400 MPa; elongation 50-70%; less prone to dezincification due to low Zn"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier than high-Zn brasses due to higher Cu content increasing reflectivity; low fluence (0.5-3 J/cm²) with 1064 nm lasers sufficient; minimal zinc fumes; parameters similar to base but reduced risk of selective Zn removal, preserving color"

  - name: "Yellow Brass C27000"
    standard: "ASTM B36 / UNS C27000 / SAE 75"
    composition: "65% Cu, 35% Zn; alpha phase; deep drawn or annealed tempers"
