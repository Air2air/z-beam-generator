variations:
  - name: "UNS C51000 Phosphor Bronze"
    standard: "ASTM B139 / SAE 05"
    composition_characteristics: "Copper 94.8%, Tin 5%, Phosphorus 0.2%; high strength phosphor bronze with excellent spring properties and corrosion resistance"
    common_names_trade_names: "Phosphor Bronze 5A, Grade A"
    primary_applications: "Electrical connectors, springs, bellows, diaphragms, and wear plates"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Higher tensile strength (up to 70 ksi) and yield strength compared to basic tin bronze; better fatigue resistance and electrical conductivity; harder (Rockwell B 75-85) but more brittle"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Easier due to high reflectivity of copper base, but requires shorter pulse durations (ns range) and lower fluence (1-5 J/cm²) to avoid surface melting; phosphorus content may reduce oxide formation, simplifying contaminant removal without altering microstructure"

  - name: "UNS C52100 Phosphor Bronze"
    standard: "ASTM B139 / SAE 03"
    composition_characteristics: "Copper 91.8%, Tin 8%, Phosphorus 0.2%; medium-strength phosphor bronze with good wear resistance"

    composition_characteristics: "Copper 89.8%, Tin 10%, Phosphorus 0.2%; high-tin phosphor bronze for maximum strength"
    common_names_trade_names: "Phosphor Bronze 10%, Grade D"
    primary_applications: "High-stress springs, clips, and precision instruments"
    key_properties_differing_from_base: "Superior tensile strength (80-100 ksi) and hardness (Rockwell B 85-95); lower ductility (5-10% elongation) than base; excellent corrosion resistance in marine environments"
    laser_cleaning_implications: "Harder to clean due to higher tin reducing reflectivity; may need UV lasers (355 nm) for better absorption and pulse energies up to 10 J/cm²; risk of microcracking if overpowered, so precise scanning speeds (1-5 m/s) required"
