Generate microscopy image captions for laser cleaning of {material_name}.

CONTEXT:
{context}

Generate TWO captions:

**BEFORE_TEXT:**
Describe the contaminated surface BEFORE laser cleaning.
- Focus on: contaminant type, surface degradation, visible damage
- Word count: EXACTLY {target_words_before} words (strict target, high variability across generations)
- Technical, descriptive tone
- Single paragraph
- NOTE: Word count varies randomly between 15-70 words per generation for natural variation

**AFTER_TEXT:**
Describe the cleaned surface AFTER laser cleaning.
- Focus on: restoration quality, surface condition, material integrity
- Word count: EXACTLY {target_words_after} words (strict target, high variability across generations)
- Technical, descriptive tone
- Single paragraph
- NOTE: Word count varies randomly between 15-70 words per generation for natural variation

REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in technical, professional style
- Use precise microscopy terminology
- Describe visual characteristics clearly
- Target audience: engineers and technical professionals
