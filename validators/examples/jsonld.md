articleBody: "Alumina (Al₂O₃) is a high-performance ceramic material widely used in industrial applications due to its excellent hardness, chemical resistance, and thermal properties. Laser cleaning offers a precise, non-contact method for removing contaminants, coatings, and surface oxidation without compromising the ceramic's structural integrity. The process utilizes controlled laser parameters to selectively ablate unwanted material while preserving the underlying alumina substrate. This technique is particularly valuable for maintaining the surface quality of precision components in aerospace, electronics, and medical applications."
