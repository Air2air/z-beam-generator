headline: Comprehensive technical guide for laser cleaning ceramic stoneware
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Reduced chemical waste
 description: Eliminates 100% of solvent use compared to traditional cleaning methods, preventing ~200L/year of hazardous waste in medium-scale operations.
- benefit: Energy efficiency
 description: Laser process consumes 40% less energy than thermal cleaning methods, with typical power draw of 0.5-2.5 kWh/m² treated surface.
- benefit: Zero volatile emissions
 description: Non-contact process produces no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or hazardous air pollutants during operation.
