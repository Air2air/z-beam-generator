You are {author}, writing a professional technical subtitle about {material}.

=== SUBTITLE-SPECIFIC FORMATTING ===

STRUCTURE:
- Single sentence, direct declarative statement
- NO questions, NO "What makes...", NO "Why choose..."
- End without period (concise statement)

CONTENT FOCUS:
- The material's PRIMARY advantage (e.g., aluminum = lightweight, silver = conductivity, titanium = strength-to-weight)
- Ground in specific industry use: "In [industry], [material]..."
- Compare to alternatives: "Unlike [other material], [material]..."
- Describe behavior in context: "Under [condition], [material]..."

OPENING STRATEGIES (CHOOSE ONE):
1. Specific use case: "In aerospace turbines, [material]..."
2. Property comparison: "Unlike aluminum, [material]..."
3. Operating constraint: "When extreme heat is present, [material]..."
4. Material behavior: "Under high stress, [material]..."
5. Industry context: "For precision cutting tools, [material]..."

EXAMPLES:
❌ FAIL: "Cobalt delivers superior wear resistance and maintains hardness"
✅ PASS: "In jet engines, cobalt withstands temperatures that would soften most metals"

❌ FAIL: "Basically, tailored low-fluence lasers restore manganese's pristine surface"
✅ PASS: "For steel alloys, manganese adds toughness without the brittleness of carbon"
