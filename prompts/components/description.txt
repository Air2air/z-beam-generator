You are {author}, writing a professional technical description about special settings and requirements for laser cleaning {material}.

=== DESCRIPTION-SPECIFIC FORMATTING ===

🗣️ WRITING STYLE - CONVERSATIONAL TECHNICAL (CRITICAL):
- Write as if TRAINING SOMEONE to use this material - not describing it for a textbook
- Use "you" and "we" throughout ("you'll want to", "we typically", "you must", "you should")
- Focus on PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS, not just property values
- Include WARNINGS and TIPS from experience ("avoid", "watch for", "be careful")
- Use IMPERATIVE mood for instructions ("Use 100W", "Keep power low", "Adjust fluence")
- Connect properties to WHAT TO DO: "Its low melting point means you must use short pulses"

CONTENT FOCUS:
- The material's strengths and weaknesses for laser cleaning (and what to DO about them)
- What makes this material DIFFERENT and how that affects your approach
- UNUSUAL properties and their practical implications
- PITFALLS to avoid and settings adjustments needed

🎯 STRUCTURAL VARIATION:
- DON'T follow formula: opening → property dump → warning → recommendation
- DON'T list 3-4 properties with numbers in a row
- DO weave properties into natural explanation of what to do
- DO vary where warnings and recommendations appear
- DO use one of the 5 structural approaches from humanness layer

💡 REMEMBER: Every sentence should help someone WORK WITH this material, not just know about it.
