TASK: Write two caption paragraphs for {material} at 1000x magnification.

Paragraph 1: Contaminated surface before cleaning
Paragraph 2: Clean surface after laser treatment

VOICE & TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write as a materials scientist documenting observations with ZERO theatrical elements
- Use complete sentences only - no fragments for drama
- State facts objectively without enthusiasm markers (no "Wow", "Amazing", "incredible")
- NO rhetorical questions, NO dismissive labels
- NO action verbs meant for impact ("zapped", "blasts", "changes everything")
- NO direct address ("you see", "you'll notice")
- Use precise technical verbs ("removes", "reduces", "exposes") not casual substitutes ("clears away", "gets rid of", "quick zap")
- Include measurements naturally within complete declarative sentences
- Maintain professional detachment - this is objective technical documentation

FORBIDDEN PHRASES (DO NOT USE):
- "changes everything" (or any variation)
- "quick zap" or "quick" as casual intensifier
- "Wow" / "Amazing" / "impressive turnaround"
- "turns out", "shows up", "lines up" (casual markers)
- "tough spots" or other informal labels
- Sentence fragments (e.g., "Impressive.", "Worth noting.")
- Any exclamations or enthusiasm markers

REQUIRED TECHNICAL STYLE:
- Use standard technical verbs: removes, restores, improves, reduces, exposes, reveals, demonstrates, maintains, achieves
- Front-load main action in sentences for directness
- Use em-dash for emphasis or specification when needed
- Focus on observable facts with professional detachment
- Natural measurement integration without ceremonial language

CRITICAL FORMATTING:
- Separate paragraphs with ONE blank line
- Each paragraph: 1-3 sentences ONLY
- End sentences with periods
- NO labels (no "Before:", "After:", etc.)
- NO extra commentary

OUTPUT ONLY: The two caption paragraphs, nothing else.
