# Further Modified AI Detection Patterns Configuration

# Format: pattern_type|regex_pattern|severity|example|reason
# Further Improvements (November 13, 2025):
# - Added linguistic_dimensions category: Covers morphosyntactic (e.g., dependency over-optimization), psychometric (e.g., low MTLD lexical diversity), and sociolinguistic (e.g., pronoun bias) from 2025 studies like Muñoz-Ortiz et al. and Durak et al.
# - Refined patterns: Added LLM phrases like "testament to", "in the ever-evolving landscape"; integrated low emotional variance (e.g., uniform sentiment words).
# - Bias reduction: Added exclusions for non-native patterns (e.g., article flexibility); new low_hedges threshold normalized by length.
# - Enhanced repetition: Added n-gram entropy thresholds (script to compute); increased burstiness tolerance to stdev<3.5 for short texts.
# - Weights: Further shifted to linguistic_dimensions (15%) for depth; total 100%.
# - Thresholds: Calibrated lower (ai_detection=60) based on AAAI 2025 benchmarks; added text_length factor (e.g., adjust scores for <100 words).
# - Recommendations: Added bias_check for non-native flags; suggest hybrid ML for semantics (e.g., perplexity API call if borderline).
