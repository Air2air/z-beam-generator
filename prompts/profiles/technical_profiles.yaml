  # CAPTION: Visual comparison narrative
  caption:
    name: "Visual Comparison"
    purpose: "Describe before/after surface appearance at microscale"
    
    technical_approach:
      minimal: |
        Describe what you see visually. Use plain everyday language.
        NO technical specifications or measurements.
        Focus on observable surface characteristics only.
      
      moderate: |
        Balance visual description with context.
        Include 1-2 key measurements if they help clarify the difference.
        Use accessible technical terms when needed.
      
      detailed: |
        Provide comprehensive technical context with visual description.
        Include relevant measurements and specifications where appropriate.
        Use precise technical terminology naturally.
    
    measurement_handling:
      guideline: "Only include measurements that enhance understanding of the visual comparison"
      examples:
        - "Surface roughness changes from Ra 3.2μm to 0.8μm"
        - "Contaminant layer thickness reduced from 50μm to surface-clean"
    
    specification_depth:
      minimal: "NO specs - pure visual description"
      moderate: "1-2 key specs if clarifying"
      detailed: "Multiple specs as contextually relevant"

  # SUBTITLE: Single-sentence hook
  subtitle:
    name: "Hook Statement"
    purpose: "Single compelling sentence about laser cleaning benefit"
    
    technical_approach:
      minimal: |
        Focus on the practical benefit in everyday language.
        NO technical specifications or jargon.
        Make it accessible and clear.
      
      moderate: |
        Balance benefit with light technical context.
        May reference one key technical advantage if relevant.
        Keep accessible while showing expertise.
      
      detailed: |
        Include technical precision in the benefit statement.
        Reference specific technical advantages naturally.
        Demonstrate deep technical understanding.
    
    measurement_handling:
      guideline: "Rarely include measurements - focus on benefit statement"
      examples:
        - "Removes oxidation while maintaining base material integrity"
        - "Achieves surface cleanliness without thermal distortion"
    
    specification_depth:
      minimal: "NO specs - pure benefit"
      moderate: "At most one technical reference"
      detailed: "May include technical precision"

  # FAQ: Question-answer technical explanation
  faq:
    name: "Technical Q&A"
    purpose: "Answer common technical questions about laser cleaning"
    
    technical_approach:
      minimal: |
        Provide clear, accessible answers in plain language.
        Minimize technical jargon and specifications.
        Focus on practical understanding.
      
      moderate: |
        Balance accessibility with technical accuracy.
        Include key specifications where they answer the question.
        Use technical terms with context.
      
      detailed: |
        Provide comprehensive technical explanations.
        Include relevant specifications and parameters.
        Use precise technical terminology appropriately.
    
    measurement_handling:
      guideline: "Include measurements when they directly answer the question"
      examples:
        - "Q: How deep can it clean? A: Typically removes 10-100μm of contamination"
        - "Q: Is it safe for thin coatings? A: Yes, with fluence control under damage threshold"
    
    specification_depth:
      minimal: "Specs only if essential to answer"
      moderate: "Include specs that clarify the answer"
      detailed: "Comprehensive specs as relevant"

  # DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive material overview
  description:
    name: "Material Overview"
    purpose: "Comprehensive explanation of material and laser cleaning approach"
    
    technical_approach:
      minimal: |
        Explain the material and cleaning process in accessible terms.
        Minimize technical specifications and jargon.
        Focus on practical understanding and applications.
      
      moderate: |
        Balance comprehensive coverage with accessibility.
        Include key specifications and technical context.
        Use technical terms naturally with explanations.
      
      detailed: |
        Provide thorough technical coverage of material and process.
        Include relevant specifications, parameters, and technical details.
        Use precise technical terminology throughout.
    
    measurement_handling:
      guideline: "Include measurements that characterize material properties and cleaning parameters"
      examples:
        - "Thermal conductivity of 237 W/m·K allows rapid heat dissipation"
        - "Typical fluence range 0.5-2 J/cm² for oxide removal"
    
    specification_depth:
      minimal: "Specs only for key material characteristics"
      moderate: "Multiple specs across material and process"
      detailed: "Comprehensive technical specifications"

# CALCULATION LOGIC (from DynamicConfig.calculate_technical_intensity()):
#
# If jargon_removal > 0.7:
#     Use "minimal" approach
# Elif technical_intensity < 0.3:
#     Use "minimal" approach  
# Elif technical_intensity < 0.7:
#     Use "moderate" approach
# Else:
#     Use "detailed" approach
#
# Example injection into template:
#   {technical_guidance} → profiles.caption.technical_approach.moderate

# INTEGRATION POINTS:
# 1. PromptBuilder._get_technical_guidance() reads this file
# 2. Calculates intensity level from enrichment_params
# 3. Retrieves appropriate text from profiles[component_type].technical_approach[level]
# 4. Injects as {technical_guidance} placeholder in component template

# TESTING:
# Run: pytest tests/test_technical_profiles.py -v
