# SECTION: Applications
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, contaminant-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific contaminant's application contexts
- Distinguishes from similar contaminants' usage patterns
- Uses descriptive language (e.g., "Oil Film Industrial Uses", "Rust Protective Applications")
- Avoids generic terms like "Applications" or "Uses"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what application contexts this section covers
- Highlight why these applications create specific contamination patterns
- Set context for industrial and environmental presence

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive contaminant applications content including:

### Source Industries
- Primary industries generating this contaminant
- Specific processes producing contamination
- Volume and frequency of generation
- Geographic concentration patterns

### Contamination Pathways
- How contaminant reaches target materials
- Transport and deposition mechanisms
- Environmental factors affecting spread
- Cross-contamination potential

### Application-Specific Behavior
- Performance characteristics in different contexts
- Interaction with host materials
- Persistence and removal difficulty
- Environmental stability factors

### Management Approaches
- Industry-specific control strategies
- Regulatory requirements and compliance
- Best practices for contamination prevention
- Cleanup and remediation methods

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "sectionTitle": "[Contaminant-specific application title]",
  "sectionDescription": "[1-2 sentences about contamination sources and pathways]",
  "sectionContent": "[Detailed contamination analysis with sources, pathways, behavior, and management]"
