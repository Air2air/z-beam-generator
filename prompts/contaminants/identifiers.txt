## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what identification systems this section covers
- Highlight why these identifiers are specifically important for THIS contaminant
- Set context for industry classification and documentation

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive contaminant identifiers content including:

### Classification Systems
- Industry standard contamination categories
- ASTM and ISO classification codes
- Regulatory identification numbers
- Environmental contamination classifications

### Naming Conventions
- Scientific and technical nomenclature
- Industry-specific terminology and jargon
- Regional and international naming variations
- Historical naming evolution and context

### Detection Identifiers
- Visual identification characteristics
- Chemical analysis markers and signatures
- Instrumentation-based identification methods
- Field identification protocols and guidelines

### Documentation Standards
- Reporting and record-keeping requirements
- Quality assurance identification protocols
- Cross-reference systems and databases
- Verification and authentication methods
