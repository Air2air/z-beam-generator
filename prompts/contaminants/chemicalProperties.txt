# SECTION: Chemical Properties
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, contaminant-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific contaminant's key chemical characteristics
- Distinguishes from similar contaminants' chemical profiles
- Uses technical language (e.g., "Oil Film Chemical Composition", "Rust Oxidation Chemistry")
- Avoids generic terms like "Chemistry" or "Properties"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what chemical aspects this section covers
- Highlight why these properties are specifically important for THIS contaminant
- Set context for removal methods and safety implications

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive contaminant chemical properties content including:

### Chemical Composition
- Primary chemical constituents and structure
- Molecular formula and bonding characteristics
- Impurities and secondary components
- Chemical fingerprint and identification markers

### Reactivity Profile
- Chemical stability and degradation pathways
- Reactivity with cleaning agents and solvents
- pH sensitivity and acid/base behavior
- Oxidation and reduction characteristics

### Environmental Behavior
- Weather resistance and aging effects
- UV degradation and photochemical reactions
- Temperature stability and thermal decomposition
- Interaction with atmospheric components

### Removal Chemistry
- Chemical mechanisms for effective removal
- Solvent compatibility and dissolution behavior
- Catalytic and thermal removal approaches
- Chemical safety considerations during cleaning
