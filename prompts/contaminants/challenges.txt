# SECTION: Challenges
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, contaminant-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific contaminant's primary challenge areas
- Distinguishes from similar contaminants' difficulties
- Uses descriptive language (e.g., "Oil Film Removal Challenges", "Rust Adhesion Issues")
- Avoids generic terms like "Challenges" or "Problems"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what challenge categories this section addresses
- Highlight why these challenges are specifically problematic for THIS contaminant
- Set context for removal and management difficulties

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive contaminant challenges content including:

### Removal Difficulties
- Adhesion strength and bonding characteristics
- Chemical resistance to cleaning agents
- Physical removal barriers and complications
- Layer thickness and penetration challenges

### Detection Challenges
- Visual identification complications
- Instrumentation and analysis difficulties
- Hidden or embedded contamination
- Differentiation from similar contaminants

### Environmental Factors
- Temperature and humidity effects
- Aging and weathering impacts
- Chemical interaction with substrates
- Cross-contamination potential

### Management Solutions
- Proven removal strategies and techniques
- Specialized equipment and tools required
- Process optimization and efficiency improvements
- Quality control and verification methods
