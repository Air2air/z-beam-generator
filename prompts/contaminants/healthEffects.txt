# SECTION: Health Effects
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, contaminant-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific contaminant's health impact profile
- Distinguishes from similar contaminants' health effects
- Uses descriptive language (e.g., "Lead Paint Exposure Risks", "Asbestos Inhalation Hazards")
- Avoids generic terms like "Health Effects" or "Toxicity"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what health risks this section addresses
- Highlight why these effects are specifically concerning for THIS contaminant
- Set context for exposure scenarios and vulnerable populations

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive contaminant health effects content including:

### Exposure Pathways
- Primary routes of human exposure
- Contamination transfer mechanisms
- Environmental persistence and bioavailability
- Cumulative exposure potential

### Health Impact Profiles
- Acute health effects and symptoms
- Chronic health consequences
- Target organ systems and mechanisms
- Dose-response relationships

### Vulnerable Populations
- High-risk demographic groups
- Occupational exposure scenarios
- Residential and community risks
- Sensitive life stages (pregnancy, childhood)

### Protection Strategies
- Personal protective equipment recommendations
- Exposure reduction techniques
- Medical monitoring protocols
- Emergency response for acute exposure

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "sectionTitle": "[Contaminant-specific health title]",
  "sectionDescription": "[1-2 sentences about health risks and exposure context]",
  "sectionContent": "[Detailed health analysis with pathways, impacts, vulnerable groups, and protection]"
