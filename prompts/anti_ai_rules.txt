CRITICAL - AVOID AI PATTERNS:
- No formulaic structures (e.g., "X does Y while preserving Z")
- No abstract transitions ("results suggest", "data indicate")
- Vary opening words and sentence patterns
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Add specific details and concrete examples
- Use natural, conversational flow
