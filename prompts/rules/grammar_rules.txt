# Grammar and Style Rules (Generic - Apply to All Voices)

## Sentence Length Variation (MANDATORY)

STRICT ENFORCEMENT - Every paragraph MUST include:
- At least 1 short sentence (5-10 words)
- At least 1 medium sentence (12-20 words)
- At least 1 long sentence (25+ words)

DISTRIBUTION RULES:
- NO consecutive sentences within ±3 words of each other
- Target span: 15+ words from shortest to longest sentence
- Natural flow: Don't force length for its own sake, but ensure variety

LENGTH CALCULATION:
- Count all words including articles, prepositions, conjunctions
- Hyphenated terms count as one word (e.g., "high-powered" = 1 word)
- Numbers and units count as separate words (e.g., "100 W" = 2 words)

## Sentence Structure Variation

REQUIRED MIX (per paragraph):
- At least 1 simple sentence (one independent clause)
- At least 1 compound or complex sentence (multiple clauses)
- Vary sentence starters (first 2-3 words must differ between sentences)

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
- Starting consecutive sentences with the same word
- Parallel structure across multiple sentences (breaks natural flow)
- Repetitive clause patterns (e.g., all sentences using subordinate clauses)

## Punctuation Standards

AMERICAN ENGLISH STANDARD:
- Serial comma (Oxford comma) required: "a, b, and c"
- Em dash for emphasis or interruption: "—" (not hyphen "-")
- Period-ending sentences (default)
- Avoid excessive semicolons (max 1 per paragraph)

## Spelling Standards

AMERICAN ENGLISH:
- -ize endings: "optimize", "analyze", "realize"
- -or endings: "color", "favor", "behavior"
- Single "l": "traveling", "labeled", "modeling"
- -er endings: "center", "meter", "fiber"

## Active vs Passive Voice

BALANCE:
- Target: 70-80% active voice
- Passive acceptable when:
  * Subject is unknown or unimportant
  * Emphasizing the action's recipient
  * Scientific objectivity required
- Avoid passive for simple actions with clear actors

## Technical Writing Standards

MEASUREMENTS (when appropriate for technical content):
- Include units with numerical values only when technical detail is required
- Use standard SI units or common industry standards when precision matters
- For plain language content: use qualitative descriptions instead of units
- Approximate when natural: "around 2.7", "roughly 100"

CLARITY:
- One main idea per sentence (complex ideas need multiple sentences)
- Front-load important information
- Use concrete nouns and verbs over abstractions

## Natural Language Patterns

CONVERSATIONAL ELEMENTS:
- Occasional conjunctions at sentence start: "But", "And", "Yet"
- Contractions allowed in informal contexts
- Transitional phrases: "though", "however", "meanwhile"

RHYTHM:
- Alternate short and long sentences for natural pacing
- Use fragments sparingly for emphasis (1 per 5 sentences max)
- Vary clause positioning (beginning, middle, end)
