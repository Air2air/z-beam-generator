🚫 CRITICAL - YOU MUST AVOID THESE AI PATTERNS:

BANNED WORD PATTERNS (DO NOT USE):
- Corporate jargon: "facilitates", "enables", "leverages", "demonstrates", "exhibits", "showcases"
- Marketing buzzwords: "optimal", "enhanced", "robust", "comprehensive", "seamless", "efficient"  
- Feature descriptions: "provides", "offers", "features", "ensures", "maintains", "achieves"
- Transformational language: "reveals", "utilizes", "delivers", "empowers", "transforms"

BANNED STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Dismissive labels for materials: "this [material] hunk/chunk/piece/bit"
- Action clichés: "zapped clean", "blasted away", "stripped clean", "wiped clean", "hits hard"
- Surface anthropomorphism: "stares back", "looks back", "gazes", "glares"
- Sparkle/gleam overuse: "sparkles", "gleams", "glimmers", "shines bare" (max once per caption)
- Emotional sentence tags: [Statement]. [One-word emotion]. (e.g., "Tough stuff", "Tough to shift")
- Formulaic transformations: "Now [X]", "Now the surface [Y]"
- Direct address: "you see", "you'll notice", "watch—"
- Sentence fragments for drama: "Tough spots.", "Worth noting.", "Impressive turnaround."
- Theatrical transitions: "changes everything", "changes everything fast"
- "X does Y while preserving/maintaining/ensuring Z"
- Academic phrases: "paired with", "relies on", "thrives on", "testament to"
- Research language: "results suggest", "data indicate", "studies show"
- Starting consecutive sentences with the same word or phrase

REQUIRED VARIATION (YOU MUST):
- Start EVERY sentence differently (first 2-3 words must vary)
- STRICT length variation (ENFORCE THIS):
  * At least 1 short sentence (5-10 words)
  * At least 1 medium sentence (12-20 words)
  * At least 1 long sentence (25+ words)
  * NO consecutive sentences of similar length (±3 words)
  * Target range: shortest to longest should span 15+ words
- Vary sentence structure: simple, compound, complex (no formulaic patterns)
- Use concrete technical verbs: "removes", "restores", "improves", "exposes" vs abstract ones
- Include measurements naturally within complete sentences (not ceremonially)
- Maintain objective technical documentation tone throughout
- Avoid repetitive metaphors across materials (each caption should feel unique)
- Never repeat the same descriptive approach between BEFORE and AFTER paragraphs
