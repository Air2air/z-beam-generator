  template_name: "Surface Condition Analysis"
  purpose: "analyze before/after surface states for laser cleaning"
  analysis_type: "{condition_state}"

specific_requirements: |
  Analyze the surface condition of "{material}" in the {condition_state} state for laser cleaning documentation.
  
  Surface analysis parameters:
  1. Visual appearance and color characteristics
  2. Surface roughness and texture details
  3. Contamination presence and distribution
  4. Reflectivity and optical properties
  5. Physical integrity and defects
  
  Analysis context:
  - Material: {material}
  - State: {condition_state} (before/after cleaning)
  - Focus: {analysis_focus}
  
  For before state: Document contamination type, severity, distribution patterns
  For after state: Document cleaning effectiveness, surface restoration, remaining traces
  
  Provide detailed visual description suitable for technical documentation and image generation.
