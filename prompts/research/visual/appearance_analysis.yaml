  template_name: "Contamination Appearance Analysis"
  purpose: "analyze visual characteristics of contaminated surfaces"
  analysis_depth: "detailed"

specific_requirements: |
  Analyze the visual appearance of "{contaminant}" contamination on "{material}" surfaces.
  
  Provide detailed visual characteristics:
  1. Color changes: Describe hue, saturation, brightness variations
  2. Texture modifications: Surface roughness, smoothness, patterns
  3. Physical distribution: How contamination spreads across surface
  4. Optical properties: Reflectivity, transparency, opacity changes
  5. Thickness indicators: Visual cues about contamination depth
  
  Focus on observable characteristics that help identify contamination severity and laser cleaning requirements.
  Use precise descriptive language for accurate image generation prompts.
