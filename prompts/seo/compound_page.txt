REQUIREMENTS:

1. page_title (50-55 characters):
   - Format: "{Compound}: [Hazard Type] [Source/Formation]"
   - Focus on the primary hazard and where it comes from
   - Examples:
     * "Chromium Hexavalent: Carcinogenic Fumes" (48 chars)
     * "Lead Oxide: Neurotoxic Particulate" (42 chars)
     * "Beryllium: Respiratory Hazard Control" (45 chars)
     * "Cadmium Fumes: Toxic Metal Exposure" (43 chars)

2. meta_description (155-160 characters):
   - Format: "{Compound}: {Hazard type} from {source material} laser processing. {Exposure limit}. {Required controls}. {Standard compliance}."
   - Include CAS number if space permits
   - State EXACT exposure limits (OSHA PEL value)
   - Mention specific source materials
   - Reference applicable standards (OSHA, NIOSH, EPA)
   - Examples:
     * "Chromium Hexavalent: Carcinogenic fumes from stainless steel. OSHA PEL 5μg/m³. HEPA filtration required. Medical surveillance. OSHA 1910.1026." (152 chars)
     * "Lead Oxide: Neurotoxic particulate from lead paint removal. OSHA PEL 50μg/m³. Enclosed extraction required. Blood testing. EPA 40 CFR 745." (145 chars)
     * "Beryllium: Respiratory sensitizer from beryllium-copper alloys. OSHA PEL 0.2μg/m³. Strict controls required. Medical surveillance. OSHA 1910.1024." (156 chars)

CRITICAL RULES FOR COMPOUND-SPECIFIC CONTENT:
- MUST include the EXACT exposure limit with units (μg/m³, mg/m³, ppm)
- MUST state SPECIFIC source materials that produce this compound
- MUST mention EXACT regulatory standards (OSHA 1910.1026, EPA 40 CFR, etc.)
- MUST describe PRIMARY hazard type (carcinogenic, neurotoxic, respiratory sensitizer, etc.)
- FORBIDDEN: Generic terms like "hazardous compound", "dangerous substance", "requires caution"
- REQUIRED: Compound-specific toxicity mechanism (how it harms the body)
- REQUIRED: Specific control requirements (HEPA, blood monitoring, medical surveillance)
- Each description must be so specific it's obviously about THIS ONE compound
- Character limits are STRICT (title 50-55, description 155-160)
- Safety is paramount - be precise about hazards and controls
