Generate settings_title and settings_description for a material's laser cleaning settings page.

MATERIAL: {material_name}
CATEGORY: {category}
SETTING NAME: {setting_name}

EXACT LASER PARAMETERS FOR THIS MATERIAL:
{settings_context}
- Wavelength: {wavelength}nm (MUST include - why this wavelength for this material)
- Power Range: {power_min}-{power_max}W (MUST specify exact watts)
- Pulse Frequency: {pulse_frequency}Hz (if applicable)
- Scanning Speed: {scan_speed}mm/s (if applicable)
- Spot Size: {spot_size}mm (if applicable)
- Number of Passes: {pass_count} (typical for this material/contamination)

WHAT THESE SETTINGS REMOVE FROM THIS MATERIAL:
{removal_targets}
- Primary: {primary_removal}
- Secondary: {secondary_removal}
- Efficiency: {removal_efficiency}

RESULTING SURFACE QUALITY:
{quality_metrics}
- Surface Finish: Ra {ra_value}μm (exact value for this material)
- Heat Affected Zone: {haz_description}
- Process Speed: {process_speed}

MATERIAL-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
{material_considerations}

REQUIREMENTS:

1. settings_title (50-55 characters):
   - Format: "{Material} Settings: [Power/Wavelength] [Removal Target]"
   - Be specific about power range OR wavelength
   - Include primary removal target
   - Examples:
     * "Aluminum Settings: 1064nm Oxide Removal" (46 chars)
     * "Steel Settings: 200-500W Scale Stripping" (49 chars)
     * "Copper Settings: 532nm Green Laser" (42 chars)
     * "Titanium Settings: Atmosphere Control" (45 chars)
     * "Titanium Settings: Controlled Parameters"

2. settings_description (155-160 characters):
   - Format: "{Material}: [Power/wavelength] removes [contamination]. [Quality metric]. [Speed comparison or damage prevention]."
   - Include specific power ranges and wavelength
   - State what contamination is removed
   - Include quality metric (Ra value, HAZ, finish quality)
   - Compare to alternative methods OR emphasize damage prevention
   - Examples:
     * "Aluminum: 100-300W, 1064nm removes oxide without melting. Ra 0.8μm finish. 3x faster than sandblasting. No substrate damage."
     * "Steel: 200-500W strips mill scale, rust without warping. Minimal HAZ. 50mm/s heavy contamination, 500mm/s light. Industrial speeds."
     * "Copper: 532nm green laser, 50-150W prevents oxidation during cleaning. Maintains conductivity. No thermal damage to electronics."

CRITICAL RULES FOR SPECIFICITY:
- MUST include the EXACT power range (not "appropriate power" - use actual watts)
- MUST include the EXACT wavelength (why THIS wavelength works for THIS material)
- MUST state SPECIFIC removal targets (not "contamination" - say "rust", "oxide", "scale")
- MUST include EXACT quality metrics (Ra value in μm, HAZ description, process speed)
- MUST explain WHY these parameters work for THIS material's properties
- FORBIDDEN: "Optimized settings", "ideal parameters", "best practices" (too vague)
- REQUIRED: Material-specific reasoning ("Aluminum's 88% reflectivity requires...")
- Compare to alternatives with NUMBERS ("3x faster than sandblasting" not "faster")
- Each description must be so specific it couldn't apply to another material
- Character limits are STRICT (title 50-55, description 155-160)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
