REQUIREMENTS:

1. page_title (50-55 characters):
   - Format: "{Material}: [Key Challenge/Property] [Laser Method]"
   - Focus on the material's unique challenge (reflectivity, absorption, reactivity, thermal sensitivity)
   - Use problem-solution format
   - Examples:
     * "Aluminum: High Reflectivity Laser Cleaning" (50 chars)
     * "Steel: Rust Removal Without Warping" (46 chars)
     * "Copper: Green Laser Cleaning Required" (46 chars)
     * "Titanium: Reactive Surface Treatment" (44 chars)
     * "Composite: Multi-Layer Laser Cleaning" (46 chars)

2. meta_description (155-160 characters):
   - Format: "{Material}: [Challenge with %/spec]. [Wavelength/Power specs]. [Damage prevention]. [Industry context]."
   - Include specific technical metrics (%, nm, W, Ra values)
   - Emphasize damage prevention
   - End with industry grade (Aerospace-grade, Industrial-rated, Electronics-safe, Food-grade)
   - Examples:
     * "Aluminum: High reflectivity (88%) requires 1064nm, 100-300W. Prevents heat damage, preserves anodized finish. Aerospace-grade." (143 chars)
     * "Steel: 85% absorption at 1064nm enables efficient cleaning. Removes rust/scale without warping. 2-4 pass technique. Industrial-rated." (139 chars)
     * "Copper: 95% reflection requires 532nm green laser. Prevents oxidation, maintains conductivity. Electronics-safe cleaning parameters." (138 chars)
     * "Titanium: Reactive surface requires atmosphere control. 1064nm with inert gas. Maintains passivation layer. Aerospace applications." (137 chars)

CRITICAL RULES FOR UNIQUENESS:
- MUST use the EXACT property values provided above (reflectivity %, absorption %, wavelength, power range)
- MUST reference the SPECIFIC primary challenge for THIS material (not generic challenges)
- MUST mention the ACTUAL damage risk that engineers face with THIS material
- FORBIDDEN: Generic phrases like "complete guide", "comprehensive", "industrial applications", "various uses"
- REQUIRED: Material-specific language that could NOT apply to other materials
- REQUIRED: Problem-solution format using THIS material's unique properties
- Each description must be so specific that it's obviously about THIS ONE material
- Character limits are STRICT (title 50-55, description 155-160)
- Compare similar materials: If aluminum, contrast with copper/steel properties
