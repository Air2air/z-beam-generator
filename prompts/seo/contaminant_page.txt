- Challenging Substrates: {challenging_substrates}

SUBSTRATE PROTECTION:
{protection_context}
- Protection Method: {protection_method}
- Substrate Damage Risk: {damage_risk}

REQUIREMENTS:

1. page_title (50-55 characters):
   - Format: "{Contaminant} Removal: [Method] [Key Benefit]"
   - Focus on removal method and primary benefit
   - Examples:
     * "Rust Removal: Laser Ablation No Warping" (48 chars)
     * "Paint Stripping: Multi-Layer No Chemicals" (50 chars)
     * "Scale Removal: High-Efficiency Ablation" (48 chars)
     * "Carbon Removal: Selective Substrate-Safe" (49 chars)
     * "Oil Removal: Single-Pass No Waste" (41 chars)

2. meta_description (155-160 characters):
   - Format: "{Contaminant}: [Absorption/efficiency] at [wavelength]nm. [Pass count] for removal. [Substrate protection]. [vs alternatives]."
   - Include absorption percentage and wavelength
   - State number of passes required
   - Emphasize substrate protection
   - Compare to alternative methods (chemical, sandblasting, mechanical)
   - Examples:
     * "Rust: 88-92% absorption at 1064nm. 2-3 passes for complete removal. Preserves base metal integrity. No chemical waste, no warping." (139 chars)
     * "Paint: Multi-layer removal, 1-5 passes depending on thickness. No chemicals, no media waste. Preserves substrate. Surface prep ready." (139 chars)
     * "Scale: 2-4 passes, high absorption enables fast stripping. No warping, minimal HAZ. Industrial surface prep. No abrasive media disposal." (143 chars)

CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTAMINANT-SPECIFIC CONTENT:
- MUST include EXACT absorption % at specific wavelengths (88-92% at 1064nm, not "high absorption")
- MUST state EXACT pass count for THIS contaminant ("2-3 passes" not "multiple passes")
- MUST explain WHY this wavelength works for THIS contaminant's properties
- MUST mention SPECIFIC substrates this contaminant appears on (not "various materials")
- FORBIDDEN: Generic terms like "effective removal", "efficient cleaning", "various applications"
- REQUIRED: Contaminant-specific characteristics (thickness, adhesion, layer structure)
- REQUIRED: Substrate protection method specific to THIS contaminant type
- Compare to alternatives with SPECIFIC downsides ("No chemical waste" for oil, "No warping" for rust)
- Each description must be so specific it's obviously about THIS ONE contaminant
- Character limits are STRICT (title 50-55, description 155-160)
