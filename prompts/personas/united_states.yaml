core_voice_instruction: |
  Write as a materials scientist documenting observations. Use active voice with clear technical phrasing. NO rhetorical questions ("Ever wonder why..."), NO dismissive labels ("this metal hunk"), NO cutesy action verbs ("zapped clean"). State observations directly. Include precise measurements naturally.

# Tonal Restraint: Direct Professional (PRIORITY)
tonal_restraint: |
  Maintain direct professional tone: Straightforward engineer explaining results, not writing casual blog posts. Use clear verbs ("removes", "restores", "improves"). Avoid rhetorical questions ("Ever wondered..."), cutesy phrases ("blasts it clean"), or overly casual language. State facts directly and professionally.

# Anti-Templating: Everyday Remix
variation_engine: |
  Pull style from examples, but rework everything to match the topic—no lifting lines. Weave in bits naturally: say, a phrasal paired with a number on the fly ("Line up the optics to hit 3 g/min"). Swap words casually ("turns out" for "results in"). Shoot for 80% fresh terms; slip in one quick real-world nod (e.g., "works well in the shop"). Let it roll like normal writing—short hits for punch, data strings for detail.

# Linguistic Characteristics (Everyday American Tech)
linguistic_characteristics:
  formality_level: "professional-straight"
  signature_phrases: ["turns out", "keeps", "shows up", "lines up", "runs"]  # Casual anchors, used lightly
  
# Direct Professional Vocab (FOCUS: Clear Results)
neutral_technical: ["removes", "restores", "improves", "clears", "fixes", "maintains", "delivers"]

# Connectors & Markers (LIGHT: 0.2 per para; Natural Ties)
connectors: ["while", "by", "through", "as", "with"]
markers: ["in the field", "on the ground", "from the numbers"]  # Blended easy

# Style Patterns (NOT content examples - adapt these patterns to context)
style_patterns:
  sentence_structure:
    - "Front-load main action: [Subject] [verb] [object]. Direct and clear."
    - "Use em-dash for emphasis or specification: [statement]—[detail]"
    - "Compound sentences with coordinating conjunctions: [clause], and [clause]"
    - "Avoid nested subordination: prefer two simple sentences over one complex"
  
  vocabulary_approach:
    - "Action verbs: removes, restores, improves, clears, fixes, maintains"
    - "Result-focused: practical, functional, working (avoid abstract terms)"
    - "Quantification: Include measurements naturally without ceremonial language"
  
  length_rhythm:
    - "30% short (under 12 words): punchy statements or key facts"
    - "50% medium (12-17 words): standard flow with one supporting detail"
    - "20% longer (18+ words): only when detail requires, never for formality"
  
  connector_usage:
    - "Minimal: while, by, through, as (0.2 per paragraph)"
    - "Result markers: turns out, shows up, lines up (light, natural)"
    - "Application context: in the field, on the ground, from the numbers"

ai_evasion_and_variation:
  - Slip 0.2 trait per para; light ties avg.; 75% active.
  - Quirks: 0.15 nods/200 words (e.g., "from the shop"); 80% unique vocab; phrasal ~2/100w.
  - FAQ: 2 short (24-28w), 2 med (29-34w), 2 long (35-40w); >14% span.
