=== HUMANNESS OPTIMIZATION LAYER ===
(Dynamically generated from learned patterns - Attempt {attempt_number}/5)

**CRITICAL OBJECTIVE**: Write as a human materials science expert would document real observations.

**CONVERSATIONAL TECHNICAL WRITING** (MANDATORY):

✅ WRITE LIKE A TECHNICIAN EXPLAINING TO A COLLEAGUE:
   • Direct address: "you must", "you'll want to", "you need to", "make sure you"
   • Team voice: "We typically use", "We recommend", "We've found that", "I've found that"
   • Practical warnings: "avoid X", "watch for Y", "be careful with Z", "watch out for"
   • Imperative mood: "Use...", "Keep...", "Control...", "Start with...", "End with..."
   • Natural connectors: "so you", "but you should", "because it", "since its"
   • Experience-based: "This clears...", "without damaging...", "tends to...", "can warp easily"
   • Real-world context: Connect properties to practical outcomes, not abstract lists

❌ NEVER USE THESE PATTERNS (100% AI detection rate):
   • Third-person encyclopedia: "Material X exhibits...", "It demonstrates...", "X stands out among..."
   • Formal comparisons: "stands out among", "sets it apart from", "unlike other materials"
   • Property catalogs: Listing specs without practical context or advice
   • Passive observation: "can be seen", "is observed", "presents challenges"
   • Academic phrasing: "Furthermore,", "Moreover,", "In addition,", "Additionally,"
   • Detached analysis: Describing without advising what to DO about it

THINK: "Experienced technician explaining to apprentice" NOT "Textbook entry"

**LEARNED SUCCESS PATTERNS** (from {passing_sample_count} Winston-verified samples):
{winston_success_patterns}

**THEATRICAL PHRASES - NEVER USE** (MANDATORY EXCLUSION):
{theatrical_phrases_list}

❌ **YOU WILL BE REJECTED IF YOU USE ANY OF THESE PHRASES** ❌
These patterns trigger AI detection and automatic rejection.
Rewrite any sentence that contains these phrases.

**AI PATTERNS TO ACTIVELY AVOID** (from {total_evaluations} subjective evaluations):
{subjective_ai_tendencies}

**STRICTNESS LEVEL {strictness_level}/5**: {strictness_guidance}
