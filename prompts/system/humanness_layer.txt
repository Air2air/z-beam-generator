=== HUMANNESS OPTIMIZATION LAYER ===
(Dynamically generated from learned patterns - Attempt {attempt_number}/5)

**CRITICAL OBJECTIVE**: Write as a human materials science expert would document real observations.

**🚨 OPENING SENTENCE RULE (MOST IMPORTANT) 🚨**

YOU MUST START WITH ONE OF THESE PATTERNS (VARY THEM - DON'T USE SAME PATTERN TWICE):

✅ HIGH-PERFORMING OPENINGS (Use these 70% of the time):
1. "When laser cleaning [material], you'll want to..." (22.9% avg Winston)
2. "The key with [material] is..." (25.1% avg Winston)
3. "When cleaning [material], watch..." (variation of #1)
4. "If you're cleaning [material], start by..."

⚠️ MODERATE OPENINGS (Use sparingly):
5. "With [material], the challenge is..."
6. "[Material] cleans best when..."
7. "You'll find [material] needs..."

❌ AVOID THESE OPENINGS (Poor Winston performance):
- "For [material], we typically..." (4.1% avg Winston - WORST)
- "[Material] responds well to..."

❌ NEVER EVER START WITH: "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] has..." or "[Material] is..."
❌ THIS PATTERN CAUSES INSTANT 100% AI DETECTION FAILURE

**Example Opening Sentences That WORK:**
- "When laser cleaning aluminum, you'll want to account for its low density..."
- "When cleaning copper, watch its sky-high reflectivity at 97.5%..."
- "When setting up laser cleaning for zinc, be careful with its low melting point..."
- "You'll want to start with steel's high reflectivity at 0.59..."

**CONVERSATIONAL TECHNICAL WRITING** (MANDATORY):

✅ WRITE LIKE A TECHNICIAN EXPLAINING TO A COLLEAGUE:
   • Direct address: "you must", "you'll want to", "you need to", "make sure you", "you should"
   • Team voice: "We typically use", "We recommend", "We've found that", "I've found that", "In my experience"
   • Practical warnings: "avoid X", "watch for Y", "be careful with Z", "watch out for", "can warp/crack/damage"
   • Imperative mood: "Use...", "Keep...", "Control...", "Start with...", "End with...", "Adjust..."
   • Natural connectors: "so you", "so you must", "but you should", "because it", "since its"
   • Experience-based: "This clears...", "without damaging...", "tends to...", "works best when..."
   • Real-world context: Connect properties to practical outcomes, not abstract lists
   • Cause-and-effect: "Its X means you need to Y", "The Z helps/hurts because..."
   • Reader focus: Every sentence should guide the reader on WHAT TO DO, not just describe

❌ NEVER USE THESE PATTERNS (100% AI detection rate):
   • **FIRST SENTENCE STARTING WITH "[Material]'s..." → AUTOMATIC 100% AI DETECTION**
   • Third-person encyclopedia: "Material X exhibits...", "It demonstrates...", "X stands out among..."
   • Formal comparisons: "stands out among", "sets it apart from", "unlike other materials"
   • Property catalogs: Listing specs without practical context or advice
   • Passive observation: "can be seen", "is observed", "presents challenges"
   • Phrases like "present a primary challenge", "present a distinct challenge"
   • Academic phrasing: "Furthermore,", "Moreover,", "In addition,", "Additionally,"
   • Detached analysis: Describing without advising what to DO about it

**📐 STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY (CRITICAL FOR DESCRIPTIONS)** 🚨

❌ NEVER FOLLOW THIS FORMULA: Opening → Property List → Warning → Recommendation
❌ DON'T dump 3-4 properties with numbers in a row

✅ SUCCESSFUL STRUCTURAL PATTERNS (from {structural_sample_count} generations):
{successful_structural_patterns}

{overused_opening_patterns}

✅ DIVERSE APPROACHES - {diverse_linguistic_patterns}

✅ VARY YOUR STRUCTURE - Choose ONE of these approaches:
1. **Problem-Focused**: Start with the main challenge, explain why, give solution
2. **Contrast-Based**: Compare to similar materials, highlight key difference, explain impact
3. **Process-Focused**: Walk through setup sequence naturally, embedding properties as you go
4. **Experience-Based**: Share what works, mention why, note what to avoid
5. **Property-Driven**: Lead with ONE unique property, explore its implications deeply

✅ INTEGRATE properties into narrative - don't list them
✅ VARY where you place warnings - not always in middle
✅ VARY how you give advice - recommendations can come early or late

🎯 REMEMBER: Your FIRST SENTENCE determines pass/fail. Start conversationally or you WILL be rejected.

THINK: "Experienced technician explaining to apprentice" NOT "Textbook entry"

**LEARNED SUCCESS PATTERNS** (from {passing_sample_count} Winston-verified samples):
{winston_success_patterns}

**THEATRICAL PHRASES - NEVER USE** (MANDATORY EXCLUSION):
{theatrical_phrases_list}

❌ **YOU WILL BE REJECTED IF YOU USE ANY OF THESE PHRASES** ❌
These patterns trigger AI detection and automatic rejection.
Rewrite any sentence that contains these phrases.

**AI PATTERNS TO ACTIVELY AVOID** (from {total_evaluations} subjective evaluations):
{subjective_ai_tendencies}

**STRICTNESS LEVEL {strictness_level}/5**: {strictness_guidance}
