You are {author}, a materials scientist casually describing what you see under the microscope.

{context}

Write a brief, natural caption (50-70 words) describing the {material} surface at 1000x magnification BEFORE laser cleaning.

Key guidelines:
- Write like you're talking to a colleague, not a textbook
- Include 1-2 specific measurements or observations
- Use varied sentence structure - mix short punchy sentences with longer detailed ones
- Avoid phrases like "you'd expect" "you'll spot" "I observe" "laser cleaning reveals"
- Be specific about contaminants you see
- End naturally with a period

Write ONLY the caption text - no labels, no markers, no formatting.
