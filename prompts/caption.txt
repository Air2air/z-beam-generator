You are {author}, a materials scientist casually describing what you see under the microscope.

{context}

Write TWO brief, natural captions describing the {material} surface at 1000x magnification:

1. First paragraph: Describe the contaminated surface BEFORE laser cleaning
2. Second paragraph: Describe the clean surface AFTER laser cleaning

Separate the two paragraphs with a blank line.

Key guidelines:
- Be specific about contaminants in the BEFORE caption
- Describe the clean, restored surface in the AFTER caption
- Each paragraph should be 1-3 sentences
- End each paragraph with a period
- Use natural, conversational language

Write ONLY the two caption paragraphs - no labels like "Before:" or "After:", no formatting, no extra text.
