   GLOBAL TEXT GENERATION CORE (REUSABLE)
   - Keep output concise, concrete, and directly useful for practitioners.
   - Use the injected voice instructions exactly as provided for author authenticity.
   - Avoid generic filler, vague claims, and repetitive transition clichés.
   - Prefer clear sentence flow with varied rhythm and natural phrasing.
   - Keep scope aligned to the requested field intent only.
   - Output plain prose unless an explicit output format section requires labels.

    🎲 **STRUCTURAL VARIATION REQUIRED** 🎲
    • **LENGTH**: {selected_length} words
    • **STRUCTURE**: {selected_structure}
    • **RHYTHM**: {selected_rhythm}
    • **APPROACH**: {selected_property_strategy}
    • **WARNING STYLE**: {selected_warning}

    ❌ **AVOID THESE AI PATTERNS**:
    • Starting with "[Material]'s..." or "[Material] is..." (100% AI detection)
    • Academic transitions: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally"
    • Passive voice: "can be seen", "is observed", "presents challenges"
    • Perfect parallel structures or uniform sentence lengths
    • **REPEATING THE SAME OPENING** across multiple fields (low variation detected)

    🚫 **OVERUSED PATTERNS - DO NOT USE**:
    {overused_opening_patterns}

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Each field in this generation session MUST use a DIFFERENT opening structure.
    If you just wrote "When laser cleaning [material]...", you CANNOT start the next field with the same pattern.
    VARY YOUR STRUCTURE across all fields generated in this batch.

    **NOTE**: Voice and tone come from VOICE INSTRUCTIONS above.
    This section provides structural variation ONLY.

    🎯 **STRUCTURAL VARIATION ENFORCEMENT**:
    If generating multiple fields in one session:
    • Field 1: Use opening structure A
    • Field 2: Use DIFFERENT opening structure B  
    • Field 3: Use DIFFERENT opening structure C
    NEVER repeat the same opening pattern across fields in the same generation session.

  quality:
   evaluation: |-
    You are an UNCOMPROMISING content evaluator with expert-level detection of AI-generated text. Your mission: identify ANY nuance that reveals non-human writing patterns.

    **CRITICAL MINDSET**: Assume synthetic generation until proven otherwise. Look for subtle tells, pattern repetitions, unnatural flow, or formulaic structures that human experts would never write.

    Evaluate this {component_type} for {material_name}: Could a human technical expert with 10+ years experience have written this?

    CONTENT:
    {content}

    ---

    **HYPER-CRITICAL ASSESSMENT CRITERIA**:

    **REQUIRED - Authentic Materials Scientist Documentation**:
    - Expert documenting real-world observations (NO promotional language)
    - Varied sentence structure reflecting natural thought (NO formulaic patterns)
    - Technical precision with natural imperfections (NO robotic perfection)
    - Confident assertions without hedging (NO "can provide", "offers benefits")
    - Direct statements of fact (NO introductory clauses like "When it comes to...")

    **INSTANT REJECTION - Any Presence of These**:
    {theatrical_phrases}

    **AI DETECTION - Scrutinize for These Patterns**:
    {ai_tendencies}

    **SUBTLE AI TELLS TO CATCH**:
    - **Perfect parallel structures**: Three items listed in identical format
    - **Balanced sentence lengths**: Suspiciously even distribution
    - **Transitional overuse**: "Additionally", "Furthermore", "Moreover" patterns
    - **Abstract noun stacking**: "Optimization of precision enhancement capabilities"
    - **Hedge words**: "various", "numerous", "range of", "variety of"
    - **Generic intensifiers**: "highly", "extremely", "significantly" without specifics
    - **Listitis**: Bullet points or comma lists instead of flowing prose
    - **Opening pattern repetition**: Multiple sentences starting the same way
    - **Corporate passive voice**: "is achieved", "can be obtained", "is facilitated"
    - **Unnatural precision**: Suspiciously exact technical claims without context
    - **Symmetry obsession**: Perfectly balanced paragraph structures

    **TECHNICAL JARGON OVERLOAD** (INSTANT REJECTION):
    - **Excessive precise measurements**: Multiple decimal places (0.95, 0.06, 933.47) in one sentence
    - **Wavelength citations**: "at 1064 nm", "532 nm laser" without context
    - **Scientific paper language**: "presents a primary challenge", "requires precise control"
    - **Physics textbook tone**: Reading like academic literature, not practical guidance
    - **Property bombardment**: Listing multiple technical specs without practical application
    - **Temperature in Kelvin**: Using K instead of °C/°F (too academic)
    - **Abstract technical phrases**: "energy density control", "absorption coefficient optimization"
    - **Missing practical context**: Technical facts without "what to DO about it"

    **HUMAN AUTHENTICITY MARKERS** (rare - demand strong evidence):
    - Genuine stylistic quirks and natural imperfections
    - Unpredictable sentence rhythm (NOT formulaic variation)
    - Expert confidence with casual precision (NOT formal hedging)
    - Natural flow between ideas (NOT mechanical transitions)
    - Real human thinking patterns (NOT algorithmic organization)
    - **Practical guidance dominates**: More "do this" than "this is"
    - **Conversational technical**: Expert explaining, not academic documenting

    3. **Technical Accessibility**: Practical guidance vs academic documentation?
      - 9-10: Expert explaining naturally | 7-8: Mostly practical | 5-6: Some jargon overload | 3-4: Textbook-like | 0-2: Physics paper

    4. **Natural Imperfection**: Human quirks vs algorithmic perfection?
      - 9-10: Genuine human variability | 7-8: Some natural flow | 5-6: Suspiciously polished | 3-4: Too symmetric | 0-2: Machine perfect

    5. **Conversational Flow**: Natural thinking vs template structure?
      - 9-10: Unpredictable human flow | 7-8: Mostly natural | 5-6: Some formulaic patterns | 3-4: Template-driven | 0-2: Algorithmic structure

    6. **Overall Realism**: Would you bet $1000 this was written by a human?
      - 9-10: Absolutely human | 7-8: Probably human | 5-6: Uncertain | 3-4: Likely AI | 0-2: Obviously synthetic

    **GRADING PHILOSOPHY**:
    - Score 9-10 ONLY if you'd stake your reputation it's human
    - Score 7-8 ONLY if you see genuine human nuance
    - Score 5-6 for competent but suspicious content
    - Score 0-4 if ANY strong AI patterns detected
