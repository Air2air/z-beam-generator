# SECTION: Physical Properties
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, material-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific material's key physical characteristics
- Distinguishes from similar materials' physical profiles
- Uses technical language (e.g., "Steel Mechanical Properties", "Aluminum Thermal Characteristics")
- Avoids generic terms like "Physical" or "Properties"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what physical aspects this section covers
- Highlight why these properties are specifically critical for THIS material
- Set context for handling, processing, and performance implications

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive physical properties content including:

### State and Structure
- Physical state under normal conditions
- Crystal structure and phase characteristics
- Molecular organization and bonding
- Polymorphic forms and variations

### Thermal Properties
- Melting and boiling points
- Thermal conductivity and expansion
- Heat capacity and thermal stability
- Phase transition temperatures and behavior

### Mechanical Properties
- Density and specific gravity
- Hardness and strength characteristics
- Elasticity and deformation behavior
- Fracture and fatigue properties

### Handling Requirements
- Storage condition requirements
- Transportation and safety considerations
- Equipment compatibility and materials
- Environmental sensitivity and protection needs

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "sectionTitle": "[Material-specific physical title]",
  "sectionDescription": "[1-2 sentences about physical characteristics and significance]",
  "sectionContent": "[Detailed physical analysis with state, thermal, mechanical, and handling requirements]"
