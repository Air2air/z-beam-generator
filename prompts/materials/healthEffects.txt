# SECTION: Health Effects
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, material-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific material's health impact focus
- Distinguishes from similar materials in toxicity profile
- Uses descriptive language (e.g., "Aluminum Inhalation Risks", "Steel Dermal Effects")
- Avoids generic terms like "Health Effects" or "Toxicity"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what health effects this section covers
- Highlight why these effects are specifically important for THIS material
- Set context for exposure scenarios and risk assessment

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive health effects content including:

### Risk Assessment Matrix
- Exposure levels (low, moderate, high)
- Routes of exposure (inhalation, dermal, ingestion, injection)
- Severity ratings for each exposure combination
- Time-to-effect relationships

### Target Organ Systems
- Primary affected organs and systems
- Mechanism of action specific to THIS material
- Dose-response relationships and thresholds
- Bioaccumulation and elimination patterns

### Health Impact Timeline
- Acute effects (immediate, <24 hours)
- Short-term effects (24 hours - 2 weeks)
- Chronic effects (>2 weeks, long-term)
- Carcinogenic or mutagenic potential

### Safety Recommendations
- Personal protective equipment requirements
- Exposure limits and monitoring protocols
- Medical surveillance recommendations
- Emergency response procedures for overexposure
