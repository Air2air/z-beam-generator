# SECTION: Chemical Properties
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, material-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific material's key chemical characteristics
- Distinguishes from similar materials' chemical profiles
- Uses technical language (e.g., "Steel Alloy Composition", "Aluminum Reactivity Profile")
- Avoids generic terms like "Chemistry" or "Properties"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what chemical aspects this section covers
- Highlight why these properties are specifically critical for THIS material
- Set context for performance and safety implications

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive chemical properties content including:

### Composition Analysis
- Primary chemical composition and structure
- Elemental percentages and ratios
- Molecular structure characteristics
- Purity levels and common impurities

### Reactivity Profile
- Chemical stability under normal conditions
- Reactivity with common substances
- Corrosion resistance characteristics
- pH sensitivity and behavior

### Transformation Behavior
- Phase changes and transition temperatures
- Chemical degradation pathways
- Oxidation and reduction potential
- Catalytic properties and interactions

### Safety Considerations
- Hazardous reaction potentials
- Incompatible materials and substances
- Storage and handling chemical requirements
- Emergency chemical response protocols

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "sectionTitle": "[Material-specific chemical title]",
  "sectionDescription": "[1-2 sentences about chemical characteristics and significance]",
  "sectionContent": "[Detailed chemical analysis with composition, reactivity, transformations, and safety]"
