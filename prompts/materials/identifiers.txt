# SECTION: Identifiers
# PURPOSE: Generate complete section with title, description, and content

## 1. SECTION TITLE GENERATION
Generate a concise, material-specific title (3-7 words) that:
- Identifies THIS specific material's identification system
- Distinguishes from similar materials' naming patterns
- Uses systematic language (e.g., "Steel Classification Codes", "Aluminum Grade Standards")
- Avoids generic terms like "Identifiers" or "Names"

## 2. SECTION DESCRIPTION GENERATION
Generate 1-2 sentences that:
- Explain what identification systems this section covers
- Highlight why these identifiers are specifically important for THIS material
- Set context for industry usage and standardization

## 3. SECTION CONTENT GENERATION
Generate comprehensive identifiers content including:

### Primary Identification Systems
- CAS numbers and regulatory identifiers
- IUPAC nomenclature and chemical names
- Industry standard designations and codes
- Trade names and commercial identifiers

### Classification Standards
- International standard organizations (ISO, ASTM, EN)
- Industry-specific classification systems
- Grade designations and quality standards
- Regional and national standard variations

### Naming Conventions
- Historical naming evolution and context
- Context-specific usage patterns
- Common abbreviations and acronyms
- Cross-reference relationships between systems

### Usage Guidelines
- When to use specific identifier types
- Industry and application context requirements
- Documentation and specification standards
- Quality and authenticity verification methods

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "sectionTitle": "[Material-specific identifier title]",
  "sectionDescription": "[1-2 sentences about identification systems and importance]",
  "sectionContent": "[Detailed identifier analysis with systems, standards, conventions, and guidelines]"
