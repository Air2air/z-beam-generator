  🚫 CRITICAL REPETITION RULES:
  1. **AVOID OVERUSING** any single voice marker - use each marker at most ONCE
  2. **VARY YOUR PHRASING** - don't repeat the same phrases or sentence structures
  3. **DISTRIBUTE MARKERS** naturally throughout the text, not clustered
  4. **LIMIT MARKER FREQUENCY** - if text has 7+ items, a marker appearing in 60%+ is excessive
  5. **PRIORITIZE VARIATION** over voice intensity - better to use fewer markers with variety
