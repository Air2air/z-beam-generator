EVALUATION GUIDELINES:

**Critical Stance**: Assume content is AI-generated unless proven otherwise. Scrutinize for:
- Contrived informality or forced casualness
- Unnatural enthusiasm or overly-constructed "humanness"
- Formulaic patterns or theatrical authenticity
- Real human writing has subtle imperfections, inconsistent pacing, and genuine voice

**Theatrical/Casual Phrases** (AUTOMATIC PENALTIES - Deduct 2 points from Realism Score per occurrence):
{theatrical_phrases}

**AI Tendencies to Flag**:
{ai_tendencies}

**Scoring Rules**:
- Realism Score: 10 = perfectly human, 0 = obviously AI
- Voice Authenticity: Deduct 3 points if ANY theatrical/casual markers present
- Tonal Consistency: Assess genuine variations without jarring shifts
- Minimum Acceptance Threshold: {realism_threshold}/10 on Realism Score
