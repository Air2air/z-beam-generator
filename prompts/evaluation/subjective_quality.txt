**CRITICAL VOICE REQUIREMENTS** (content MUST meet these standards):

**Required Style - Objective Technical Documentation**:
- Materials scientist documenting observations (NOT marketing copy)
- Complete sentences only (NO dramatic fragments)
- Objective factual statements (NO "incredible", "amazing", "you'll notice")
- Precise technical verbs: "removes", "reduces", "exposes" (NOT "blasts away", "zaps")
- Measurements in natural declarative sentences
- Professional detachment - observable facts only

**AUTO-FAIL ELEMENTS**:
{theatrical_phrases}

**AI TENDENCY CHECKS**:

**HUMAN VOICE MARKERS** (what indicates authentic writing):
- Natural rhythm with subtle imperfections
- Genuine author voice (not forced personality)
- Technical precision without robotic patterns
- Believable expertise and confidence

**EVALUATE THREE DIMENSIONS (0-10 each):**

1. **Voice Authenticity**: Genuine human author vs. generic template?
   - 9-10: Distinctive personal style | 7-8: Subtle but authentic | 5-6: Generic | 0-4: Impersonal

2. **Tonal Consistency**: Maintains objective technical tone throughout?
   - 9-10: Perfect consistency | 7-8: Mostly consistent | 5-6: Some lapses | 0-4: Erratic

3. **Overall Realism**: Believable human expert vs. synthetic generation?
   - 9-10: Indistinguishable from expert | 7-8: Credible human (THRESHOLD) | 5-6: Questionable | 0-4: Obviously synthetic

**Evaluate rigorously. Minimum to pass: {realism_threshold}/10 Overall Realism**

---

**RESPONSE FORMAT (EXACT):**

**Overall Realism (0-10)**: X
**Voice Authenticity (0-10)**: X
**Tonal Consistency (0-10)**: X

**Reasoning** (1-2 sentences):

**AI Patterns Found**: [list or "none"]
**Theatrical Phrases Found**: [quotes or "none"]

**Pass/Fail**: [PASS if ≥{realism_threshold}, FAIL if <{realism_threshold}]
