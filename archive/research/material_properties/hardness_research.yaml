      REASONING: Phenolic resin composites exhibit a wide range of hardness values
      (80-120 HRM) depending on the specific formulation, filler type (e.g., wood
      flour, mineral, fabric), and processing conditions. The value of 100 HRM represents
      a typical, median value for general-purpose molded phenolic composites. The
      provided value of 85.0 HRM falls at the very low end of this established range
      and is more characteristic of a specific, softer formulation.

      REASONING: The provided value of 343 HV is consistent with the typical hardness
      range for commercially pure, annealed tantalum. The hardness of tantalum is
      highly dependent on its purity and thermomechanical processing (e.g., cold work).
      The ASM Handbook lists a typical hardness for annealed tantalum as 70-125 HB
      (approximately 75-130 HV), but for harder, cold-worked conditions, values can
      exceed 300 HV. The CRC Handbook and other sources confirm that heavily cold-worked
      tantalum can achieve hardness values in the range of 340-400 HV, making 343
      HV a scientifically accurate and plausible value for a specific, non-annealed
      condition.

    ai_reasoning: Porphyry is not a single mineral but an igneous rock with a porphyritic
      texture, meaning it has larger crystals (phenocrysts) in a finer-grained groundmass.
      Its hardness is determined by its mineral composition. The primary phenocrysts
      in porphyry are typically feldspars (Mohs 6-6.5) and quartz (Mohs 7). The aggregate
      hardness of the rock is a composite of these minerals and is generally reported
      as being slightly less than quartz due to the presence of the softer feldspars.
      Authoritative geological references consistently list the hardness of porphyry
      and similar quartz-feldspathic rocks like granite and rhyolite at approximately

      REASONING: Porphyry is not a single mineral but an igneous rock with a porphyritic
      texture, meaning it has larger crystals (phenocrysts) in a finer-grained groundmass.
      Its hardness is determined by its mineral composition. The primary phenocrysts
      in porphyry are typically feldspars (Mohs 6-6.5) and quartz (Mohs 7). The aggregate
      hardness of the rock is a composite of these minerals and is generally reported
      as being slightly less than quartz due to the presence of the softer feldspars.

    ai_response: "Based on a review of authoritative materials science sources, the\
      \ provided value for the hardness of ash wood is not scientifically accurate.\n\
      \n**1. Research Findings:**\nHardness for wood is most accurately and commonly\
      \ measured using the Janka hardness test, which measures the force required\
      \ to embed a 0.444-inch steel ball to half its diameter into the wood. The result\
      \ is expressed in units of force (pounds-force, lbf, or Newtons, N), not pressure\
      \ (MPa). The provided value of 1320 MPa is a unit of pressure (Pascal) and is\
      \ inconsistent with standard wood hardness reporting.\n\nAuthoritative references\
      \ provide Janka hardness values for various ash species.\n\n**2. Authoritative\
      \ References:**\n*   **The Wood Database:** A highly respected, scientifically-grounded\
      \ resource for wood properties, lists the Janka hardness for White Ash (*Fraxinus\
      \ americana*) as 1,320 lbf. This number matches the magnitude of the provided\
      \ value but is in the correct unit for this test.\n*   **USDA Forest Service,\
      \ Forest Products Laboratory:** The *Wood Handbook\u2014Wood as an Engineering\
      \ Material* is a primary reference. It lists the Janka hardness for White Ash\
      \ as 5,900 N, which is equivalent to approximately 1,326 lbf.\n\n**3. Comparison\
      \ with Current Value:**\nThe current value of \"1320.0 MPa\" appears to be a\
      \ misinterpretation where the correct unit of \"lbf\" (pounds-force) for the\
      \ Janka hardness test was incorrectly replaced with \"MPa\" (Megapascals). These\
      \ units are not directly convertible in this context, as one is a force and\
      \ the other is a pressure. The numerical value of 1320 is, however, consistent\
      \ with the standard Janka hardness rating for ash.\n\n**4. Verified Value and\
      \ Confidence:**\nSince the property \"hardness\" for wood is defined by the\
      \ Janka test, the verified value must be reported in the standard unit.\n\n\
      VERIFIED_VALUE: 1320 lbf\nCONFIDENCE: 98\nREFERENCES: The Wood Database (White\
