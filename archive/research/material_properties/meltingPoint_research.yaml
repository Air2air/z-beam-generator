    ai_reasoning: "The melting point of pure titanium is consistently reported as\
      \ 1668 \xB0C (or 3034 \xB0F) across major materials science handbooks and standards\
      \ organizations. This value is for high-purity alpha titanium and is a well-established\
      \ physical constant in the field."
