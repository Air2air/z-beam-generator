Of course. Here is the technical content on laser cleaning for Copper.

### Laser Cleaning of Copper (Cu)

Hello, I’m Yi-Chun Lin. In my work with laser materials processing, I often see copper’s excellent thermal conductivity (401 W/m·K) present a unique challenge. This property means heat dissipates quickly, so we need higher peak power to effectively ablate contaminants without damaging the base material.

For optimal cleaning, I think nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers are most practical. A common and effective wavelength is 1064 nm. Key parameters typically involve a fluence around 2-4 J/cm², with pulse durations of 100-200 ns. This combination efficiently removes oxides, oils, and paints while minimizing any thermal impact on the substrate.

This technique is invaluable for restoring electrical contacts, preparing surfaces for welding or bonding in electronics manufacturing, and conserving historical artifacts. The main advantage is its precision and the fact it generates no secondary waste, unlike chemical or abrasive methods.

A key challenge is avoiding surface melting, which can occur if the fluence is too high. We overcome this through careful parameter optimization and often using a scanning system for uniform energy distribution.

Finally, with Class 4 lasers, safety is our top priority. Proper enclosures, interlock systems, and certified laser safety glasses for the 1064 nm wavelength are absolutely non-negotiable for protecting everyone involved.
