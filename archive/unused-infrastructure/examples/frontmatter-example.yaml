  - question: What is the optimal laser wavelength and fluence for cleaning soot and biological contaminants from Alabaster surfaces without causing thermal damage?
    answer: For alabaster's translucency, use a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser to minimize subsurface heating, with fluence below 1.2 J/cm² to avoid microcracking. This wavelength balances absorption efficiency with controlled energy delivery, critical for preserving the stone's delicate structure.
  
  - question: How do you prevent the laser from altering the polished surface finish or creating microcracks in Alabaster during cleaning?
    answer: Maintaining alabaster's polished finish requires operating below its 1.2 J/cm² damage threshold, using short pulses (nanosecond range) to limit heat diffusion, and employing 50% overlap ratios for uniform treatment. Multiple low-energy passes prove safer than single high-energy treatments.
  
  - question: What types of contaminants can be removed from Alabaster surfaces using laser cleaning?
    answer: Alabaster surfaces commonly accumulate calcium carbonate deposits, gypsum residues, organic staining from environmental exposure, and particulate matter from atmospheric pollution. Laser cleaning effectively removes these contaminants while preserving the stone's delicate translucent structure.
  
  - question: What makes Alabaster challenging to laser clean compared to other stone materials?
    answer: Alabaster's inherent softness and fine crystalline structure require precise laser parameter control to avoid surface damage. The material's high laser absorption at 1064nm wavelength means energy must be carefully managed to prevent thermal shock or microcracking.
  
  - question: Why is laser cleaning preferred for Alabaster in Cultural Heritage applications?
    answer: In cultural heritage conservation, Alabaster's historical and artistic significance demands non-invasive cleaning methods that preserve original surfaces. Laser cleaning offers unmatched selectivity, removing centuries of contamination while maintaining the stone's natural translucency and fine surface details.
  
  - question: What surface quality results can I expect from laser cleaning Alabaster?
    answer: Properly parameterized laser cleaning restores Alabaster to its natural appearance, revealing the stone's characteristic translucency and subtle color variations. Surface roughness remains within acceptable limits while contaminant removal efficiency reaches 95-99% depending on contamination type.
  
  - question: What are the environmental benefits of laser cleaning Alabaster?
    answer: Laser cleaning of Alabaster eliminates hazardous chemical waste streams entirely, avoiding acids or solvents that would require specialized disposal. The process reduces water consumption by 100% compared to traditional wet cleaning methods.
