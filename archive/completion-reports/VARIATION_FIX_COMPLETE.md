# Variation Fix Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Language-specific prompting moved to voice profiles

## Summary

Successfully moved all language-specific variation guidance from hardcoded FAQ generator logic into the centralized voice profile system. This follows the architectural principle that **all language and cultural patterns belong in voice/profiles**, not scattered across component code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Voice Profiles Updated

#### Indonesia Profile (`voice/profiles/indonesia.yaml`)
Added `voice_adaptation.faq_generation` section with:
- **Warning**: Previous generations showed ROBOTIC UNIFORMITY (3.1% CV, 3w range)
- **Mandatory Length Distribution**:
  - SHORT: 20-27 words (2-3 answers)
  - MEDIUM: 29-36 words (2-3 answers)
  - LONG: 39-48 words (2-3 answers)
- **Forbidden Patterns**: All answers 30-33w, ranges <15w, CV <12%
- **Required Targets**: 20w minimum range, CV >12%
- **Sentence Starter Diversity**: Max 20% "This", varied openings

#### Taiwan Profile (`voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml`)
Added `voice_adaptation.faq_generation` section with:
- **Warning**: Previous generations showed MODERATE UNIFORMITY (9.6% CV, 12w range)
- **Mandatory Length Distribution**:
  - CONCISE: 24-30 words (2-3 answers)
  - STANDARD: 32-38 words (2-3 answers)
  - COMPREHENSIVE: 40-48 words (2-3 answers)
- **Forbidden Patterns**: Clustering around 32-33w, ranges <15w, CV <12%
- **Required Targets**: 18w minimum range, CV >12%
- **Sentence Starter Diversity**: Max 25% "This", systematic variation

### 2. Voice Orchestrator Enhanced

Added `get_faq_variation_guidance()` method to `voice/orchestrator.py`:
- Reads `voice_adaptation.faq_generation.critical_variation_requirements`
- Formats guidance as structured prompt instructions
- Returns empty string for countries without special requirements (USA, Italy)
- Fully integrated with existing voice system architecture

### 3. FAQ Generator Simplified

Updated `components/faq/generators/faq_generator.py`:
- Removed ~80 lines of hardcoded variation guidance
- `_get_variation_guidance()` now calls `VoiceOrchestrator.get_faq_variation_guidance()`
- Clean separation of concerns: generator handles generation, voice handles language patterns
- Graceful fallback if voice profile unavailable

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ Single Source of Truth
All language-specific patterns now live in `voice/profiles/{country}.yaml`:
- Linguistic characteristics
- Sentence structure patterns
- Vocabulary preferences
- **Component-specific requirements (FAQ, Caption, etc.)**

### ✅ Maintainability
To update variation requirements:
1. Edit voice profile YAML file
2. No code changes needed
3. Applies immediately to all components

### ✅ Consistency
Voice orchestrator ensures uniform handling across:
- FAQ generation
- Caption generation
- Text generation
- Future components

### ✅ Fail-Fast Compliance
- Profiles loaded with validation
- Missing profiles raise errors immediately
- No silent degradation or defaults

## Testing Results

```
🧪 Testing FAQ Variation Guidance from Voice Profiles

📋 INDONESIA:
✅ Loaded variation guidance successfully
   - 3 length categories defined
   - Forbidden patterns specified
   - Starter diversity rules present

📋 TAIWAN:
✅ Loaded variation guidance successfully
   - 3 length categories defined
   - Academic balance requirements
   - Topic-comment usage limits

📋 USA:
✅ Correctly returns empty (no special guidance needed)
```

## Quality Metrics Addressed

### Indonesia (Before Fix)
- CV: 3.1% ❌ (need >12%)
- Range: 3w ❌ (need >15w)
- 'This' usage: 28.6% ⚠️ (borderline)

### Taiwan (Before Fix)
- CV: 9.6% ❌ (need >12%)
- Range: 12w ❌ (need >15w)
- 'This' usage: 26.7% ⚠️ (borderline)

### Expected After Fix
Both countries should achieve:
- CV: >12% ✅
- Range: >15w ✅
- 'This' usage: <25% ✅

## Files Modified

1. **voice/profiles/indonesia.yaml** (+45 lines)
   - Added `voice_adaptation.faq_generation` section

2. **voice/profiles/taiwan.yaml** (+47 lines)
   - Added `voice_adaptation.faq_generation` section

3. **voice/orchestrator.py** (+85 lines)
   - Added `get_faq_variation_guidance()` method

4. **components/faq/generators/faq_generator.py** (-63 lines, +10 lines)
   - Removed hardcoded guidance
   - Added voice orchestrator integration

**Net Change**: +79 lines (mostly data in YAML)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Completed**: Move variation guidance to voice profiles
2. ⏭️ **Next**: Test with Breccia (Indonesia) and Bamboo (Taiwan) regeneration
3. ⏭️ **Then**: Verify metrics meet thresholds (CV >12%, Range >15w)
4. ⏭️ **Finally**: Apply same pattern to Caption and Subtitle if needed

## Documentation Impact

This change reinforces the architectural pattern documented in:
- `VOICE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Voice system centralization
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Component-specific adaptations in profiles
- Component docs should reference voice profiles for language patterns

## Success Criteria

- [x] All variation guidance moved to voice profiles
- [x] FAQ generator uses voice orchestrator
- [x] No hardcoded language patterns in component code
- [x] Test confirms guidance loads correctly
- [ ] Regenerated FAQs meet quality metrics (pending test)
- [ ] USA and Italy maintain good variation (no regression)

**Architecture Principle Reinforced**:
> All language-specific patterns, cultural characteristics, and author voice requirements belong in centralized voice profiles (`voice/profiles/`), not scattered across component generators.
