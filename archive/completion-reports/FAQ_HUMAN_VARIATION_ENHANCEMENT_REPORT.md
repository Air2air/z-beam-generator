### Priority 2: Reduce Question Repetition (High) 🟡

**Problem**: 36.2% of questions use top 5 formulaic starters

**Solutions**:

#### Diversify "What are the..." (140 uses → target <50)
```
Instead of: "What are the optimal parameters..."
Alternatives:
- "Which parameters work best..."
- "How should I configure..."
- "What parameter settings deliver..."
- "Which values optimize..."
- "What configuration ensures..."
```

#### Diversify "Can laser cleaning..." (130 uses → target <50)
```
Instead of: "Can laser cleaning remove..."
Alternatives:
- "Is it possible to remove..."
- "Will laser cleaning eliminate..."
- "Does this method effectively remove..."
- "How well does laser cleaning handle..."
- "Is laser treatment suitable for removing..."
```

#### Diversify "How does..." (75 uses → target <30)
```
Instead of: "How does the laser..."
Alternatives:
- "What mechanism allows..."
- "By what process does..."
- "Through what means does..."
- "What enables the laser to..."
- "In what way does..."
```

---

### Priority 3: Vary Technical Phrase Presentation (High) 🟡

**Problem**: Same technical parameters repeated verbatim 95+ times

**Solutions**:

#### Wavelength Variations (95 uses of "a 1064 nm wavelength")
```
Instead of always: "a 1064 nm wavelength"
Rotate through:
- "1064 nm wavelength" (no article)
- "1.064 μm laser light"
- "near-infrared wavelength at 1064 nanometers"
- "1064nm Nd:YAG emission"
- "wavelength of 1064 nm"
- "1.06 micron infrared light"
```

#### Fluence Variations (65 uses of "at 2.5 j/cm² fluence")
```
Instead of always: "at 2.5 J/cm² fluence"
Rotate through:
- "2.5 J/cm² energy density"
- "fluence of 2.5 joules per square centimeter"
- "2.5 J/cm² laser fluence"
- "energy fluence at 2.5 J/cm²"
- "2.5 joules per cm² surface energy"
```

#### Scan Speed Variations (71 uses of "500 mm/s scan speed")
```
Instead of always: "500 mm/s scan speed"
Rotate through:
- "scan velocity of 500 mm/s"
- "500 millimeters per second scanning"
- "0.5 m/s scan rate"
- "scanning at 500 mm/s"
- "500 mm/s traverse speed"
```

---

### Priority 4: Add Conversational Flow (Moderate) 🟢

**Current State**: Answers are technically accurate but often mechanical

**Enhancement Techniques**:

#### Add Transitions
```
❌ Mechanical: "Use 1064 nm. Set fluence to 2.5 J/cm². Scan at 500 mm/s."

✅ Conversational: "For optimal results, start with 1064 nm wavelength. 
Combined with 2.5 J/cm² fluence, this approach ensures effective cleaning. 
Scanning at 500 mm/s completes the parameter set."
```

#### Include Author Perspective
```
❌ Generic: "Laser cleaning removes rust."

✅ With Expertise (Taiwan - Yi-Chun Lin): "In my research on laser surface 
engineering, I've found that systematic rust removal requires precise 
parameter control. The methodology I recommend ensures reproducible results."

✅ With Expertise (USA - Todd Dunning): "Through years optimizing laser 
systems, I've seen this innovative approach deliver breakthrough performance 
in rust removal applications."
```

#### Add Context and Applications
```
❌ Abstract: "This wavelength is effective."

✅ Contextualized: "This wavelength proves particularly effective in 
semiconductor manufacturing cleanrooms, where traditional methods introduce 
contamination risks. Medical device facilities benefit similarly."
```

---

### Priority 5: Enhance Material Specificity (Moderate) 🟢

**Problem**: Answers sometimes feel templated rather than material-specific

**Solutions**:

#### Reference Material Properties
```
❌ Generic: "Use these parameters for cleaning."

✅ Material-Specific (Alabaster): "Given alabaster's translucency and 
calcium carbonate composition, these parameters prevent subsurface heating 
that causes yellowing."

✅ Material-Specific (Aluminum): "Aluminum's high thermal conductivity 
requires rapid pulse delivery to prevent heat diffusion beyond the 
contamination layer."
```

#### Connect to Real Applications
```
❌ Abstract: "This method works well."

✅ Application-Specific: "In aerospace applications, this method removes 
fuel residues from aluminum components without the chemical waste associated 
with solvent cleaning."
```

#### Mention Material-Specific Challenges
```
❌ Generic: "Avoid damage."

✅ Challenge-Specific (Cedar): "Cedar's resinous nature requires careful 
fluence control—too high and you risk igniting volatile compounds, too low 
and soot remains embedded."
```
