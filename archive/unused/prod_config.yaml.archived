# Production Configuration for Z-Beam Generator
# This file contains settings optimized for production use

# Production Environment Settings
TEST_MODE: false

# AI Detection Configuration for Production
AI_DETECTION:
  PROVIDER: "real"  # Use real AI detection service
  ENABLED: true
  TARGET_SCORE: 85.0  # Higher threshold for production
  MAX_ITERATIONS: 5   # More iterations for quality
  TIMEOUT: 120        # Longer timeout for real APIs

# API Configuration for Production
API:
  # Use real API clients
  USE_MOCK_CLIENTS: false
  # Real content generation settings
  MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH: 5000
