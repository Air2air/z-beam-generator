# Test Directory

This directory is for standalone test utilities and debugging scripts.

## Organization

- `/tests/` - Main test suite with structured test modules
- `/test/` - Standalone test utilities and debugging tools (this directory)

## Purpose

This directory can be used for:
- One-off debugging scripts
- Experimental test utilities
- Performance testing tools
- Manual testing scripts
- Temporary debugging files

## Guidelines

- Keep the main test suite in `/tests/`
- Use this directory for utility scripts that don't fit in the main test structure
- Document any utilities you add here
- Clean up temporary files regularly
