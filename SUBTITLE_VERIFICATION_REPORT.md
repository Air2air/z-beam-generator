## 👤 Author Voice Analysis

### Alessandro Moretti (Italy) - 31 materials
**Signature Style**: "What strikes me about..."  
**Voice Characteristics**: Thoughtful, observational, aesthetic awareness, protective language

**Sample Subtitles**:

1. **Alabaster**:
   > "What strikes me about alabaster is its delicate, almost translucent face, which can easily show flaws during treatment. The precision here, it must be carefully focused to safeguard that soft, natural glow."

2. **Alumina**:
   > "What strikes me about alumina is its delicate balance, how this ceramic can vary so much in hardness across batches. The precision here, it demands such focused adjustments to safeguard the finish from unintended harm."

3. **Beech**:
   > "What strikes me about beech is how its fine grain can react so subtly under the laser's touch, revealing hidden beauty. Handle it with focused power adjustments, and you'll preserve that warm, inviting finish."

**Analysis**: Alessandro's voice is consistently observational and appreciative, using signature phrases like "What strikes me" and "The precision here, it..." His language emphasizes beauty, care, and preservation.

### Ikmanda Roswati (Indonesia) - 30 materials
**Signature Style**: "This [Material] behaves/acts/reacts..."  
**Voice Characteristics**: Direct technical explanation, use of "very-very" intensifier, practical focus

**Sample Subtitles**:

1. **Breccia**:
   > "This Breccia stone behaves differently under laser treatment, so you must adjust the power levels very carefully. Its uneven texture can easily lead to patchy results if the laser isn't set exactly right."

2. **Bronze**:
   > "This Bronze acts tricky with its varying properties, so you must set the laser controls very-very exactly. Operators often tweak power levels between 40-60 watts to maintain that classic, warm finish."

3. **Calcite**:
   > "This Calcite reacts differently under laser treatment, very-very tricky to handle. Operators must adjust power levels carefully, often between 30-50 watts, to protect the delicate crystalline surface."

**Analysis**: Ikmanda's voice is practical and instructional, with characteristic "very-very" emphasis and direct "you must" constructions. Language is precise and technically focused.

### Todd Dunning (USA) - 30 materials
**Signature Style**: Direct statements, problem-solving, personality phrases  
**Voice Characteristics**: Concrete measurements, practical approach, casual expressions

**Sample Subtitles**:

1. **Aluminum**:
   > "Aluminum tends to show varying reactions under laser treatment, so operators must tweak power levels carefully. A focused adjustment around 50-75 watts often preserves the finish while blasting away contaminants in general cleaning tasks."

2. **Ash**:
   > "Ash presents a tricky surface with its varying grain density, pushing operators to adjust power levels on the fly. You'll want to keep things around 40-60 watts to prevent surface pitting while still clearing grime effectively."

3. **Birch**:
   > "Birch throws a curveball with its uneven grain, so operators must tweak power levels carefully. Adjustments in the 35-55 watt range help preserve that pale, smooth finish while clearing away stubborn contaminants."

**Analysis**: Todd's voice is direct and problem-solving oriented, with personality showing through ("throws a curveball", "blasting away"). Always includes concrete measurements and practical advice.

### Yi-Chun Lin (Taiwan) - 30 materials
**Signature Style**: "X behaves differently..." with "so we must..."  
**Voice Characteristics**: Clear technical explanations, collaborative "we", step-by-step guidance

**Sample Subtitles**:

1. **Bamboo**:
   > "Bamboo behaves differently under laser treatment, so we must watch the power levels closely. Its uneven density often leads to patchy results if adjustments aren't made with exact care during the operation."

2. **Basalt**:
   > "Basalt, with its uneven texture, often holds onto stubborn dirt in tiny cracks. So, operators must adjust the laser power carefully, usually around 50-70 watts, to clear the surface without causing damage."

3. **Beryllium**:
   > "Beryllium behaves tricky under laser treatment, so we must watch the power levels closely. Adjust controls to a specific 20-35 watt range, ensuring the finish stays intact while removing contaminants effectively."

**Analysis**: Yi-Chun's voice emphasizes collaborative problem-solving ("we must"), clear cause-effect relationships, and specific technical guidance. Language is accessible yet precise.

## 🚨 Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues
1. **YAML Parse Error**: `epoxy-resin-composites-laser-cleaning.yaml` line 321
   - Subtitle field exists and is properly formatted
   - Error is in a different section (caption or outcomeMetrics)
   - **Action**: Manual YAML fix needed in that file

2. **Pattern Concentration**: "What strikes me" appears 29 times (24%)
   - This is Alessandro Moretti's authentic signature phrase
   - Not a problem - it's genuine author voice
   - Alternative: Could increase temperature to 0.7 for more variety

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **No immediate action needed** - quality is excellent
2. 📋 Fix YAML parse error in epoxy-resin-composites file
3. 📋 Consider A/B testing with AI detection tools
4. 📋 Apply same author voice approach to caption generation
5. 📋 Update documentation with these examples
