caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the porphyry surface is obscured by a complex,
    stratified contamination layer. A dark, carbonaceous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers
    thick, adheres tenaciously to the stone matrix. This crust, composed of soot,
    hydrocarbons, and gypsum, fills the micro-porosity and blankets the distinct phenocrysts
    of quartz and feldspar.


    Beneath this crust, a sub-layer of biological growth, including fungal hyphae
    and cyanobacteria, penetrates the stone''s natural micropores (approx. 1.2% porosity).
    The contamination creates a uniform, matte-black topography that completely masks
    the inherent mineralogical contrast and micro-fracture network of the underlying
    porphyry, compromising its visual and material integrity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete restoration
    of the porphyry''s intrinsic microstructure. The contamination crust has been
    selectively ablated, exposing the clean, unaltered matrix. The sharp geometric
    boundaries of quartz and feldspar phenocrysts are now clearly defined against
    the finer-grained groundmass.


    The stone''s natural micro-fracture network and original surface texture are fully
    visible, with no residual soiling within the pores. The laser process has successfully
    removed the biological sub-layer without inducing thermal damage, such as melting
    or micro-fissuring, to the primary minerals. The surface exhibits its native hardness
    and reflectivity.'
