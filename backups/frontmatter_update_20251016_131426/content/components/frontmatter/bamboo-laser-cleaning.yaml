subtitle: Bamboo's fibrous, hollow structure and thin-walled culms differ from dense
  exotic woods. This requires careful adjustment of laser power and scanning patterns
  to avoid burning or damaging the material.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of accumulated
    soot, grime, and degraded organic matter, fills the natural micro-pores and fissures
    of the bamboo structure. The underlying fiber bundles and vascular channels are
    completely masked, presenting a uniformly occluded and texturally flat topography
    with no visible cellular detail.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the intricate, native microstructure of the bamboo. The surface now exhibits clearly
    defined longitudinal fiber bundles with a distinct, aligned grain pattern. Individual
    vascular channels and parenchyma cells are fully exposed, restoring the material's
    characteristic micro-roughness of approximately 8.5 µm Ra. The cleaning process
    has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the primary cellulose
    cell walls, as evidenced by the sharp, well-preserved edges of the fiber structures.
    This results in a surface with restored morphological integrity and no evidence
    of charring or thermal degradation.
