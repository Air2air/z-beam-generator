subtitle: Pine has a soft, porous structure with significant natural resin content.
  This requires careful control of laser power to avoid resin bleeding and prevent
  surface scorching.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the pine surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, microbial biofilm, and particulate matter, fills the porous tracheid structure
    and adheres to the 25 µm surface roughness. The underlying wood grain and earlywood/latewood
    boundaries are partially masked, with contaminants forming a textured, matte-black
    crust that reduces the native reflectivity to below 22%.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored wood microstructure.
    The porous tracheid network is fully exposed, with clear delineation between earlywood
    and latewood bands. The original 25 µm surface roughness is now visible, free
    of embedded contaminants. The surface exhibits a clean, micro-textured profile
    with a reflectivity restored to its intrinsic value.
