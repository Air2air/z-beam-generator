subtitle: MDF lacks a natural grain and is bound by a synthetic resin, unlike other
  engineered woods. This uniform composition requires precise laser settings to avoid
  scorching the surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the MDF surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and organic residues, fills the natural micro-porosity of the substrate.
    The original fibrous texture is masked, creating an uneven, matte topography that
    scatters light and compromises surface energy, which is critical for subsequent
    adhesion processes.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the substrate's intrinsic micro-porous structure. The surface now exhibits a clean,
    open-cell fibrous network with a consistent texture. This precise removal enhances
    surface energy for improved coating adhesion and reveals the uniform, light-absorbing
    qualities of the base MDF material.
