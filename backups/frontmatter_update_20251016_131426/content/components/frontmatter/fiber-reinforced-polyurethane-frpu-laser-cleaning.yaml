subtitle: The composite layers in FRPU can absorb energy differently, so a stable,
  mid-range power setting is your best approach. This prevents the resin from overheating
  while still effectively stripping surface contaminants.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of embedded particulate, hydrocarbon films, and microbial growth, which mask the
    underlying composite structure. The contamination disrupts the intended surface
    texture, filling the micro-valleys between fiber bundles and polyurethane matrix.
    This creates an irregular topography that can interfere with adhesion and surface-sensitive
    processes.
  afterText: Laser cleaning selectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the original FRPU topography. The cleaned surface reveals distinct fiber bundles
    and the polyurethane matrix with minimal substrate alteration. This results in
    a surface free of obscuring films, with its intrinsic micro-texture fully exposed
    for optimal performance.
