subtitle: Concrete surfaces often have a variable composition and porosity. This requires
  careful adjustment of laser settings to effectively remove contaminants without
  damaging the underlying material.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the concrete surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, which fill the natural
    surface pores (approx. 12% porosity). The original texture is masked, and the
    contamination forms a cohesive, low-reflectivity film that significantly reduces
    the substrate's inherent laser absorption properties. The interface between the
    contaminant and the concrete matrix is diffuse, indicating deep penetration into
    the microstructure.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the restored concrete substrate.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation,
    exposing the unaltered cement paste and aggregate. The original surface texture,
    including micro-cracks and pores, is now fully visible and structurally intact.
    The process has not induced melting or glazing, preserving the concrete's compressive
    strength (35 MPa) and porosity. The surface exhibits higher reflectivity, confirming
    the removal of the light-absorbing contaminant film and a return to the substrate's
    baseline optical properties.
