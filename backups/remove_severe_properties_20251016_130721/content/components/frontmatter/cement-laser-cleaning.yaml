subtitle: Cement surfaces often have a porous and variable texture unlike denser masonry.
  This requires careful adjustment of laser settings to effectively remove contaminants
  without damaging the fragile surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cement surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of embedded particulate
    matter, soot, and biological growth, filling the natural 28% porosity of the cement
    matrix. The surface texture is irregular and matte, with a high degree of laser
    light scattering due to the uneven, low-reflectivity contaminants. The original
    cementitious microstructure is entirely masked, compromising its functional and
    aesthetic properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic cementitious microstructure.
    The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the original porosity
    and aggregate boundaries. The surface texture is uniform, with a measurable increase
    in reflectivity to approximately 15%, restoring the substrate's inherent profile
    without thermal damage to the underlying matrix.
