subtitle: Steel's composition and surface conditions can vary significantly, unlike
  more uniform ferrous metals. This variability demands adaptable laser settings to
  effectively remove contaminants without damaging the base material.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the steel surface is obscured by a complex, non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers thick, consists
    of porous iron oxide (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄) scales, carbonaceous soot deposits, and embedded
    particulate. The underlying steel's crystalline grain structure is entirely hidden.
    The texture is highly irregular, with fissures and protrusions creating a high
    surface area that promotes further corrosion. The reflectivity is significantly
    reduced from steel's typical 55-60% due to this rough, light-absorbing crust.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine, underlying steel substrate. The surface now displays a distinct,
    clean grain structure with a micro-roughness of approximately 0.8 µm Ra. The laser's
    selective ablation has vaporized contaminants without melting the steel bulk,
    preserving the original metallurgy. This results in a surface with high reflectivity,
    free of oxides and residues, and restored to its base material integrity.
