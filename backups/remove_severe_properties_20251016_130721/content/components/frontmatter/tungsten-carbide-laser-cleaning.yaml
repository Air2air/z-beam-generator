caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten carbide surface is obscured by a
    complex contamination layer. A carbonaceous soot deposit, approximately 5-10 µm
    thick, forms a discontinuous, amorphous film that masks the underlying substrate's
    fine microstructure. Particulate matter, including embedded metallic oxides and
    unburned hydrocarbons, is randomly distributed across the surface, creating a
    topographically rough and porous texture. This layer significantly alters the
    surface's intrinsic properties, increasing its laser absorption while reducing
    its reflectivity. The contamination fills the natural micro-pores and valleys
    of the sintered ceramic, blurring the distinct boundaries of the hard, hexagonal
    tungsten carbide grains and the cobalt binder phase.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the well-defined, interlocking structure
    of the WC grains and the cobalt matrix. The surface now exhibits its characteristic
    high reflectivity and a clean, micro-rough texture free of obscuring deposits,
    with the original sintered morphology fully visible.
