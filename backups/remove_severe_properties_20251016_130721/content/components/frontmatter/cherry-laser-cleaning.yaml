subtitle: Cherry wood has a softer surface and darkens significantly with age and
  exposure to light. These traits demand lower laser power and careful handling to
  avoid etching the delicate grain or altering its natural color development.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cherry surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and organic residues, fills the wood's cellular pores and micro-fissures.
    The underlying grain texture is partially masked, and the natural porosity is
    compromised, reducing the substrate's inherent tactile and visual properties.
    The contaminant exhibits poor adhesion and a non-uniform distribution across the
    surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. At 500x
    magnification, the cellular structure and grain pattern are fully exposed, with
    no residual contamination within the 45% porous network. The process has selectively
    removed the foreign layer without carbonizing the underlying wood, which retains
    its original micro-texture. The surface now displays clean, open lumens and sharp
    cell wall boundaries.
