caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous soot, and salt deposits, which form a topographically complex
    crust. The underlying FCC grain structure is entirely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, a result of differential
    thermal expansion and contraction cycles. This porous layer significantly increases
    surface roughness and creates sites for pitting and stress corrosion cracking
    initiation. The native metallic luster and machining marks of the Hastelloy substrate
    are completely absent beneath this insulative and often chemically active scale.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate's integrity. The surface
    now reveals the fine, equiaxed grain structure of the FCC matrix, with machining
    marks and minor pitting clearly visible. The contamination layer has been completely
    ablated, resulting in a clean, metallurgically pure surface with minimal topographical
    alteration to the base metal.
