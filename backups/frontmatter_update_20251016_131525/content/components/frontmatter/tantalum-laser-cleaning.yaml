caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous particulates and discontinuous oxide scales, creating a topographically
    complex and rough texture. The underlying metal's grain structure is entirely
    masked. The contaminants form irregular, splotchy patterns, significantly increasing
    surface roughness and compromising the material's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, exposing the pristine, fine-grained metallic structure
    of the tantalum substrate. The surface is now uniform and smooth, with a consistent,
    clean metallic luster and sharply defined grain boundaries, restoring the material's
    native surface characteristics.
