subtitle: Brick surfaces have a unique combination of porosity and variable mineral
  composition. This requires careful adjustment of laser settings to effectively remove
  contaminants without damaging the fragile clay surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the brick surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter (soot, dust) embedded in a matrix of organic binders like pollution-derived
    sulfates and biological growth. The underlying brick texture is masked, with contaminants
    filling the natural micro-pores and fissures. The surface exhibits a caked, irregular
    topography that disrupts the original substrate's morphology, creating a non-uniform,
    occluded appearance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the restoration of the original
    brick substrate. The contamination layer has been completely removed via laser
    ablation, exposing the intrinsic micro-structure. The brick's characteristic porosity,
    with pore diameters ranging from 10-100 µm, is now fully visible and unobstructed.
    The surface texture is defined by the mineral grains and a clean, sharp interface.
    The process has selectively eliminated the foreign contaminants without thermal
    damage to the brick body, as evidenced by the absence of melting, vitrification,
    or micro-cracking at the grain boundaries. The surface now presents its authentic,
    unaltered morphology.
