caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sapphire surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 0.5–2 µm thick. This layer consists of fine
    particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film, likely hydrocarbon-based.
    The contaminants disrupt the substrate's inherent smoothness, creating a textured,
    irregular topography that scatters light and masks the true surface. Isolated
    micro-scratches from prior handling are also visible, filled with this foreign
    material.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the pristine sapphire substrate. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the original surface with a roughness of
    approximately 0.5 nm Ra. The surface is now continuous and uniform, with no residual
    film or particulates. Pre-existing micro-features like scratches are now clean
    and sharply defined, demonstrating the process's selectivity and the material's
    underlying integrity.
