subtitle: Plaster is softer and more porous than other masonry, with a highly variable
  composition. This requires careful calibration of laser settings to prevent surface
  damage and ensure uniform cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the plaster surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter (e.g., soot, dust) embedded in a matrix of organic films, such as lipids
    or hydrocarbons. The underlying plaster's micro-porous structure is filled, and
    its natural crystalline texture is masked. The contaminants form a continuous,
    obscuring film that alters the surface's original reflectance and topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning selectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the original plaster substrate. The micro-porous network, with pore sizes ranging
    from 5-50 µm, is now fully exposed and free of foreign material. The intrinsic
    crystalline structure of the calcium sulfate dihydrate is visible, restoring the
    surface's natural micro-roughness and light reflectance profile. No mechanical
    abrasion or residue from the cleaning process is detectable, confirming the non-contact
    precision of the method.
