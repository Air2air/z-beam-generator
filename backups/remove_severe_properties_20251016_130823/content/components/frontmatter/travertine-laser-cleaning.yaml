caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the travertine surface is obscured by a dense,
    heterogeneous contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer,
    composed of particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, fills
    the stone's characteristic macro-pores and micro-fissures. The underlying calcite
    matrix is largely hidden, with contaminants forming a continuous, textured crust
    that masks the stone's natural granularity and compromises its vapor permeability.
    The surface appears dark and occluded, with the original crystalline structure
    only partially visible in isolated, cleaner pockets.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete restoration of the travertine's
    micro-topography. The contaminant crust has been selectively ablated, exposing
    the intact, interlocking calcite crystals. The stone's inherent porosity is now
    fully open and clearly defined, with no residual deposits within the pore throats.
    The surface texture is restored to its original granular state, with sharp crystal
    boundaries and a uniform, light-toned appearance, confirming the removal of subsurface
    staining without damage to the calcite matrix.
