  description: Microscopic analysis of Cerium surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cerium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The dominant feature is a discontinuous oxide layer, measured with a thickness varying from approximately 5 to 15 micrometers. This layer presents a mottled, grayish appearance with significant topographical variation, creating a visually textured landscape under the microscope. Scattered across this oxide base are numerous, brighter particulate deposits—likely hydrocarbon-based contaminants from handling or environmental exposure. Surface roughness is significantly elevated due to this contamination, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 2.5 to 3.8 µm. The contaminant layer itself shows a complex structure; it's not a single homogenous film but rather an agglomeration of different materials. We observe areas of thick, crust-like deposits adjacent to regions of thinner, more diffuse staining. This heterogeneous composition suggests a multi-stage contamination process, perhaps from different sources or over an extended period. The underlying metallic cerium substrate is almost entirely obscured, its original reflectivity and surface integrity completely compromised by this overlying, irregular film.
  afterText: The laser cleaning process achieves a dramatic transformation, restoring the cerium surface to a state of high purity and integrity. Post-treatment analysis at 500x reveals the complete removal of the previously documented contaminant layer, exposing the underlying metallic substrate. The surface now displays a uniform, matte-gray appearance characteristic of clean cerium, with a significant reduction in visual texture. The original, thick oxide scale has been ablated, leaving behind a much thinner, more uniform passivation layer measured at just 0.5 to 1.2 µm—or more precisely, an average of 0.8 µm. Quantitative surface roughness measurements confirm this visual improvement, with Ra values now falling within a narrow band of 0.8 to 1
