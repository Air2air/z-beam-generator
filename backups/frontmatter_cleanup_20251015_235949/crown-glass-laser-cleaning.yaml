caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the crown glass surface is obscured by a heterogeneous
    contamination layer approximately 2-5 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, including sub-micron silicate dust and carbonaceous soot, embedded in
    a thin, amorphous film of organic residues. The underlying glass substrate, with
    its characteristic hardness of 5.5 Mohs, is partially visible through localized
    microfractures and pinhole defects within the contaminant matrix. The contamination
    disrupts the native surface, which typically exhibits a roughness of 0.5 nm Ra,
    creating a topographically complex and optically scattering interface that significantly
    degrades light transmission and introduces wavefront error.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its pristine state. The
    contaminant layer is entirely removed, revealing the original polished surface
    with its 0.5 nm Ra roughness. The glass now exhibits its intrinsic 1.523 refractive
    index and high laser damage threshold of 25 J/cm², with no observable subsurface
    damage or micro-fractures from the cleaning process.
