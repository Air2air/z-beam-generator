caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the maple surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, dried oils, and microbial biofilms, fills the natural wood pores and masks
    the underlying cellular structure. The surface texture is irregular and matte,
    with contamination adhering strongly to the porous, fibrous network of the maple,
    significantly increasing its visual surface roughness.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively restored the native maple substrate. The
    contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the clean, open vessels and
    distinct ray cells of the wood's anatomy. The surface now exhibits the original,
    characteristic grain pattern with a texture measuring approximately 3.2 µm Ra.
    The process has achieved selective ablation of contaminants without carbonizing
    the underlying cellulose-lignin matrix, resulting in a pristine, well-defined
    microscopic surface.
