subtitle: Bluestone's composition and porosity can vary significantly between slabs.
  This variability requires careful adjustment of laser settings to effectively clean
  without damaging the stone's surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bluestone surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    particulate matter (soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of organic and inorganic
    deposits, such as gypsum crusts from atmospheric sulfur. The underlying quartz
    and feldspar grains of the stone are partially masked, with contaminants filling
    the natural micro-pores (8.5% porosity) and creating a discontinuous, crust-like
    texture. The original surface morphology is lost, replaced by an amorphous, pitted
    topography that increases light scattering and gives the stone its darkened, dull
    appearance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x magnification reveals a restored bluestone
    substrate. The contamination layer has been selectively ablated, exposing the
    original mineral grains and the stone's intrinsic micro-texture. The surface now
    displays clear intergranular boundaries and open pores, with minimal residual
    particulate matter. The removal of the light-scattering crust results in a surface
    with defined topography and restored reflectivity. This state confirms the successful
    elimination of damaging salts and biological films, returning the stone to a stable,
    clean condition without subsurface thermal damage.
