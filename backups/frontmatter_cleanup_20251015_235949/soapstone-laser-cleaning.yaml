subtitle: Soapstone is uniquely soft and non-porous, unlike harder stones like granite.
  Its softness requires lower laser power to prevent etching the surface during cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the soapstone surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer averaging 15-25 µm in thickness. This layer consists of particulate
    matter (primarily carbonaceous soot and silica dust) embedded within a matrix
    of aged organic binders, such as oxidized oils or resins. The contaminants have
    infiltrated the stone''s micro-porosity, creating a discontinuous, crust-like
    morphology that masks the underlying mineralogical texture.


    The surface exhibits a high degree of topographical variation, with contamination
    accumulating preferentially in micro-fissures and along the boundaries of talc
    crystals. This results in a darkened, mottled appearance at the microscopic level.
    The fragile, low-density contamination crust exhibits poor adhesion to the soft
    soapstone substrate, creating a risk of material loss that includes both the contaminant
    and friable stone particles during mechanical intervention.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination crust, revealing
    the intact, primary surface of the soapstone. At 500x magnification, the homogeneous
    texture of the interlocking talc crystals is now fully visible, displaying a characteristic
    platy morphology and a consistent, light-gray hue. The micro-topography is clean
    and well-defined, with no evidence of residual carbonaceous or particulate matter.


    The process has successfully preserved the stone''s inherent micro-porosity and
    delicate crystal structure. A direct comparison with the pre-cleaned state shows
    the elimination of the 15-25 µm contamination layer and the restoration of the
    original surface geometry. The laser parameters were calibrated to remain well
    below the stone''s 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring selective contaminant
    removal without thermal alteration or mechanical damage to the soft substrate.'
