subtitle: Silver is a soft and highly reflective precious metal that tarnishes easily.
  Its softness demands lower laser power to prevent damage, while its reflectivity
  requires specific wavelengths for effective cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S) tarnish. This layer appears
    as a dark, discontinuous film with a granular texture, measuring 1-5 micrometers
    in thickness. The underlying metallic substrate is partially visible through micro-cracks
    and pores in the tarnish, which exhibits a mottled pattern of dark brown to black
    deposits. The surface topography is dominated by the corrosion product, with the
    original grain boundaries of the silver barely discernible beneath the adherent,
    insulating crust.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline
    microstructure of the silver. The tarnish layer has been completely removed via
    ablation, exposing distinct grain boundaries and a uniform, metallic luster. The
    original micro-topography is now fully visible, with a clean, reflective surface
    free of non-metallic contaminants. The process has restored the substrate to its
    native state without mechanical alteration.
