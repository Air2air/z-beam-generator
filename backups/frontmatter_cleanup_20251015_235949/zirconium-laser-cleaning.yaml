caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zirconium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous particulates and a discontinuous oxide scale, creating a topographically
    complex and rough surface. The underlying metal's fine grain structure is entirely
    masked. The contamination adheres in a patchy, dendritic pattern, which compromises
    the material's inherent corrosion resistance and creates potential sites for localized
    pitting.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native zirconium surface, revealing a
    uniform, light-grey metallic substrate. The fine, equiaxed grain structure of
    the HCP matrix is now clearly visible at 500x. Surface roughness is significantly
    reduced to its intrinsic 0.4 µm Ra, with the process completely removing all oxide
    scale and embedded contaminants without imparting any macroscopic damage to the
    underlying metal.
