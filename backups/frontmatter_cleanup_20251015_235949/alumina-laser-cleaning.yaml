caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    carbonaceous deposits, particulate inclusions (1-10 µm), and adsorbed organic
    films. The underlying alumina's fine-grained, hexagonal crystalline structure
    is entirely masked. The contaminant morphology is irregular, creating a textured,
    high-relief topography that scatters light and appears dark and mottled. This
    layer disrupts the substrate's intrinsic thermal and electrical surface properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, polycrystalline alumina substrate.
    The surface now exhibits a uniform, fine-grained microstructure with clearly defined
    grain boundaries. All contamination has been removed, restoring the material's
    inherent light-gray appearance and smooth topography. The surface is now optically
    homogeneous and suitable for high-integrity applications.
