  to their inconsistent heat resistance. Adjust your power levels below 50 watts initially,
  then ramp up slowly to protect the material’s surface from unintended scorching.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface is obscured
    by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer
    consists of embedded particulate matter and a carbonaceous film, which masks the
    substrate's original molded texture. The contaminants create a discontinuous,
    mottled pattern, filling the micro-porosity of the composite and significantly
    increasing surface roughness. This layer disrupts the material's inherent low
    reflectivity and compromises surface-dependent properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively restores the substrate, revealing the pristine
    phenolic resin composite surface. At 500x magnification, the contamination layer
    is entirely removed, exposing the original, finely textured mold pattern and the
    distinct, fibrous reinforcement material. Surface roughness is reduced to the
    material's intrinsic 0.8 µm Ra, and the micro-porosity is now clean and open.
    The surface is uniform, with no evidence of thermal degradation, demonstrating
    a complete return to baseline topography.
