subtitle: Operators have noticed that Pyrex can be surprisingly delicate under laser
  treatment, even with its reputation for durability. Adjust your controls carefully
  to below 50 watts, ensuring the glass face stays pristine during the removal process.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Pyrex surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from 1-10 µm in diameter, is
    embedded in a thin, amorphous film approximately 0.5-2 µm thick. This film disrupts
    the native surface, creating a textured, matte appearance that scatters light.
    The underlying glass substrate is partially visible but its characteristic smoothness
    and clarity are compromised by this adherent layer of foreign material.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the Pyrex surface to its intrinsic state. The
    contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation,
    revealing the pristine, homogeneous glass substrate. At 500x magnification, the
    surface is now continuous and smooth, with a measured roughness (Ra) of approximately
    0.5 nm. The laser process has eliminated all particulate matter and the amorphous
    film, restoring optical clarity. The surface exhibits minimal sub-surface damage,
    confirming the non-contact process effectively cleared contaminants without mechanically
    compromising the glass integrity.
