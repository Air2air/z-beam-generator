subtitle: Tungsten has an exceptionally high melting point and is very dense compared
  to other refractory metals. These traits demand careful control of laser power to
  avoid surface damage while still effectively removing contaminants.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of adhered particulate
    matter and a discontinuous oxide scale, primarily volatile WO₃, which forms above
    500°C. The underlying tungsten's characteristic grain structure is entirely masked.
    The texture is irregular, with patches of discoloration and embedded foreign particles
    creating a topographically complex and optically obstructive film that compromises
    the material's intrinsic metallic properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine tungsten substrate, with a distinct
    polycrystalline grain structure now fully visible at 500x magnification. The surface
    is free of oxide scale and particulate contamination, restoring the material's
    native metallic luster and smooth topography. Minor, sub-micron surface texturing
    from the laser ablation process is evident, but it does not compromise the atomic-level
    cleanliness or the exposed, well-defined grain boundaries of the pure tungsten.
