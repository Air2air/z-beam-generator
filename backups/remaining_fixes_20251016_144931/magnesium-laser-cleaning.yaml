caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, such as embedded alumina from handling, and a patchy oxide/hydroxide film.
    The underlying HCP crystalline structure is entirely hidden. The topography is
    chaotic, with contamination filling the natural grain boundaries and valleys of
    the metal substrate, creating a textured, matte appearance that scatters light.
    This layer compromises surface-dependent properties and acts as a site for ongoing
    localized corrosion.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine magnesium substrate, restoring its
    intrinsic metallic luster. At 500x, the surface now exhibits clearly defined grain
    boundaries and the fine, directional polishing lines of the underlying metal.
    The contamination layer has been completely ablated, with no residual oxide patches
    or embedded particles. The result is a topographically uniform surface with a
    measured roughness near the base material's 0.8 µm Ra. This optically clean state
    ensures optimal performance for subsequent processes like bonding or coating.
