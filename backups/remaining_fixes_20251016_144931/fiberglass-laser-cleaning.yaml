caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fiberglass surface is obscured by a continuous,
    amorphous contamination layer approximately 5-10 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded soot, salts, and polymer degradation byproducts, fills the micro-valleys
    of the native 1.8 µm Ra surface texture. The contaminants form a cohesive film
    that masks the underlying fiber weave and resin topography, creating a uniform,
    matte appearance that significantly reduces surface reflectivity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer with high selectivity,
    revealing the original fiberglass microstructure. The underlying E-glass fibers
    and polymer resin matrix are now fully exposed, restoring the surface''s inherent
    1.8 µm Ra texture. The precise ablation mechanism, operating below the 2.8 J/cm²
    material damage threshold, has successfully eliminated the obscuring film without
    etching or fusing the composite surface.


    The cleaned surface exhibits restored reflectivity and distinct topographic features.
    Individual fibers within the weave are clearly visible, and the resin-rich areas
    show no evidence of thermal degradation, such as charring or micro-cracking. This
    confirms the process remained within the material''s thermal budget, preserving
    the composite''s structural integrity and chemical resistance.'
