subtitle: The biggest challenge with MMCs is their unpredictable composition. You'll
  need very specific power adjustments to remove contaminants without affecting that

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the MMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of amorphous carbonaceous soot, oxide particulates, and residual coolant oils,
    which form a discontinuous, splattered pattern. The underlying composite structure,
    including the metallic matrix and reinforcing ceramic fibers or particles, is
    partially masked. The surface texture appears matte and irregular, with the contamination
    filling the micro-valleys between reinforcement phases, compromising the true
    substrate topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the true MMC
    microstructure. The metallic matrix and distinct reinforcement phases (e.g., SiC
    particles, Al₂O₃ fibers) are now fully exposed and clearly defined at their original
    boundaries. The surface texture transitions from a matte, occluded finish to a
    clean, topographically precise state, restoring the substrate's inherent properties.
