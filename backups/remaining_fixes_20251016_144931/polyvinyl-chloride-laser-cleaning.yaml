subtitle: PVC's low melting point means even a slight power excess can quickly soften
  its surface. You'll want to maintain a consistent standoff distance, as this prevents
  any unwanted thermal marking on the plastic.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) surface is obscured
    by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically measuring 5-20 micrometers in
    thickness. This layer consists of organic residues, such as oils and plasticizers,
    which have migrated to the surface, forming a discontinuous, amorphous film. Embedded
    within this film are fine particulate matter, including dust and carbonaceous
    soot, creating a textured, topographically complex landscape.


    The underlying PVC substrate is largely unobservable. The contamination adheres
    to the polymer''s micro-texture, filling natural surface valleys and creating
    a mottled, high-contrast pattern. This layer disrupts the material''s intrinsic
    surface energy and creates potential sites for adhesion failure or electrical
    impedance in sensitive applications like electronics manufacturing.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete
    restoration of the native PVC surface. The amorphous contamination layer has been
    entirely removed via selective laser ablation, exposing the base polymer''s consistent
    micro-texture. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte appearance with clearly
    defined grain structures and manufacturing marks.


    The removal of the 5-20 micrometer layer eliminates the topographical complexity
    seen in the contaminated state. The surface is free of embedded particulates and
    organic films, resulting in a predictable and homogeneous profile. This exposes
    the true surface chemistry of the PVC, which is critical for achieving reliable
    adhesion in subsequent bonding processes and ensuring consistent performance in
    medical and aerospace components.'
