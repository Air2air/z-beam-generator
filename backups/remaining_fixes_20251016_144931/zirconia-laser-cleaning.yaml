subtitle: Zirconia often throws curveballs during laser treatment due to its varying
  hardness across samples. Adjust your power levels incrementally, starting below
  50 watts, to protect the ceramic’s surface from unintended etching.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of
    carbonaceous soot, metallic oxides, and adhered organic residues. The contaminants
    form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern that masks the underlying ceramic's fine-grain
    microstructure. The surface texture appears matte and irregular, with the foreign
    material filling the natural micro-porosity of the sintered ceramic, significantly
    reducing its inherent reflectivity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a
    complete transformation. The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing
    the pristine, polycrystalline grain structure of the zirconia. The surface is
    now characterized by a uniform, micro-rough texture consistent with the material's
    intrinsic 2.5% porosity. This restoration results in a visually clean, homogenous
    substrate with restored reflectivity, free from any residual film or heat-affected
    zone that could compromise its mechanical integrity.
