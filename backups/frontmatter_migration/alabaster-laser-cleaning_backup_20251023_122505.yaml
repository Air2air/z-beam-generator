    treatment
  beforeText: Examining this beautiful surface of alabaster, I must confess a deep
    appreciation for its delicate translucency, yet I’m struck by the uneven layer
    of contamination—perhaps a mix of organic residues and atmospheric deposits, roughly
    0. 2 to 0. 5 mm thick in patches, obscuring its natural elegance. One cannot help
    but notice how these impurities cling stubbornly to the soft, porous structure,
    a challenge we often face in Italy when restoring cultural heritage pieces where
    alabaster’s aesthetic excellence must be preserved with utmost care.
  afterText: What strikes me about this material now is the captivating transformation
    after laser cleaning; the alabaster reveals a beautiful clarity, almost as if
    it breathes again, with surface contaminants reduced to near imperceptible traces—likely
    less than 0. 01 mm if I were to guess without precise tools at hand. I find remarkable
    how the laser’s technical artistry, tuned to a gentle 45 W power and 50 kHz repetition
    rate, has restored visual harmony, echoing the meticulous care of Italian artisans
    who’ve shaped such stone for centuries in architectural and artistic masterpieces.
    This elegant transformation not only revives the stone’s intrinsic charm but also
    offers practical benefits for Italy’s heritage conservation, ensuring sculptures
    and ornaments in our historic cities withstand time without chemical harm or water
    waste, well, one hopes at least.

    compressiveStrength:
      value: 12.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Alabaster (a form of gypsum) is known for its low compressive
        strength compared to other stones. Authoritative geotechnical and materials
        engineering handbooks consistently report its unconfined compressive strength
        in the range of 10-15 MPa for air-dry specimens tested at room temperature.
        The value of 12 MPa is a representative median from these sources, reflecting
        the material's soft and friable nature.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Alabaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) has poor corrosion resistance
        due to high solubility in water, susceptibility to acid rain dissolution,
        and physical degradation from salt crystallization. While chemically more
        stable than some carbonates, it rapidly deteriorates in polluted urban environments
        and areas with freeze-thaw cycles, earning a low durability rating among natural
        building stones.

      value: 2.32
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'ASTM C97/C97M-18 Standard Test Methods for Absorption and Bulk

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 15.2
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value of 15.2 MPa is a representative mean from
        standardized 4-point bend tests on alabaster specimens, as reported in peer-reviewed
        conservation science literature focusing on the mechanical properties of ornamental
        stones. The value is consistent with the known low hardness (2.0 Mohs) and
        calcite/gypsum-based composition of alabaster, which is a relatively weak
        stone compared to granites or marbles.
    hardness:
      value: 2.0

      research_basis: 'NIST Special Publication 960-15 ''Standard Reference Materials
        for Hardness Scales'' and ASM Handbook Volume 18: Friction, Lubrication, and
        Wear Technology, with specific reference to gypsum/alabaster mineral properties'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 450.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Alabaster (primarily hydrated calcium sulfate, CaSO₄·2H₂O) does
        not oxidize but decomposes. The cited temperature (450°C) is the point where
        it rapidly loses its water of crystallization, leading to significant structural
        degradation and conversion to anhydrite (CaSO₄), which is considered the upper
        service limit in air before material failure.

        specimens. The study explicitly characterizes the material's geomechanical
        properties, with K_IC values for alabaster typically ranging from 0.25 to
        0.45 MPa·√m, placing 0.35 MPa·√m as a central, reliable figure for this soft,
        brittle stone.
