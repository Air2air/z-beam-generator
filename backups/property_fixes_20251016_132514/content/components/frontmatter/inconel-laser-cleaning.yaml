caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Inconel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of complex oxides,
    carbon deposits, and embedded foreign particles, forming a topographically rough
    and discontinuous crust. The underlying alloy's fine-grained, FCC microstructure
    is entirely concealed. The surface exhibits a cracked, sintered appearance with
    low reflectivity, a direct result of prolonged exposure to high-temperature, oxidizing
    service environments.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, metallurgically intact Inconel substrate.
    The contaminant crust is completely removed, exposing the original, fine-grained
    gamma matrix with its characteristic precipitate structure. The surface texture
    is now defined by the material's intrinsic grain boundaries, not foreign deposits.
    Reflectivity increases significantly due to the restoration of the bare metal
    surface. The process achieves this transformation with minimal thermal input,
    preserving the base material's hardness and strength by avoiding microstructural
    alterations like recrystallization or phase changes.
