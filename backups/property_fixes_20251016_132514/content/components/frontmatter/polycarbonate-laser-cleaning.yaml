  compared to other plastics. This demands very precise laser settings with low power
  to avoid damaging the surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a complex
    topography of particulate agglomerates and organic films, which adhere to the
    native substrate. The underlying polycarbonate's amorphous structure is completely
    masked. The contaminants create a textured, irregular surface that significantly
    scatters incident light, degrading optical clarity and increasing surface roughness
    to an estimated 1.5 µm Ra.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine polycarbonate substrate, revealing
    its characteristic amorphous, glassy morphology. The contaminant layer is completely
    ablated, with no residual film or particulate matter observed. The surface texture
    is now defined by the polymer's intrinsic 0.02 µm Ra roughness, resulting in a
    uniform, smooth plane. This restoration re-establishes the material's high optical
    transmissivity and original surface energy.
