caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides and carbonaceous deposits, forming a textured, matte topography. The underlying
    metal's grain structure is entirely concealed by this discontinuous, particulate-laden
    film, which exhibits micro-cracking and localized spallation.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the native metallic surface, revealing
    the fine, polygonal grain structure characteristic of vanadium''s body-centered
    cubic lattice. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, with no residual
    oxide islands or embedded particulates.


    The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey metallic finish with clearly defined
    grain boundaries. The process has achieved this result without inducing surface
    melting or heat-affected zone microcracking, preserving the substrate''s integrity.


    This pristine surface condition, free from the 5-20 µm contamination layer, ensures
    optimal performance for subsequent operations in demanding applications, providing
    a clean interface for bonding, coating, or service.'
