caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the limestone surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A heterogeneous crust, 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres
    tenaciously to the calcite matrix. This layer is a composite of particulate matter,
    gypsum-rich black crusts, and biological films, which fill the natural micropores
    (approx. 5% porosity). The original crystalline texture is masked, and micro-fractures
    are often bridged by these deposits, creating a continuous, degraded surface profile
    that compromises the stone's integrity and appearance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine calcite matrix, restoring the stone's
    intrinsic micro-topography. At 500x, the surface exhibits a clean, interlocking
    crystalline structure with clearly defined grain boundaries. The 5% micro-porosity
    is now fully open and free of occluding deposits. The process has successfully
    removed the contamination crust without inducing micro-fractures or thermal alteration,
    leaving a mineralogically intact surface that reflects the original stone fabric.
