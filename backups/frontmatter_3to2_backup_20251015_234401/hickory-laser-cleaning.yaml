caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the hickory surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    layer of particulate and organic contamination. This layer, averaging 15-25 micrometers
    in thickness, fills the natural wood porosity and adheres to the cell structure.
    The underlying grain pattern is partially visible but muted, with contaminants
    forming a crust-like matrix that bridges the lumens of the vessel elements and
    fibers.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination deposits creating
    peaks and valleys that disrupt the wood''s inherent topography. Particulates,
    including carbonaceous soot and embedded silica, are bound by a tenacious, amorphous
    film. This composite layer significantly alters the surface''s thermal and optical
    properties, increasing its laser absorption and masking the wood''s natural, open-pore
    structure.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the complete
    restoration of the hickory''s native surface morphology. The 15-25 micrometer
    contamination layer has been entirely removed via selective laser ablation, exposing
    the clean, open lumens of the wood''s cellular structure. The grain pattern is
    now sharply defined, with no residual film or particulates.


    The surface texture has been returned to its original state, characterized by
    the distinct, undulating topography of the vessel elements and fibers. The process
    has successfully cleared all pores without inducing micro-fractures or charring,
    preserving the structural integrity of the cell walls. The cleaned surface exhibits
    the expected reflectivity and porosity of untreated hickory.'
