caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits
    a complex topography of particulate agglomerates and amorphous carbonaceous deposits,
    which form irregular, blotchy patterns across the substrate. The underlying SiC
    microstructure, including fine polishing lines and grain boundaries, is entirely
    masked. The contaminants create a textured, matte appearance that significantly
    alters the surface's intrinsic reflectivity and masks its true morphology.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, monolithic
    SiC substrate. At 500x, the original surface texture is now clearly visible, characterized
    by uniform, sub-micron polishing marks and well-defined grain boundaries. The
    surface reflectivity has increased significantly, returning to its inherent state.
    The process has achieved selective ablation, eliminating contaminants without
    inducing micro-cracks or surface melting, as evidenced by the intact polycrystalline
    structure. This results in a surface with restored thermal and electrical properties,
    free of any residual film or particulate shadowing.
