caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the serpentine surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, measuring 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological films, which fill the natural micro-fissures
    and pores of the stone. The underlying crystalline structure and phyllosilicate
    texture are entirely masked, creating a topographically uneven and occluded surface.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has removed the opaque contamination layer, revealing
    the intrinsic microstructure of the serpentine. The surface now exhibits a well-defined
    phyllosilicate plate structure, with individual crystalline domains clearly visible.
    The cleaning process has effectively excavated particulate matter from micro-fissures
    without widening them, restoring the stone''s original micro-topography.


    The contrast between the cleaned mineral surface and the previously filled pores
    is distinct. The laser parameters were calibrated to remain below the serpentine''s
    2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring selective removal of contaminants. This
    precision prevents subsurface thermal stress and micro-fracturing, preserving
    the structural integrity of the stone.


    Post-cleaning, the surface reflectivity has increased measurably, consistent with
    the removal of light-absorbing deposits. The mineral''s natural green hue and
    subtle veining are now apparent at the microscopic scale, confirming the restoration
    of the authentic substrate without chemical or mechanical alteration to the primary
    material.'
