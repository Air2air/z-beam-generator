subtitle: Operators have learned that rubber performs best when you start with minimal
  power, around 20 watts. Gradually increase to match its variable density, ensuring
  the laser doesn’t overheat the outer layer during treatment.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rubber surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of embedded carbonaceous
    soot, oxidized polymer chains, and particulate matter. The contaminants form a
    discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying rubber's texture, filling
    the natural micro-fissures and valleys. The surface morphology is highly irregular,
    with agglomerated particles creating a topographically rough and uneven profile.
    This layer significantly alters the surface's properties, increasing its roughness
    and reducing its effective coefficient of friction. The original elastomeric matrix
    is no longer visible, as the contaminants have created a brittle, composite crust
    on the compliant substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native elastomeric state.
    At 500x magnification, the contaminant crust is entirely absent, revealing the
    rubber's intrinsic micro-texture of interconnected fibrils and shallow pores.
    The surface is now uniform and continuous, with no evidence of thermal damage
    or ablation of the base material. The removal of the particulate-filled layer
    has re-established the material's original surface energy and topography. This
    results in a clean, chemically active surface that is optimal for subsequent processes
    like bonding or coating, with the rubber's fundamental viscoelastic properties
    fully preserved.
