subtitle: The biggest challenge with GFRP is its inconsistent resin-to-fiber ratio.
  You must use very specific power adjustments to remove contaminants without affecting
  the underlying composite structure.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GFRP surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of accumulated
    soot, salt crystals, and organic residues, creates a coarse, uneven texture that
    masks the underlying composite structure. The contamination adheres in patches,
    with particulate matter embedded within a thin, amorphous film. This obscures
    the individual glass fibers and the polymer matrix, preventing a clear assessment
    of the substrate's condition.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete removal
    of the contaminant layer, exposing the pristine GFRP substrate. The individual
    glass filaments, typically 10-20 µm in diameter, are now fully visible and distinct,
    embedded within the undamaged polymer matrix. The surface texture is significantly
    smoother, transitioning from a coarse, occluded profile to the characteristic
    micro-texture of the composite itself. This process effectively ablates contaminants
    without generating mechanical striations or causing observable thermal degradation
    to the matrix, preserving the structural integrity of the fibers and their interfacial
    bond. The cleaned surface allows for accurate inspection for pre-existing microcracks
    or fiber damage.
