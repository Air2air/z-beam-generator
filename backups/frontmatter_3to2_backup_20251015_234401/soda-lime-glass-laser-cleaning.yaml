caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface is obscured by a
    discontinuous contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 0.5 to 5 micrometers
    in thickness, consists of particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film.
    The underlying glass topography, with a native roughness of approximately 0.5
    nm Ra, is completely masked. The contaminants exhibit an irregular, mottled pattern,
    creating significant surface heterogeneity. This layer scatters light and increases
    diffuse reflection, directly impairing optical transmission and compromising the
    surface's intended functional performance in its application.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals the pristine
    soda-lime glass substrate. The contamination layer has been completely removed
    via selective laser ablation, restoring the original surface with a roughness
    near its intrinsic 0.5 nm Ra. The transformation is evident in the uniform, homogeneous
    texture now visible. The surface is free of micro-fractures and thermal stress
    damage, confirming the process remained below the material's ~15 J/cm² damage
    threshold. This restoration of atomic-level surface integrity ensures optimal
    optical clarity and mechanical performance, critical for high-precision applications.
