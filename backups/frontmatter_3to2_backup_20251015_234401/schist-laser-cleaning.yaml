subtitle: Schist has a unique, flaky layered structure and variable mineral composition.
  This requires careful adjustment of laser settings to clean effectively without
  damaging its delicate surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the schist surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres to the
    foliated stone matrix. This layer consists of particulate matter, carbonaceous
    deposits, and biological growth, filling the natural micro-fissures and foliation
    planes. The contaminants form an irregular, matte-textured film that masks the
    underlying mineralogy and surface topography, significantly reducing light reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination crust, revealing
    the pristine schist substrate. The distinct foliation planes and interlocking
    crystals of mica and quartz are now fully exposed, restoring the stone's inherent
    texture. The surface exhibits a clean, well-defined topography with a measurable
    increase in reflectivity, confirming the selective and non-abrasive nature of
    the contaminant removal.
