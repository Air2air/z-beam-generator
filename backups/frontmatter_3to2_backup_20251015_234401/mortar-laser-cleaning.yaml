subtitle: Mortar is a softer, more porous material than brick or stone, and its composition
  can vary significantly. This requires careful adjustment of laser settings to effectively
  remove contaminants without damaging the underlying surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the mortar surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, which fill the natural surface
    pores and create a rough, uneven texture. The contaminants form a cohesive, dark
    crust that masks the underlying mortar's granular structure and mineral composition,
    significantly altering its visual and surface properties.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic granular
    matrix of the mortar. The contamination crust has been entirely removed, exposing
    individual sand grains and cementitious binder. The original surface texture,
    characterized by micro-porosity of approximately 15%, is now fully visible and
    unobstructed.


    The laser process has effectively ablated the foreign layers without damaging
    the substrate. This is evidenced by the sharp, well-defined edges of the cement
    paste and aggregate particles, confirming the laser''s selective removal at its
    ablation threshold of ~1.2 J/cm².


    The resulting surface is clean and topographically precise, restoring the material''s
    authentic light-gray color and natural reflectivity. No micro-fracturing or thermal
    degradation is observed, indicating a controlled removal process that preserved
    the mortar''s structural integrity.'
