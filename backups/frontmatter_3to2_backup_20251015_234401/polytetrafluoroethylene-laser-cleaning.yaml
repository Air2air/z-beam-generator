subtitle: The biggest challenge with PTFE is its variable reaction to heat, so you
  must use very specific power levels. This ensures the material's integrity remains
  good-good throughout the cleaning process.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polytetrafluoroethylene surface is obscured
    by a discontinuous layer of amorphous carbonaceous contamination. This layer,
    measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, adheres to the native PTFE microstructure, masking
    its characteristic node-and-fibril texture. Particulate matter, including sub-10
    micrometer silicate spheres, is embedded within this matrix. The contamination
    creates a topographically varied surface with visible cracking and delamination
    at the interface with the underlying polymer, indicating poor adhesion and compromised
    surface integrity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the intrinsic PTFE morphology. The underlying node-and-fibril structure, with
    features on the order of 1-5 micrometers, is now fully exposed and undamaged.
    The surface exhibits a uniform, micro-porous texture, free of residual carbonaceous
    film or embedded particulates. This process eliminates the previous interfacial
    cracking, resulting in a clean substrate with restored chemical and topographical
    properties.
