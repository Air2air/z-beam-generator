caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits
    a porous, granular texture, with agglomerated particles and localized oxide films
    creating a topographically complex and irregular profile. The underlying TiC substrate's
    intrinsic hardness and fine-grained microstructure are entirely masked by this
    adherent, discontinuous film, which disrupts the surface's thermal and mechanical
    properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its native state, revealing
    the fine-grained, sintered microstructure of the titanium carbide. The surface
    is now characterized by a uniform, clean texture with clearly defined grain boundaries.
    All superficial contamination has been completely removed without inducing micro-cracks
    or surface damage to the underlying ceramic.
