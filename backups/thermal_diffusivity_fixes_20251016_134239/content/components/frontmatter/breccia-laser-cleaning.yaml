caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the breccia surface is obscured by a discontinuous,
    particulate-rich contamination layer averaging 15-45 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of soot, dust, and biological growth, fills the natural micro-fissures and pores
    of the stone matrix. The underlying angular clasts and cementing minerals are
    partially masked, with the contamination adhering most densely within the stone's
    inherent porosity, creating a mottled, occluded surface texture.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively restored the intrinsic lithic character
    of the breccia. The previously occluding contamination layer has been entirely
    removed, revealing the sharp, angular boundaries of individual clasts and the
    complex, interlocking texture of the mineral cement. The surface now exhibits
    its natural micro-relief, with open pores and fissures cleared of particulate
    matter.


    The selective nature of the laser process is evident. The ablation threshold was
    precisely calibrated to target the contaminant''s binding organics and particulate
    matter, which vaporized at energy densities below the stone''s own ablation threshold
    of 2.8 J/cm². This has preserved the structural integrity of the mineral grains,
    leaving no thermal stress microfractures or mineral phase alterations visible
    at this magnification.


    The result is a surface defined by its original geological composition. The contrast
    between clasts of varying hardness and color is now fully apparent, and the stone''s
    natural porosity (approximately 8%) is visibly open and unobstructed, indicating
    a successful return to the substrate''s authentic, unweathered state without mechanical
    or chemical residue.'
