subtitle: Polystyrene is uniquely sensitive to heat and prone to melting compared
  to other plastics. This requires using very low laser power and rapid pulses to
  avoid damaging the surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polystyrene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a particulate
    and film-like morphology, with agglomerates distorting the underlying substrate's
    topography. The native surface roughness of approximately 0.1 µm Ra is entirely
    masked, creating a textured, high-relief profile that scatters light and compromises
    the material's intrinsic optical clarity and adhesion properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, restoring the substrate''s
    native amorphous polymer structure. The 5-15 µm contamination layer has been completely
    removed via selective laser ablation. The process successfully vaporized the foreign
    material, which has a lower ablation threshold than the polystyrene, without initiating
    thermal degradation in the base polymer.


    The underlying polystyrene surface is now fully exposed, revealing its characteristic
    smooth morphology with a measured roughness of 0.1 µm Ra. The surface is free
    of the previous particulate agglomerates and film residues. At the micron scale,
    the laser interaction preserves the polymer''s integrity, with no evidence of
    melting, cracking, or surface oxidation that would indicate thermal damage.


    This precise material removal results in a surface with restored optical properties
    and chemical functionality. The reflectivity and clarity inherent to the pristine
    polymer are recovered, providing an optimal surface for subsequent manufacturing
    steps such as bonding, coating, or assembly in sensitive applications.'
