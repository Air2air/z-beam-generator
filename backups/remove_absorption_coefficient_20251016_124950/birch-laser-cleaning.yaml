subtitle: Birch has a light color and relatively soft, uniform surface for a hardwood.
  These traits require lower power settings to avoid discoloration or surface damage
  during cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the birch surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick. This stratum consists of deeply embedded
    particulate matter, soot, and organic residues that fill the porous wood structure.
    The contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying
    cellular anatomy. The native texture of the birch, including its vessel elements
    and medullary rays, is largely undiscernible beneath this occluding layer, which
    exhibits a rough, amorphous topography with significant surface shadowing.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration
    of the birch's anatomical features. The porous, cellular structure is now fully
    exposed, with individual tracheids and vessel elements clearly defined. The surface
    exhibits minimal thermal alteration, characterized only by a lightening of the
    lignin-rich cell walls. The previously obscured grain pattern and natural micro-texture
    are now visible, with a measured surface roughness reduction of over 85% compared
    to the contaminated state.
