subtitle: Gallium arsenide is more fragile and heat-sensitive than silicon, its common
  counterpart. This demands laser cleaning with lower power and shorter pulses to
  prevent surface damage.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GaAs surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 1-5 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, hydrocarbon films, and adsorbed moisture, creating a textured, matte appearance.
    The contaminants scatter light and mask the underlying crystalline structure,
    forming irregular patterns of residue that compromise surface integrity and interfere
    with subsequent processing steps. The native substrate is not visible through
    this film.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a dramatic transformation.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, monolithic
    GaAs crystal. At 500x, the surface is now continuous and smooth, with the material's
    inherent granularity from its zinc blende structure clearly visible. Laser parameters
    are tuned to remain below the 0.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring no phase
    change or subsurface damage. This results in an atomically clean surface with
    restored optical and electronic properties.
