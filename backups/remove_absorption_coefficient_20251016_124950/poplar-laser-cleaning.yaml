caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the poplar surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, dust, and organic residues, fills the wood's porous structure, masking the
    characteristic cellular anatomy. The surface texture is irregular and crust-like,
    with no visible wood grain or cell wall definition, indicating significant particulate
    accumulation within the lumen of the vessels and fibers.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the intact, underlying wood microstructure. The porous network of vessels and
    fibers is now fully exposed, with cell walls appearing sharp and well-defined.
    The original surface texture is restored, showing the natural grain pattern and
    anatomical features without the masking crust.


    The process achieves selective ablation, vaporizing contaminants at 380°C while
    the poplar substrate, with its low thermal conductivity of 0.12 W/m·K, remains
    largely unaffected. This precision prevents collateral thermal damage, preserving
    the structural integrity of the delicate cell walls. The result is a topographically
    clean surface with restored porosity and minimal residue, ready for further conservation
    or finishing steps.'
