caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface is obscured
    by a heterogeneous contamination layer. A discontinuous film, measuring 5-15 µm
    thick, adheres to the underlying fiber weave. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous particulates, salt crystals, and polymer degradation byproducts,
    creating a topographically complex and occluded surface.


    The contamination disrupts the composite''s intrinsic structure. The characteristic
    woven pattern of the 10-12 µm diameter Kevlar filaments is partially masked. The
    surface texture is dominated by the contaminant''s own morphology—featuring agglomerated
    deposits in interstitial spaces between fibers and a general loss of definition
    at the fiber-matrix interface, which appears smeared and indistinct.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the surface to its native state. The contaminant
    layer is completely removed, revealing the precise, woven architecture of the
    Kevlar filaments. Individual fibers, with their characteristic 10-12 µm diameter
    and longitudinal striations, are now fully exposed and distinct.


    The interface between the golden-yellow Kevlar fibers and the darker polymer matrix
    is sharply defined, with no residual debris in the inter-fiber spaces. The surface
    texture is now governed by the composite''s own microstructure, presenting a clean,
    well-defined topography free from the occluding deposits previously observed.'
