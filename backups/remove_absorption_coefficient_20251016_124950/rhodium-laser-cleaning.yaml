caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 2-5 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists
    of accumulated carbonaceous deposits, particulate matter, and adsorbed organic
    films. The underlying metal's characteristic fine grain structure is entirely
    masked. The contaminants exhibit a mottled, textured pattern, creating a topographically
    complex and optically diffuse surface that scatters light and significantly reduces
    reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate, revealing the intrinsic,
    fine-grained microstructure of the rhodium. The surface is now continuous and
    uniform, with contamination completely absent. This results in a microscopically
    smooth finish that maximizes the metal's inherent high reflectivity and surface
    integrity.
