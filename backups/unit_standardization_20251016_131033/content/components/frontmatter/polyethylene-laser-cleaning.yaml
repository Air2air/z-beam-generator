subtitle: Polyethylene has a lower melting point and is more chemically resistant
  than other plastics. These traits demand lower laser power and specific wavelength

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contaminant layer, approximately 5-10 µm thick. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and particulate matter, disrupts the native semi-crystalline texture.
    The underlying polymer morphology is concealed, with contaminants filling the
    micro-scale valleys of the 0.8 µm Ra surface, creating an irregular, occluded
    topography that compromises surface energy and adhesion.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contaminant layer, revealing
    the pristine, semi-crystalline microstructure of the polyethylene substrate. The
    original surface texture, with a characteristic roughness of 0.8 µm Ra, is now
    fully exposed and undamaged.


    The process has selectively ablated the contaminants without reaching the polymer''s
    melting point of 130°C, preserving the material''s integrity. The surface is now
    uniformly clean, with no residual film or heat-induced deformation, restoring
    optimal properties for subsequent manufacturing processes.'
