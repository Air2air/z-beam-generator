subtitle: The biggest challenge with CMCs is their inconsistent fiber density, which
  can create hot spots. You'll want to maintain a consistent standoff distance to
  ensure uniform energy distribution.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the CMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 10-50 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of embedded carbonaceous soot, silicate-rich dust particulates, and potential
    oxide scales from high-temperature service. The contaminants form an amorphous,
    crust-like blanket that adheres to the fiber-matrix architecture.


    The underlying SiC/SiC or C/SiC composite structure is largely hidden. The contamination
    creates a highly irregular surface texture, masking the characteristic woven fiber
    bundles and the ceramic matrix. Pores and micro-cracks within the composite are
    filled with fine particulate matter, which can act as initiation points for further
    degradation under thermal cycling.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restoration of the
    intrinsic CMC microstructure. The contaminant layer has been completely removed
    via ablation, exposing the clean, woven pattern of the ceramic fibers and the
    surrounding matrix. The surface texture is now defined by the material''s own
    topography rather than foreign deposits.


    The interface between fibers and matrix is clearly visible, with minimal residual
    particulate matter. The process successfully clears micro-cracks and pores, reducing
    potential stress concentration points. The laser parameters are tuned to achieve
    this selective removal while avoiding measurable ablation damage to the underlying
    SiC matrix, preserving the composite''s structural integrity.'
