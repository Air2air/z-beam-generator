caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the CFRP surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of organic residues
    and embedded particulate, which mask the underlying fiber weave and matrix texture.
    The contaminants form discontinuous, agglomerated patches that create a topographically
    complex and irregular surface profile, disrupting the intended composite morphology.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine composite substrate. The carbon fiber tows and the surrounding polymer
    matrix are now fully exposed, displaying their characteristic woven architecture
    and original surface texture. The removal is highly selective, eliminating contaminants
    without observable ablation of the underlying polymer resin.


    The surface topography is significantly smoother and more uniform, with the primary
    features now being the intrinsic grooves of the fiber weave and minor, sub-micron
    porosity from the manufacturing process. This restoration of the original surface
    geometry eliminates the stress concentrations previously posed by particulate
    agglomerates. The process results in a clean, well-defined interface, restoring
    the substrate for subsequent bonding or coating operations.'
