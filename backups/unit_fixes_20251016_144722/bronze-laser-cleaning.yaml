subtitle: Bronze is a softer alloy that is more susceptible to heat and surface oxidation
  than other non-ferrous metals. This requires careful adjustment of laser power and
  scanning speed to prevent melting or damaging the patina.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bronze surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of a tenacious,
    amorphous copper sulfide tarnish (Cu₂S) and particulate grime embedded within
    a porous matrix of copper carbonates. The underlying α-phase FCC crystalline structure
    of the bronze is entirely concealed. The texture is irregular and crust-like,
    with micro-fissures propagating through the corrosion products, which exhibit
    low adhesion to the substrate.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the stratified contamination layer,
    revealing the pristine, underlying bronze substrate. The surface now exhibits
    the characteristic microstructure of the α-phase FCC crystalline grains, with
    clearly defined grain boundaries. The texture is uniform, with a measured surface
    roughness of approximately 0.8 µm Ra, consistent with the original manufactured
    finish.


    The removal process has been highly selective, ablating the weakly adhered corrosion
    products without melting the bronze surface, which has a melting point of 950°C.
    This precision is confirmed by the preservation of fine, sub-micron machining
    marks and the absence of thermal etching or oxide discoloration. The surface is
    now metallurgically clean, with a reflectivity restored to its intrinsic 65% at
    1064 nm.'
