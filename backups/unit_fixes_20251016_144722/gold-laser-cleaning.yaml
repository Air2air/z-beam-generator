subtitle: Gold is exceptionally soft and prone to surface damage compared to other
  precious metals. This requires laser settings with very low energy and rapid pulses
  to remove contaminants without altering the surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the gold surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 0.5 to 5 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of carbonaceous deposits, adsorbed organic films, and particulate matter.
    The underlying gold's metallic luster is muted, and its native micro-texture is
    concealed. The contaminants form irregular, patchy patterns, creating a topographically
    complex and optically dull surface that compromises its functional properties
    and aesthetic signature.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine gold substrate, revealing a continuous,
    specularly reflective surface at 500x magnification. The contamination layer is
    entirely removed, exposing the native grain structure and micro-polishing lines
    of the pure gold. The surface is now topographically uniform, with no evidence
    of thermal damage or ablation to the substrate. This results in a surface with
    restored reflectivity exceeding 97% and optimal performance for its intended electrical
    or optical application.
