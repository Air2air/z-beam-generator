subtitle: Willow has a softer, more porous surface with prominent grain patterns than
  most softwoods. This requires lower laser power settings and careful beam scanning
  to avoid scorching the delicate fibers.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the willow surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, embedded within a matrix of aged, cross-linked organic residues. The underlying
    wood cell structure is partially masked, with contaminants filling the porous
    lumen of vessels and fibers. The surface texture appears uneven and occluded,
    disrupting the natural grain pattern.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the microscopic view reveals a complete restoration
    of the willow''s native surface topography. The contamination layer has been entirely
    removed, exposing the well-defined cellular structure of the wood. Vessel elements
    and fiber cells are now clearly visible, with their open lumens and distinct cell
    walls.


    The process has successfully ablated the foreign material without inducing thermal
    degradation to the underlying wood substrate, which has a pyrolysis temperature
    of 280°C. The laser''s precise energy delivery, calibrated below the 1.8 J/cm²
    ablation threshold of clean willow, selectively targeted the contaminants.


    The resulting surface exhibits the intrinsic porosity (approximately 65%) and
    grain pattern of the wood. This non-abrasive cleaning preserves the structural
    integrity of the delicate surface fibers, maintaining the material''s original
    mechanical and aesthetic properties for applications demanding precision.'
