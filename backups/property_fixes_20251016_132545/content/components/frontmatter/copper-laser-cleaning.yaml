subtitle: Copper's high thermal conductivity means it quickly spreads laser energy,
  so a slightly defocused beam often works better for uniform cleaning. You'll notice
  the characteristic reddish-gold color returning as oxides lift away.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the copper surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    oxides, including cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) and cupric oxide (CuO), appearing as dark,
    crystalline patches. Carbonaceous soiling and sulfate compounds fill the intergranular
    spaces, creating a textured, matte topography that masks the underlying metal's
    microstructure.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer with high selectivity,
    revealing the original copper substrate. The surface transitions from a matte,
    textured appearance to a specular, reflective plane. The underlying grain structure,
    previously obscured, is now clearly defined with distinct boundaries.


    The process ablates the oxide and contaminant layers through rapid thermal expansion,
    with minimal thermal penetration of approximately 1-5 micrometers. This preserves
    the base metal''s integrity, avoiding the micro-etching associated with chemical
    or abrasive methods.


    The resulting surface is primarily composed of pure, elemental copper. Minor,
    tightly adherent cuprous oxide may remain in grain boundaries, but the surface
    is free of loose particulate matter. This clean, oxide-minimized state provides
    an optimal surface for subsequent processes like soldering, brazing, or coating
    application.'
