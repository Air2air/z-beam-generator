caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the quartz glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from 1-20 µm in diameter, is
    embedded in a thin, amorphous film. This film, measuring approximately 0.5-2 µm
    thick, exhibits a mottled texture that scatters incident light, significantly
    reducing the substrate''s inherent 93% transmissivity.


    The contamination adheres tenaciously, filling the native micro-roughness of the
    glass. The pattern suggests a combination of handling residues, atmospheric dust
    deposition, and potential process-related spatter. This layer compromises the
    optical and surface properties, creating localized stress points and increasing
    the risk of laser-induced damage during subsequent high-power applications by
    lowering the effective ablation threshold.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals
    the pristine quartz substrate. The contamination layer has been completely removed
    via selective laser ablation, restoring the original surface micro-topography.
    The amorphous, light-scattering film is absent, and no particulate matter remains.


    The intrinsic transmissivity and laser damage threshold of the quartz are now
    fully restored. The surface exhibits no evidence of thermal stress, micro-fractures,
    or sub-surface damage, confirming the process operated well below the material''s
    2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. The cleaning has achieved atomic-level decontamination
    without compromising the bulk material properties.'
