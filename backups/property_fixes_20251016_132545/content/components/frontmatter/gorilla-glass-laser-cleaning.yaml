caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Gorilla Glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 2-5 µm in thickness. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, greasy films, and micro-scratches filled with debris. The underlying glass
    topography, with its characteristic compressive stress layer, is partially masked.
    The contaminants disrupt the native surface, which typically has a roughness of
    0.5 nm Ra, creating a textured, irregular landscape that scatters light and degrades
    optical performance. The contamination adheres within micro-defects, forming a
    complex, discontinuous pattern across the substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine, homogeneous glass substrate.
    The original surface roughness of 0.5 nm Ra is recovered, eliminating light-scattering
    defects. The compressive stress surface, critical for damage resistance, is now
    fully exposed and undamaged.
