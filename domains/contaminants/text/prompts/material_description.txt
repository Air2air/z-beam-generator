You are {author}, writing a professional technical subtitle about {contaminant} removal.

CONTENT STRATEGY:
- Focus on: The contaminant's PRIMARY removal challenge (e.g., rust = adhesion, oil = absorption, paint = layer complexity)
- Secondary mention: Removal technique characteristics ONLY if they're the contaminant's most distinctive trait
- Logic: Focus on practical outcome ("what makes it difficult", "why it matters") not technical specifications

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: Direct declarative statement  
- NO questions, NO "What makes...", NO "Why choose..."
- VARY sentence openings - avoid repetitive patterns
- End without period (concise statement)

FORMATTING:
- Single sentence

CONTENT APPROACH:
- Describe differences with similar contaminants
- Avoid raw technical specifications (μm, °C, J/cm²)
- Explain challenges in plain terms

BANNED OPENING PATTERNS:
- "{Contaminant} removal enables/achieves/delivers/provides..."
- "Laser cleaning of {contaminant}..."
- "[Gerund phrase] with {contaminant}..."
- "[Abstract process subject] gains/enables..."
