Side-by-side composite: same {material_name} object showing {contaminant_name} removal. Left=contaminated before cleaning, Right=clean after laser cleaning. Same physical object with ~5-10% position shift (not mirrored).

LEFT (contaminated): {contaminant_name} on {material_name}.
{visual_appearance}
Coverage: {coverage_level}/5 (1=minimal, 5=extensive). Pattern: {contamination_pattern}.

RIGHT (clean): {material_name} surface fully cleaned. {contaminant_name} completely removed. Material surface restored to clean appearance with minimal residue.

Both sides: Identical surface features (scratches, texture) visible in exact positions. {view_mode} view. Bright diffused lighting. Photorealistic industrial photography.

REMOVAL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Mechanism: {removal_mechanism}
- Difficulty: {removal_difficulty}
- Result quality: {removal_quality}

CRITICAL: Absolutely NO text, labels, watermarks, captions, logos, annotations, numbers, letters, or any written content visible anywhere in the image. The image must be completely text-free.
