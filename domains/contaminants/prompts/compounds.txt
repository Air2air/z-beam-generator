# Compound Composition Research Prompt

## Context
Generate chemical compound composition for {{contaminant_name}} contamination.

## Task
Research the primary chemical compounds that make up {{contaminant_name}}. Identify:

1. Primary compounds (3-5 most significant)
2. Secondary compounds (2-3 minor components)
3. Chemical formulas and CAS numbers
4. Typical concentrations/percentages

## Output Format
Provide a structured list:
```
Primary Compounds:
- [compound name] ([formula]) - [percentage/role]
- [compound name] ([formula]) - [percentage/role]

Secondary Compounds:
- [compound name] ([formula]) - [percentage/role]
```

## Requirements
- Research actual chemical composition
- Include CAS numbers where applicable
- Focus on compounds relevant to laser cleaning safety
- NO FALLBACKS - Research specific to this contamination
