💡 REMEMBER: Every sentence should help someone WORK WITH this material, not just know about it.

🚫 AVOID EXCESSIVE TECHNICAL JARGON:
- NO multiple decimal places in one sentence (0.95, 0.06, 933.47)
- NO wavelength citations without context ("at 1064 nm")
- NO physics textbook language ("presents a primary challenge")
- NO temperature in Kelvin (use °C or descriptive terms)
- NO property bombardment (listing specs without practical use)
- YES practical guidance: "Start with lower power to avoid..."
- YES conversational technical: Expert explaining, not documenting
