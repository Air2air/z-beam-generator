# AUTHOR VOICE ARCHITECTURE (Dec 6, 2025)
# =============================================================================
# Voice control is handled ONLY by persona files (shared/prompts/personas/*.yaml)
# Author assignment happens ONCE per material and NEVER changes thereafter
# All voice characteristics (tone, style, phrases) come from assigned author persona
# Domain config should contain ZERO voice/content instructions
# See: Content Instruction Policy, Author Assignment Immutability Policy

# =============================================================================
# STRUCTURAL VARIATION (Per-Generation Randomization)
# =============================================================================
# Humanness optimizer randomizes STRUCTURE and RHYTHM (not voice/tone)
# These settings provide variation without changing author voice
randomization_targets:
  # NOTE: 'voices' section REMOVED - persona files control ALL voice behavior
  # Author voice is immutable after initial assignment
  # Rhythm patterns provide structural variation without content instruction
  rhythms:
    short_punchy:
      label: "SHORT & PUNCHY"
      description: "Use mostly 5-10 word sentences. Rapid fire. Direct impact. Build momentum."
      sentence_range: [5, 10]
      probability: 0.33
    mixed_cadence:
      label: "MIXED CADENCE"
      description: "Alternate short (5-10 word) and long (20-30 word) sentences for natural rhythm."
      short_range: [5, 10]
      long_range: [20, 30]
      probability: 0.33
    complex_compound:
      label: "COMPLEX COMPOUND"
      description: "Use longer, detailed sentences (15-30 words) with clauses and technical depth."
      sentence_range: [15, 30]
      probability: 0.34

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT TEMPLATES
# =============================================================================
# All prompt templates moved to domains/settings/prompts/*.txt files
# This maintains separation: configs = system behavior, prompts = content instructions
# See docs/08-development/WORD_COUNT_IN_PROMPTS_POLICY.md

# Legacy prompts section removed (Dec 29, 2025)
# Prompt files available:
#   - component_summary.txt (individual component descriptions)
#   - recommendations.txt (settings recommendations)
#   - description.txt, excerpt.txt, challenges.txt, etc.

# prompts_deprecated: Removed Dec 29, 2025 - All prompts in domains/settings/prompts/*.txt
