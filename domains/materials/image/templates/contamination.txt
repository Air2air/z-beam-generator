Side-by-side composite: same {MATERIAL} {COMMON_OBJECT} in {ENVIRONMENT}. Left=contaminated before cleaning, Right=clean after laser cleaning. Same physical object with ~5-10% position shift (not mirrored).

LEFT (contaminated): {CONTAMINANTS_SECTION}
Coverage: {CONTAMINATION_LEVEL}/5 (1=10-20%, 5=85-100%). Uniformity: {UNIFORMITY}/5 (1=single type, 5=4+ types).

RIGHT (clean): Full {MATERIAL} color/sheen restored. Minimal residue. Aging effects (oxidation, UV damage, discoloration) MITIGATED by laser cleaning - surface appears refreshed with improved appearance, though material-appropriate permanent damage may remain (metals: deep pitting/corrosion cavities; ceramics: cracks/chips; polymers: delamination/fiber exposure; wood: rot/splits).

Both sides: Identical light scratches/dents in exact positions (visible through dirt on left). {VIEW_MODE} view. Environment wear: {ENVIRONMENT_WEAR}/5. Bright diffused lighting. Photorealistic.

CRITICAL: Absolutely NO text, labels, watermarks, captions, logos, annotations, numbers, letters, or any written content visible anywhere in the image. The image must be completely text-free.
