## 🔬 Core Philosophy

### **Aging = Contamination**

Traditional systems focused on:
- Dirt, oils, deposits, stains (removable contamination)

New system recognizes:
- **Aging effects ARE contamination** for laser cleaning applications
- UV damage, oxidation, biodegradation, hydrolysis, embrittlement
- Material structure breakdown requiring laser restoration

### **Material-Specific Priorities**

| Material Category | Priority Balance |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Organics** (wood, natural fibers) | 70% aging, 30% deposits |
| **Metals** | 50% corrosion/oxidation, 50% deposits |
| **Polymers** | 60% UV/chemical aging, 40% contamination |
| **Ceramics** | 50% weathering/erosion, 50% deposits |
| **Composites** | 55% matrix degradation, 45% surface contamination |

## 🧬 Material-Specific Aging Patterns

### **Wood (Hardwood, Softwood, Engineered)**

**Primary Aging Concerns**:
1. **UV Photodegradation** (most visible)
   - Lignin breakdown: color shift white/cream → gray → silver-gray
   - Cellulose exposure: surface roughening, fiber raising
   - Distribution: UV-facing surfaces, gradient from exposed to shaded
   - Timeline: Visible in weeks (color), months (texture)

2. **Moisture-Induced Degradation**
   - Grain raising, checking, cracking along grain
   - Fungal discoloration (blue stain, brown rot indicators)
   - Water staining: dark streaks following grain

- Knot interactions: Different aging around knots (resin protection or weakness)
- Growth ring visibility: Enhanced or obscured by aging

---

### **Metals (Ferrous, Non-Ferrous, Reactive)**

**Primary Aging Concerns**:
1. **Oxidation/Corrosion** (aging as contamination)
   - Iron: Red-brown rust, stratified layers, pitting
   - Copper: Green verdigris, brown cuprite, black patina progression
   - Aluminum: White powdery oxide, pitting corrosion
   - Steel: Surface rust → scale → pitting → structural loss

2. **Galvanic Corrosion** (multi-metal aging)
   - Concentrated at dissimilar metal junctions
   - Electrolyte-dependent patterns (salt spray accelerates)

3. **Stress Corrosion**
   - Cracking at stress concentration points
   - Weld zone corrosion
   - Bend radius accelerated oxidation

**Distribution Reality**:
- Gravity drips: Rust staining below fasteners, joints
- Crevice corrosion: Enhanced at overlaps, gasket interfaces
- Galvanic cells: More severe near dissimilar metals
- Edge concentration: Higher corrosion at cut edges, corners

---

### **Polymers (Thermoplastics, Elastomers, Engineering)**

   - Surface roughening from rain, wind, freeze-thaw
   - Efflorescence: White salt deposits from moisture migration
   - Spalling: Surface layer loss from freeze-thaw

2. **Biological Growth**
   - Algae, lichen, moss on moist surfaces

## 🔍 Distribution Physics Realism

### **Gravity-Driven Patterns**

**Drips & Runs**:
```
High concentration at top
    ↓
Vertical streaks following gravity
    ↓
Accumulation at bottom edge
```

**Pooling**:
- Horizontal surfaces: Uniform coating or evaporation rings
- Depressions: Concentrated contamination/aging
- Edges: Drip lines, overflow patterns

### **Environmental Exposure Gradients**

**UV Exposure**:
```
Direct sun → Most severe aging
Indirect light → Moderate aging
Shaded → Minimal UV aging (but may have moisture issues)
```

**Moisture Exposure**:
```
Constantly wet → Biological growth, hydrolysis
Wet-dry cycling → Most damaging (expansion/contraction)
Always dry → Minimal moisture damage (but UV/oxidation continues)
```

### **Substrate Structure Effects**

**Grain Following** (wood):
- Weathering follows grain orientation
- Cracks form along grain boundaries
- Staining penetrates deeper in end grain

**Stress Concentration** (all materials):
- Cracks initiate at high-stress points
- Bends, holes, notches show accelerated aging
- Weld/joint zones have different corrosion

**Porosity Effects** (porous materials):
- Contamination penetrates deeper in porous zones
- Staining spreads via capillary action
- Drying patterns leave concentration rings

## 📸 Photo-Realism Requirements

### **Observable Characteristics**

Every pattern description must reference:
1. **Macro-scale appearance** (what you see from 1 meter)
2. **Micro-scale details** (what close-up reveals)
3. **Lighting interaction** (how light reveals or hides features)
4. **Temporal progression** (how appearance changes over time)

### **Real-World Documentation Sources**

- Conservation reports (museum, architectural preservation)
- Material science accelerated aging studies
- Industrial cleaning before/after documentation
- Outdoor exposure trial results
- Corrosion atlas photographs
- Weathering research publications

### **Prohibited Idealization**

❌ **Avoid**:
- Perfectly uniform coatings where gravity should create variation
- Symmetric patterns in asymmetric environments
- Instant aging (show gradual progression)
- Single-color oxidation (real corrosion has color gradients)
- Smooth boundaries (real aging has irregular edges)

✅ **Include**:
- Gravity drips, runs, accumulation
- UV gradient from exposed to shaded
- Stress concentration at corners, edges, fasteners
- Grain/structure following in distribution
- Color gradients in oxidation/degradation
- Irregular boundaries and feathered edges

## 🧪 Synergistic Effects

### **Aging + Contamination Interactions**

1. **UV + Moisture** (most damaging to organics)
   - UV breaks down surface → moisture penetrates deeper
   - Wet-dry cycling with UV: maximum degradation rate

2. **Oil + Heat** (polymers, metals)
   - Thermal oxidation of oil creates thick deposits
   - Oil traps heat, accelerating underlying material aging

3. **Biological + Chemical** (ceramics, wood)
   - Organism byproducts etch surfaces
   - Root penetration creates moisture pathways

4. **Salt + UV** (metals, polymers)
   - Salt accelerates corrosion
   - UV + salt spray: extreme degradation

### **Protective Interactions**

1. **Patina Formation** (copper, bronze)
   - Initial corrosion protects from further degradation
   - Stable oxide layer slows continued aging

2. **Surface Hardening** (some polymers)
   - UV-induced cross-linking creates protective skin
   - Prevents deeper penetration (but surface becomes brittle)

## 🎨 Implementation in Image Generation

### **Pattern Selection Strategy**

For each material, select 3-5 patterns with:
- **At least 2 aging patterns** (UV, oxidation, biodegradation, etc.)
- **1-2 traditional contamination** (oils, deposits, stains)
- **Optional: 1 combined pattern** (aging + contamination synergy)

### **Weighting by Material Type**

**Organic Materials** (wood, natural fibers):
```
Aging patterns: 70% weight
- UV photodegradation (primary)
- Moisture damage
- Biological decay

Traditional contamination: 30% weight
- Dirt accumulation
- Staining
```

**Metals**:
```
Aging patterns: 50% weight

```

**Polymers**:
```
