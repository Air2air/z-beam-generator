# Metal-Specific Corrections

## CRITICAL: CONTAMINATION MUST NOT BE UNIFORM
- NEVER show even/uniform contamination coverage - looks artificial
- Contamination must vary: heavier in crevices, lighter on high points
- Real contamination shows natural accumulation patterns NOT even coating
- Include VARIATION: thick spots, thin areas, gradients across surface

## CONTAMINATION DISTRIBUTION RULES
- Welding spatter: RANDOM scattered spots, varying sizes
- Scale deposits: PATCHY, heavier on edges and water contact areas
- Rust/oxidation: Concentrates in low spots, spreads from scratches/damage
- Oil residue: Pools in low areas, streaks where wiped or gravity pulled

## COATED METALS (TiN, TiCN, Diamond-like)
- Base coating color (gold/bronze for TiN) visible through thin contamination
- Thick deposits obscure coating, thin areas show underlying color
- Contamination sits ON coating surface, not absorbed into it
- Wear areas may show coating wearing through to base metal

## TOOLS AND MACHINERY
- Contamination heavier on working surfaces (cutting edges, contact points)
- Handle/grip areas show different wear than working surfaces
- Drill bits: flutes and tip most contaminated, shaft cleaner
- Natural use patterns dictate where contamination accumulates

## AFTER-CLEANING APPEARANCE
- Base metal/coating visible with realistic wear and tool marks
- NOT mirror-perfect or factory-new appearance
- Shows history: machining lines, minor scratches, handling wear
- Normal wear marks (scratches, handling, tool marks) for authenticity - NO residual contamination
