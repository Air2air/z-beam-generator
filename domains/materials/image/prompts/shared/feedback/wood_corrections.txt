# Wood-Specific Corrections

## WOOD TEXTURE (CRITICAL - BOTH SIDES)
Wood MUST be RAW and COMPLETELY UNFINISHED on BOTH sides:
- NO polish, NO sheen, NO gloss, NO varnish, NO lacquer finish
- Show PALE, ROUGH, MATTE grain with visible wood fibers
- Natural open pores visible in the wood surface
- If wood looks "finished" or "polished" = WRONG

## MANDATORY LEFT SIDE CONTAMINATION (CRITICAL)
LEFT SIDE MUST show WEATHERED, AGED appearance - NOT pristine:
- Weathered gray patina and dark water stain discoloration
- Gray-silver aging like OLD DECK BOARDS left outside for years
- Staining SOAKED DEEP INTO the wood grain (not sitting on top)
- Gray/brown weathering following the natural wood grain pattern
- Color shift: Natural blonde/tan → gray/brown/silver throughout
- Coverage: 50-70% of surface showing age/weathering/contamination
- If left side looks "clean" or "new" = WRONG

## RIGHT SIDE (AFTER CLEANING)
- Show the SAME wood restored to natural pale color
- RAW unfinished texture (still rough, just clean)
- Clean grain visible, no dark staining
- Dramatic visual difference from left side

ROTATION: Right side rotated 10-20° from left - different face visible.
