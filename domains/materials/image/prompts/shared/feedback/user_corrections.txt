USER FEEDBACK:
- LEFT: Front view only. Dirty with flat stains.
- RIGHT ONLY: Rotated 15-25° horizontal + different distance. Clean with wear.
- Clean side = scratches, tool marks, worn edges.
- CAMERA: Flat perspective, telephoto compression. Minimal depth distortion. Edges stay parallel (near-orthographic).
