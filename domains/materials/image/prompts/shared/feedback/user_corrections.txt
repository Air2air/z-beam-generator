# Core Quality Rules (condensed ~1000 chars)

## ABSOLUTE CRITICAL - BEFORE/AFTER CONTRAST
- LEFT (BEFORE): Must look DIRTY, STAINED, CONTAMINATED - visually obvious contamination
- RIGHT (AFTER): Must look CLEAN, RESTORED, PRISTINE - dramatic improvement visible
- NEVER make left and right look similar - they MUST be visually DIFFERENT
- LEFT must be MUCH DARKER than RIGHT - dramatic tonal difference required
- Viewer should INSTANTLY recognize: "dirty on left, clean on right"
- If both sides look the same brightness/color = WRONG

## CRITICAL - OBJECT ACCURACY
- Object: Use EXACT specified shape from --shape parameter
- "stairway railing" = handrail with balusters/spindles going UP STAIRS
- "deck boards" = horizontal planks, NOT a railing
- NO substituting different objects - must match user's specification exactly
- Rotation: RIGHT side rotated 10-20° horizontally from LEFT (different face visible).
- No Text: NO labels, words, watermarks anywhere.
- Same Object: BEFORE/AFTER show identical object, only contamination differs.

## HIGH PRIORITY
- Background: Match setting (workshop bench for tools, building exterior for architectural).
- Contamination Texture: THIN surface films, stains, dust ONLY - NEVER thick, chunky, caked, or painted-on deposits.
- NO 3D buildup - contamination is ALWAYS flat against surface, absorbed INTO material, not sitting ON TOP.
- NO oily or greasy-looking contamination - NEVER wet-looking, shiny slicks, or glossy residue that looks like oil/grease.
- NO surface dirt or dust - NEVER powdery deposits, loose particles, or dusty/dirty film sitting on surface.
- Contamination Coverage: CONSISTENT coverage across surface - NOT splotchy, random patches, or polka-dot patterns.
- Real contamination spreads evenly with gradual gradients, not isolated spots scattered randomly.
- After Residual: 90-95% clean with 5-10% traces in crevices/pores.
