# Material Image Quality Corrections
# Updated: 2025-11-25
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS: Add your feedback here after reviewing generated images.
# This file is automatically included in BOTH generation and validation prompts.
#
# 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: FEEDBACK MUST BE GENERAL OR CATEGORY-LEVEL ONLY
# ❌ NEVER material-specific ("Birch must show...", "Steel needs...")
# ✅ ALWAYS general ("Wood surfaces must...", "Metal oxidation should...")
# ✅ OR category-specific ("Rust on metals...", "Grain patterns in wood...")
#
# WHY: Feedback applies to ALL future materials in that category automatically.
#      Material-specific feedback creates inconsistency across similar materials.
# 
# FORMAT:
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ## [Category/Pattern Name] (Updated: YYYY-MM-DD)
# ISSUE: [Describe what's wrong with the output]
# FIX: "[Exact instruction to add to prompts]"
# PRIORITY: [CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM]
# APPLIES TO: [Category or pattern type]
# EXAMPLES: [Image IDs showing the issue]
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# PRIORITY LEVELS:
# - CRITICAL: Must fix immediately (blocking issue)
# - HIGH: Should fix soon (quality impact)
# - MEDIUM: Nice to have (minor improvement)
#
# CORRECT EXAMPLES:
# ✅ "Wood surfaces: Grain patterns must follow material structure"
# ✅ "Rust patterns: Must show gravity effects with vertical drips"
# ✅ "All materials: Edge contamination 60-75% heavier than center"
#
# INCORRECT EXAMPLES:
# ❌ "Birch wood: Must show horizontal lenticels" (too specific)
# ❌ "Steel oxidation needs darker patches" (material-specific)
# ❌ "Fix Aluminum reflections" (singles out one material)

## Object Realism (Updated: 2025-11-25)
ISSUE: Generated images show composite/artificial objects instead of realistic single objects
FIX: "BEFORE/AFTER must show the SAME REAL OBJECT, not a composite. Use authentic industrial/commercial objects (panels, tools, parts, furniture). Maintain EXACT object continuity - same item, same angle, only contamination differs. NO artificial composites or merged objects."
PRIORITY: CRITICAL
APPLIES TO: All materials
EXAMPLES: Birch image showed unrealistic composite instead of real wood object

## Contamination Appropriateness (Updated: 2025-11-25)
ISSUE: Inappropriate contaminants appearing (dirt, oil, dry grass on materials where they don't belong)
FIX: "Match contaminants to material category and typical environment. Wood: dust, mold, water stains, UV damage. Metals: rust/oxidation, industrial oils, metal particles. NO generic 'dirt', NO dry grass on indoor materials, NO inappropriate organic matter. Research-based contamination patterns ONLY."
PRIORITY: HIGH
APPLIES TO: All categories
EXAMPLES: Multiple materials showing dirt/grass instead of material-specific contamination

## Rust Visibility and Contrast (Updated: 2025-11-25)
ISSUE: Rust patterns don't show clear before/after transformation
FIX: "Rust patterns: BEFORE side must show VISIBLE rust accumulation (orange-brown oxidation, surface texture changes, 40-60% coverage in affected areas). AFTER side shows CLEAN base metal color. Contrast must be dramatic and obvious. NO subtle rust, NO barely-visible contamination."
PRIORITY: CRITICAL
APPLIES TO: metals_ferrous, metals_reactive
EXAMPLES: Rust not clearly visible in before/after comparison
