# Critical Quality Corrections (Auto-applied to generation)

## Object Realism - CRITICAL
BEFORE/AFTER must show SAME REAL OBJECT, not composite. Use authentic industrial/commercial objects (panels, tools, parts, furniture). Maintain EXACT object continuity - same item, same angle, only contamination differs.

## Contamination Matching - HIGH
Match contaminants to material category. Wood: dust, mold, water stains, UV damage. Metals: rust/oxidation, industrial oils, metal particles. NO generic dirt, NO grass on indoor materials. Research-based patterns ONLY.

## Rust Visibility - CRITICAL
Rust BEFORE: VISIBLE accumulation (orange-brown oxidation, texture changes, 40-60% coverage). AFTER: CLEAN base metal. Contrast must be dramatic. NO subtle rust.

## Position Shift - HIGH
Maintain 5-10% position shift between sides. Prevents mirror effect. Same object, slightly different angle/position.

## NO TEXT/LABELS - CRITICAL
ABSOLUTELY NO text, labels, captions, words, letters, numbers, typography, signage, markings, annotations, watermarks, logos, "before", "after", or ANY written characters. Pure photographic content ONLY.
