# Critical Quality Corrections (Auto-applied to generation)

## Object Shape - CRITICAL
Object MUST be the exact shape specified (ingot, sheet, wire, etc.). Do NOT substitute with crystals, random forms, or generic objects. The specified shape is mandatory and non-negotiable.

## Object Realism - CRITICAL
BEFORE/AFTER must show SAME REAL OBJECT, not composite. Use authentic industrial/commercial objects (panels, tools, parts, furniture). Maintain EXACT object continuity - same item, same angle, only contamination differs.

## Horizontal Rotation Between Sides - CRITICAL (MOST IMPORTANT)
The RIGHT side MUST be rotated 10-20 degrees HORIZONTALLY (left-right rotation) from the LEFT side. This is rotation around the vertical axis ONLY - do NOT tilt up or down. You MUST see a different face/angle of the object on the right. Left shows one angle, right shows a DIFFERENT horizontal angle of the SAME object. This horizontal rotation is MANDATORY - identical angles are UNACCEPTABLE.

## Background/Setting - HIGH
Background MUST match the setting context. For workshop items: workshop bench, workbench, or industrial work surface. For architectural/structural items: show in installed location (building exterior, construction site, etc.). NO studio backdrops, NO white backgrounds, NO abstract settings. Setting must be realistic and appropriate for the object type.

## Contamination Matching - HIGH
Match contaminants to material category. Wood: dust, mold, water stains, UV damage. Metals: rust/oxidation, industrial oils, metal particles. NO generic dirt, NO grass on indoor materials. Research-based patterns ONLY.

## Rust Visibility - HIGH
Rust BEFORE: VISIBLE accumulation (orange-brown oxidation, texture changes, 40-80% coverage in affected areas). AFTER: CLEAN base metal. Contrast must be dramatic.

## No Text/Labels - CRITICAL
Absolutely NO text, labels, words, "before", "after", watermarks, or any written characters anywhere in the image.
