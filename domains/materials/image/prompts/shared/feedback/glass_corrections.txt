# Glass-Specific Corrections

## CONTAMINATION TEXTURE FOR GLASS
- Glass contamination must be THIN, UNIFORM films - NOT chunky, thick, or caked deposits
- Contamination on glass appears as: haze, film, streaks, water spots, mineral deposits
- NEVER show thick buildup or 3D deposits on glass surfaces
- Glass contamination is typically: dried residue, thin staining, surface haze
- Contamination should look like it could be wiped off, not scraped off

## GLASS-SPECIFIC CONTAMINATION TYPES
- Water spots: thin mineral rings, not thick crusty deposits
- Biological films: thin green/brown haze, not chunky growth
- Chemical residue: uniform haze or streaking, not blotchy patches
- Oil/grease: thin smears and fingerprints, not thick coatings

## CLEAN GLASS APPEARANCE
- Clean glass should be transparent/clear but show realistic age
- Minor scratches, surface wear, and slight haziness are realistic
- Should NOT look like brand-new factory glass
- Clean means "free of contamination" not "perfectly new"

## PHYSICS OF GLASS CONTAMINATION
- Glass is non-porous - contamination sits ON surface, not absorbed INTO it
- Contamination spreads in thin layers following gravity and water flow
- Edges and corners may show slightly more accumulation
- Vertical surfaces show downward streaking patterns
