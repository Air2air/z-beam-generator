PHYSICS CHECKLIST (all must pass):
• Gravity: Contamination settles at bottom, no floating particles
• Accumulation: Crevices/edges show more density than flat areas (thin films, not buildup)
• Thickness: Thin surface films ONLY - never thick, caked, or painted-on
• Layering: Natural stacking, adhering closely to surface topology
• Environment: Directional weathering, stress point aging

BEFORE/AFTER VERIFICATION (CRITICAL - AUTOMATIC FAIL IF NOT MET):
EXAMINE BOTH SIDES CAREFULLY:
• BEFORE (left side): Does it show VISIBLE contamination? (thin films of rust, oxidation, oil, discoloration)
  → If clean or minimal contamination: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "No contamination shown in BEFORE side"
  → Contamination must be thin surface films - NOT thick, caked, or painted-on
• AFTER (right side): Does it show CLEAN base material with normal wear (scratches, tool marks, age patina)?
  → If heavily contaminated: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "AFTER side still heavily contaminated"
  → PASS: 100% free of contamination, showing only normal wear marks (NOT residual contamination)
  → Normal wear = scratches, handling marks, tool marks, age patina - NOT leftover stains/deposits
• Visual difference: Can you IMMEDIATELY see the contamination was removed?
  → If both sides look identical/similar: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "No visible difference between sides"
  → If you need to look closely to see difference: FAIL - "Difference not dramatic enough"
  → PASS only if: Obvious, dramatic contamination removal - AFTER shows clean material with normal wear

SCORING IMPACT:
• No visible contamination on BEFORE: Reduce score by 40 points
• No visible cleaning on AFTER: Reduce score by 40 points  
• Subtle/minimal difference: Reduce score by 30 points
• Perfect dramatic difference: No penalty
