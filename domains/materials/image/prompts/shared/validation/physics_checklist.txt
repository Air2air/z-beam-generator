PHYSICS CHECKLIST (all must pass):
• Gravity: Drips flow down, pool at bottom, vertical runs
• Accumulation: Crevices/edges 50-75% heavier than flat areas
• Thickness: Thin→thick gradient, not uniform coating
• Layering: Natural stacking, not "painted on"
• Environment: Directional weathering, stress point aging

BEFORE/AFTER VERIFICATION (CRITICAL - AUTOMATIC FAIL IF NOT MET):
EXAMINE BOTH SIDES CAREFULLY:
• BEFORE (left side): Does it show VISIBLE contamination? (rust, dirt, oil, discoloration)
  → If clean or minimal contamination: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "No contamination shown in BEFORE side"
• AFTER (right side): Does it show CLEAN base material?
  → If still contaminated: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "AFTER side still contaminated"
• Visual difference: Can you IMMEDIATELY see the contamination was removed?
  → If both sides look identical/similar: AUTOMATIC FAIL - "No visible difference between sides"
  → If you need to look closely to see difference: FAIL - "Difference not dramatic enough"
  → PASS only if: Obvious, dramatic, impossible-to-miss contamination removal (40-80% cleaner)

SCORING IMPACT:
• No visible contamination on BEFORE: Reduce score by 40 points
• No visible cleaning on AFTER: Reduce score by 40 points  
• Subtle/minimal difference: Reduce score by 30 points
• Perfect dramatic difference: No penalty

Report violations as physics_issues or distribution_issues.
