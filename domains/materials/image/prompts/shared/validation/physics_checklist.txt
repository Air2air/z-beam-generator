PHYSICS CHECKLIST (all must pass):
• Gravity: Drips flow down, pool at bottom, vertical runs
• Accumulation: Crevices/edges 50-75% heavier than flat areas
• Thickness: Thin→thick gradient, not uniform coating
• Layering: Natural stacking, not "painted on"
• Environment: Directional weathering, stress point aging

Report violations as physics_issues.
