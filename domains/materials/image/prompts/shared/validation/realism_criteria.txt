VALIDATION SCORING RUBRIC:

OVERALL REALISM SCORE (0-100):

90-100: PHOTOREALISTIC
- All physics laws correctly applied
- Excellent micro-scale details visible
- Natural contamination patterns throughout
- Indistinguishable from real industrial photography
- Zero AI generation artifacts

75-89: GOOD REALISM
- Minor physics inconsistencies only
- Mostly authentic material appearance
- Natural distribution with small artificial elements
- Acceptable for most uses
- Minimal AI detection risk

60-74: ACCEPTABLE
- Noticeable artificial elements present
- Some physics violations visible
- Material appearance mostly correct
- Usable with disclaimer
- Moderate AI detection risk

40-59: POOR REALISM
- Significant quality issues
- Multiple physics violations
- Obvious artificial contamination patterns
- Not suitable for professional use
- High AI detection risk

0-39: FAILS VALIDATION
- Looks AI-generated
- Major physics violations throughout
- Contamination unrealistic
- Material appearance incorrect
- Reject and regenerate required

PASS THRESHOLD: 75/100 minimum required
