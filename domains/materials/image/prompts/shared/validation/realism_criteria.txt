REALISM SCORE (0-100):
• 90-100: Photorealistic, perfect physics, DRAMATIC before/after difference
• 75-89: Good, minor issues only (PASS) - clear contamination removal visible
• 60-74: Noticeable flaws, some physics violations, or weak before/after difference
• 40-59: Poor quality, multiple issues, or NO visible contamination difference
• 0-39: Fails validation, reject - identical sides or no contamination shown

PASS THRESHOLD: 75/100

CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
• If both sides look identical/very similar: MAX score 45/100 (automatic fail)
• If no contamination visible on BEFORE side: MAX score 50/100 (automatic fail)
• If AFTER side still heavily contaminated: MAX score 50/100 (automatic fail)
• If text/labels present: MAX score 70/100 (automatic fail)

The before/after difference must be IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS without close inspection.
