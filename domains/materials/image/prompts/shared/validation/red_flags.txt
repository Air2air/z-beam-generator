RED FLAGS (report if present):
🚩 Painted-on look (flat overlay, no depth)
🚩 Uniform coating (even thickness)
🚩 Physics violations (wrong gravity/flow)
🚩 Perfect symmetry (geometric patterns)
🚩 Sharp edges (digital cutoff)
🚩 Too pristine (no base aging)
🚩 Scale errors (wrong size for distance)
🚩 MINOR: Visible text/labels ON THE OBJECT (ignore background text, volume markings on glassware, or incidental markings)
🚩 CRITICAL: Generic oil/grease on materials that don't match researched contamination patterns
🚩 CRITICAL: Identical position/angle between before/after (object must show 5-10% shift as though handled)
🚩 CRITICAL: No visible contamination difference - both sides look similar/same (before MUST be contaminated, after MUST be clean)
🚩 CRITICAL: Both sides contaminated or both sides clean (defeats purpose of before/after comparison)

3+ flags = significant issues, 5+ = reject
Note: Text on object = deduct points but NOT automatic reject (false positives common)
Note: Generic oil on inappropriate materials (wood, ceramics, non-machinery metals) = automatic reject
Note: Identical positioning = automatic reject (object must show evidence of handling)
Note: No visible before/after difference = automatic reject (contamination removal must be dramatic)
