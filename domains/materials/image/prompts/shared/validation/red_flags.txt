REALISM RED FLAGS (AI Generation Mistakes):

Check for EACH red flag - presence indicates AI generation failure:

🚩 PAINTED-ON APPEARANCE:
   - Contamination looks like digital overlay
   - Flat coating ignoring material structure
   - No depth or three-dimensionality
   - Uniform application across surface

🚩 UNIFORM COATING:
   - Even thickness throughout
   - Consistent contamination density
   - Powder-like perfect application
   - Symmetric patterns/distribution

🚩 FLOATING PARTICLES:
   - Contamination defying gravity
   - Particles suspended in air
   - Upward flow on vertical surfaces
   - Equal top and bottom contamination

🚩 PERFECT SYMMETRY:
   - Mirror-image contamination patterns
   - Geometric shapes in buildup
   - Artificial pattern regularity
   - Non-organic distribution

🚩 DIGITAL OVERLAY LOOK:
   - Sharp boundary edges
   - Clean cutoff lines
   - Layer masking appearance
   - No feathering at transitions

🚩 IMPOSSIBLE CLEANLINESS:
   - Clean side looks brand new
   - Zero base oxidation/aging
   - Perfectly pristine material
   - No natural weathering (5-10% required)

🚩 SCALE INCONSISTENCIES:
   - Particles wrong size for scale
   - Microscopic details at macro view
   - Distance perspective violations
   - Contamination ignoring depth

🚩 TEMPORAL CONFLICTS:
   - Fresh contamination with old weathering
   - Conflicting aging timelines visible
   - Instant accumulation appearance
   - No gradual buildup evidence

🚩 WRONG PHYSICS:
   - Gravity violations (drips upward)
   - Impossible accumulation zones
   - Environmental logic failures
   - Material interaction errors

RED FLAG COUNT IMPACT:
- 0 red flags: Excellent realism
- 1-2 red flags: Minor issues, likely acceptable
- 3-4 red flags: Significant problems, borderline fail
- 5+ red flags: Clear AI generation, reject

Report all detected red flags in recommendations.
