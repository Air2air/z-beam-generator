CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS:
- NO text, labels, words, letters, numbers, captions, titles, annotations, watermarks, logos, signage, markings, "before", "after", or ANY written characters
- NO thick, chunky, caked, or painted-on contamination - must be THIN surface films only
- NO 3D buildup, blobs, globs, or deposits sitting ON TOP of surface - contamination is FLAT, absorbed INTO material
- NO gravity violations (contamination floating upward, defying physics)
- NO sharp boundaries (natural feathering only)
- NO perfectly clean AFTER side (must show 5-10% residual traces for realism)
- NO temporal conflicts (layering must be logical)
