CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS:
- NO text, labels, words, letters, numbers, captions, titles, annotations, watermarks, logos, signage, markings, "before", "after", or ANY written characters
- Thick, caked, or painted-on contamination (must be thin surface films with subtle depth)
- Gravity violations (contamination floating upward, defying physics)
- Heavy buildup or glob-like deposits (contamination must adhere closely to surface)
- Sharp boundaries (natural feathering only)
- Perfectly clean AFTER side (must show 5-10% residual traces for realism)
- Temporal conflicts (layering must be logical)
