AVOID (AI mistakes):
- Painted-on appearance (fake overlay, no 3D depth)
- Perfect geometric patterns/symmetry
- Gravity violations (horizontal drips, upward pooling)
- Scale inconsistencies (dust particles visible as individual spheres)
- Impossible cleanliness (no transition zones, binary clean/dirty)
- Uniform thickness (same coating everywhere)
- Sharp boundaries (contamination doesn't follow edges naturally)
- Temporal conflicts (fresh contamination under weathered layer)
