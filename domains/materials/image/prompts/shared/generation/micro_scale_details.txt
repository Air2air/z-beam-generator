MICRO-SCALE AUTHENTICITY:
- Surface topology: Contamination follows material contours (pores, scratches, grain)
- Porosity effects: Porous materials show absorption/staining vs surface coating
- Feathering: Natural gradients at boundaries (no sharp edges except recent deposits)
- Material interaction: Metal oxidation beneath dust, wood grain visible through film
- Lighting response: Contamination alters reflectivity (matte dust, glossy oil, textured rust)
