MICRO-SCALE AUTHENTICITY:

1. SURFACE TOPOLOGY FOLLOWING:
   - Contamination conforms to material grain structure
   - Texture variations affect contamination distribution
   - Surface roughness creates micro-pooling zones
   - Smooth areas show thinner, more uniform layers

2. POROSITY EFFECTS:
   - Porous materials (concrete, wood): Deep penetration visible
   - Non-porous materials (metal, glass): Surface accumulation only
   - Pore size affects contamination particle retention
   - Capillary action in porous zones creates concentration

3. FEATHERING AND TRANSITIONS:
   - Contamination edges show feathering (not sharp cutoffs)
   - Gradual density transitions at boundaries
   - Undercutting at edges from environmental exposure
   - Natural fading at contamination periphery

4. MATERIAL INTERACTION SPECIFICS:
   - Metal oxidation: Follows crystal structure, grain boundaries
   - Concrete: Efflorescence patterns, calcium deposits at pores
   - Wood: Dust follows grain direction, accumulates in checks
   - Glass: Water spotting, mineral deposits at edges

5. LIGHTING RESPONSE:
   - Contamination ABSORBS light (darker appearance)
   - Clean material REFLECTS light (shows true color/sheen)
   - Thickness affects transparency/translucency
   - Surface texture affects highlight patterns
