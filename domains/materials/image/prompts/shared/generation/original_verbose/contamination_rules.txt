CONTAMINATION DISTRIBUTION RULES:

1. UNEVEN APPLICATION (MANDATORY):
   - NO uniform coating thickness
   - Natural randomness in coverage patterns
   - Heavier in protected/sheltered areas
   - Lighter on exposed/weathered surfaces

2. EDGE CONCENTRATION:
   - Edge areas 60-75% heavier than center zones
   - Fasteners, seams, joints show visible accumulation
   - Boundary transitions create concentration gradients
   - Interface zones (material changes) attract contamination

3. GRAIN FOLLOWING:
   - Contamination follows material surface topology
   - Settles into grain valleys, texture channels
   - NOT uniform overlay ignoring surface structure
   - Material porosity affects penetration depth

4. STRESS POINT ACCUMULATION:
   - Damaged areas (scratches, dents) attract more contamination
   - Worn surfaces show accelerated buildup
   - Stress cracks become contamination channels
   - Bent/deformed areas concentrate aging effects

5. LAYERING VISIBILITY:
   - Multiple contamination types stack naturally
   - Layer boundaries visible (temporal sequence evident)
   - Base contamination visible through newer layers
   - Stratification shows environmental history
