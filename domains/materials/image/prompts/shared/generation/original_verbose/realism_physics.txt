REALISM PHYSICS (CRITICAL - Non-negotiable physical laws):

1. GRAVITY EFFECTS:
   - Drips flow DOWNWARD on vertical surfaces (3-5 visible drip patterns required)
   - Pooling in LOW areas (bottom edges, horizontal surfaces)
   - Runs follow VERTICAL orientation (not horizontal)
   - Heavier contamination accumulates at BOTTOM due to settling

2. ACCUMULATION ZONES:
   - Crevices and JOINTS: 50-80% heavier contamination concentration
   - EDGES and seams: Capillary action causes 60-75% increased buildup
   - CORNERS: Multiple-surface convergence creates visible concentration
   - Horizontal SURFACES: Dust settling creates even layer

3. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE:
   - UV-facing surfaces: MORE oxidation, chalking, fading visible
   - SHADED areas: Moisture retention creates different contamination patterns
   - Weather-facing: Wind/rain creates directional accumulation patterns
   - Stress points: Cracks, bends show concentrated aging effects

4. THICKNESS VARIATION:
   - Transparent thin films (light contamination zones)
   - Translucent surface layers (moderate contamination)
   - Denser accumulation in crevices (heavier zones - NOT thick/caked)
   - Gradual TRANSITIONS between zones (not sharp boundaries)
   - ALL contamination adheres closely to surface - NEVER thick, painted-on, or globby

5. NATURAL LAYERING:
   - Temporal SEQUENCE: Base corrosion → Dust accumulation → Weathering effects
   - Older layers positioned UNDER newer layers (natural stratigraphy)
   - Different contamination TYPES interact organically (overlap, blend)
   - NO "painted on" appearance (must show organic accumulation process)
