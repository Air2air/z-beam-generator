FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (AVOID - These indicate AI generation failures):

1. PAINTED-ON APPEARANCE:
   - NO uniform coating that ignores material structure
   - AVOID flat overlay appearance
   - REJECT digital layer look (contamination must be organic)

2. PERFECT GEOMETRIC PATTERNS:
   - NO symmetric contamination distribution
   - AVOID uniform edges/boundaries
   - REJECT artificial geometric shapes in buildup

3. GRAVITY VIOLATIONS:
   - NO floating particles defying gravity
   - NO upward contamination flow on vertical surfaces
   - NO equal contamination on top and bottom surfaces

4. SCALE INCONSISTENCIES:
   - NO microscopic contamination at macro scale
   - AVOID particles too large/small for the view
   - REJECT contamination ignoring distance perspective

5. IMPOSSIBLE CLEANLINESS:
   - NO brand-new appearance on clean side
   - AVOID zero base oxidation/aging (must show material age)
   - REJECT perfectly pristine material (maintain 5-10% base weathering)

6. UNIFORM COATING:
   - NO even thickness across entire surface
   - AVOID consistent contamination density
   - REJECT powder-like uniform application

7. SHARP BOUNDARIES:
   - NO hard edges at contamination transitions
   - AVOID clean cutoff lines
   - REJECT digital masking appearance

8. TEMPORAL IMPOSSIBILITIES:
   - NO fresh contamination with old weathering
   - AVOID conflicting aging timelines
   - REJECT instant accumulation appearance (must show gradual buildup)
