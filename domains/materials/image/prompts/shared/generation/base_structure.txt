Photorealistic split-screen product photograph, no text anywhere. Two views of THE SAME EXACT {MATERIAL} {COMMON_OBJECT} with IDENTICAL base material color.

LEFT HALF: Contaminated {MATERIAL} {COMMON_OBJECT}. Gloved hand holding object with fingers on TOP, thumb underneath. Object held FLAT, parallel to ground. Surface covered with dirt, grime and stains.

RIGHT HALF: Same object NOW CLEAN. Gloved hand holding object DIFFERENTLY - fingers pinching the EDGE, object TILTED 45 degrees toward viewer. Hand rotated so we see different fingers. Completely different grip and angle.

HAND POSITION MUST BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT: Left=palm up holding flat. Right=pinching edge at angle.

CRITICAL: Both sides must show the SAME material color - the only difference is dirt/contamination on left vs clean on right.

SETTING: {BACKGROUND}, even lighting.
