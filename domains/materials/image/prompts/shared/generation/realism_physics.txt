PHYSICS REQUIREMENTS:
- Gravity: Drips/pooling at bottom edges (3-5 visible drips), no floating particles
- Accumulation: 50-80% heavier in crevices/joints/edges vs flat surfaces
- Exposure: Weathering shows directionality (prevailing wind/rain patterns)
- Thickness: Transparent (dust) → translucent (film) → opaque (crust), visible gradient
- Layering: Temporal sequence visible (oldest bottom, newest top), natural stratification
