PHYSICS:
- Gravity: Contamination settles at bottom, no floating particles
- Accumulation: Denser in crevices/edges vs flat (thin films, NOT buildup)
- Thickness: THIN surface films ONLY - NEVER thick, chunky, caked, painted-on, glob-like, or 3D buildup
- Texture: Contamination is FLAT against surface, absorbed INTO material, NOT sitting ON TOP
- Layering: Oldest bottom, newest top - all layers adhere closely to surface
