PHYSICS:
- Gravity: Contamination settles at bottom, no floating particles
- Accumulation: Denser in crevices/edges vs flat (thin films, NOT buildup)
- Thickness: Thin surface films ONLY - never thick, caked, painted-on, or glob-like
- Layering: Oldest bottom, newest top - all layers adhere closely to surface
