SPLIT-SCREEN COMPOSITE IMAGE: Two photos side-by-side divided by vertical line down the center.

LEFT SIDE (before): Dirty contaminated {MATERIAL} {COMMON_OBJECT}
RIGHT SIDE (after): Same {COMMON_OBJECT} now clean from laser cleaning

CRITICAL: Image must have clear vertical split line dividing it exactly 50/50.
Format: 16:9 aspect ratio with two distinct halves showing same object.

## Material Research (Use Provided Data)

**Material**: {MATERIAL}
**Common Object**: {COMMON_OBJECT}
**Environment**: {ENVIRONMENT}
**Contaminants**: [Research data will be inserted here]

## Configuration
- **Contamination Level**: {CONTAMINATION_LEVEL}/5 (coverage intensity)
- **Uniformity**: {UNIFORMITY}/5 (number of contaminant types)
- **View Mode**: {VIEW_MODE}
- **Environment Wear**: {ENVIRONMENT_WEAR}/5

## SPLIT-SCREEN LAYOUT (CRITICAL)

**Format**: 16:9 aspect ratio, divided vertically down the center

**LEFT SIDE (BEFORE - Contaminated)**:
- Shows {COMMON_OBJECT} made from {MATERIAL}
- Covered with researched contaminants
- {CONTAMINATION_LEVEL}/5 coverage (10-100%)
- Darker appearance due to contamination
- Same object as right side, identical permanent features

**RIGHT SIDE (AFTER - Laser Cleaned)**:
- SAME {COMMON_OBJECT}, SAME permanent scratches/dents
- Most contamination removed by laser cleaning
- True {MATERIAL} color and texture visible
- Subtle position shift (~5-10%) for separate photo realism
- May have trace residue in deep crevices only

**VERTICAL SPLIT**: Clear division line down center. Two halves showing same object in different states.

## View Mode

**Contextual** (3D perspective in environment):
- {COMMON_OBJECT} in realistic {ENVIRONMENT}
- Close-up perspective with depth
- Natural lighting with shadows
- Subtle camera shift (~5-10%) between sides

**Isolated** (Technical 2D):
- Flat overhead view
- Plain neutral background  
- Even, shadowless lighting
- Identical positioning both sides

**Environment Wear** ({ENVIRONMENT_WEAR}/5): Background aging only, never affects object contamination.

## Contamination Levels

**Coverage** ({CONTAMINATION_LEVEL}/5):
- Level 1: 10-20%
- Level 2: 25-35%
- Level 3: 40-60%
- Level 4: 65-80%
- Level 5: 85-100%

**Variety** ({UNIFORMITY}/5):
- Number of different contaminant types from research
- Natural distribution patterns (pooling, streaking, oxidation)

## Material Specifications

**Base {MATERIAL}** (identical both sides):
- Authentic color, texture, sheen
- Permanent scratches, dents, wear marks (positioned identically)

**LEFT SIDE - Contaminated**:
- Base material visible through contamination
- Researched contaminants applied as overlay
- Heavier in crevices and edges
- Overall darker appearance

**CRITICAL CONTAMINATION REALISM REQUIREMENTS**:
- **NO uniform powder overlays** - they appear artificial and painted-on
- **Gravity-driven patterns REQUIRED** - drips flow downward, liquids pool at bottom
- **Layer interaction REQUIRED** - contaminants overlap naturally (rust under oils, etc.)
- **Texture variation REQUIRED** - no perfectly smooth/uniform contamination surfaces
- **Light interaction REQUIRED** - shadows, reflections, absorption appropriate to contamination type
- **Uneven distribution REQUIRED** - heavier in recesses, lighter on edges/high points
- **Weathering progression** - show aged vs fresh contamination differences where appropriate
- **Physics compliance** - all contamination must obey gravity and material adhesion properties
- **NO impossible locations** - contamination only where it could naturally accumulate
- **Reference real photos** - contamination should match actual industrial/environmental buildup patterns

**RIGHT SIDE - Clean**:
- True {MATERIAL} appearance fully visible
- 90-95% contamination removed
- Trace residue only in deep crevices
- Same permanent features as left

## Lighting

- Professional quality, neutral temperature
- Soft overhead with fill
- Gentle highlights on clean surfaces
- Subtle shadows in Contextual mode, none in Isolated
