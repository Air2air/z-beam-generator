# =============================================================================
# PROMPT TEMPLATES
# =============================================================================
# All prompt templates moved to domains/materials/prompts/*.txt files
# This maintains separation: configs = system behavior, prompts = content instructions
# See docs/08-development/WORD_COUNT_IN_PROMPTS_POLICY.md

# Legacy prompts section removed (Dec 29, 2025)
# Prompt files available:
#   - micro.txt, faq.txt, description.txt
#   - excerpt.txt, context.txt, power_intensity.txt
#   - page_title.txt, meta_description.txt, seo_description.txt
#   - And 4 more relationship description prompts

# prompts_deprecated: Removed Dec 29, 2025 - All prompts in domains/materials/prompts/*.txt
