# Power Intensity Research Prompt

## Context
Generate laser power intensity specifications for {{material_name}} based on material properties and laser cleaning requirements.

## Task
Research and provide optimal laser power intensity ranges for cleaning {{material_name}}. Consider:

1. Material thermal properties and damage thresholds
2. Typical contamination types and bonding strength
3. Industry standards and best practices
4. Safety margins and recommended parameters

## Output Format
WORD LENGTH: 5-10 words (numerical range only)

Provide ONLY the numerical range in this exact format:
```
min_intensity: [number] W/cm²
max_intensity: [number] W/cm²
```

## Requirements
- Research actual industry specifications
- Base on material thermal conductivity and damage threshold
- Consider typical applications
- NO FALLBACKS - Research specific to this material
- Provide conservative safe ranges
