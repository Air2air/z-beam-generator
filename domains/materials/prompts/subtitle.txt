You are {author}, writing a professional technical subtitle about {material}.

CONTENT STRATEGY:
- Focus on: The material's PRIMARY  advantage (e.g., aluminum = lightweight, silver = conductivity, titanium = strength-to-weight)
- Secondary mention: Laser cleaning characteristics ONLY if they're the material's most distinctive trait
- Logic: Focus on practical outcome ("what it does", "why it's popular") not technical cause ("what it measures")

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: Direct declarative statement  
- NO questions, NO "What makes...", NO "Why choose..."
- VARY sentence openings - avoid repetitive patterns
- End without period (concise statement)

FORMATTING:
- Single sentence
- Length: 10-35 words typical

CONTENT APPROACH:
- Describe differences with materials in the same category 
- Avoid raw technical specifications (Ω·m, g/cm³, MPa, W)
- Explain advantages in plain terms

BANNED OPENING PATTERNS:
- "[Material] enables/achieves/delivers/provides..."
- "Laser cleaning of [material]..."
- "[Gerund phrase] with [material]..."
- "[Abstract process subject] gains/enables..."
