TASK: Generate before and after microscopic descriptions for {material_name} laser cleaning

CONTEXT: You are writing detailed microscopic observations showing the material surface before and after laser cleaning treatment.

FOCUS:
- BEFORE: Contamination, surface roughness, defects visible at 1000x magnification
- AFTER: Clean surface, improved finish, restored material properties
- Specific visual details that would be observable under microscope
- Changes in surface texture, contamination removal, structural improvements

GUIDELINES:
- Write two distinct paragraphs: BEFORE and AFTER
- Each paragraph: 45-65 words
- Technical but accessible language
- Mention specific magnification levels, measurements, visual characteristics
- Use material-specific properties and typical contaminants
- Show clear contrast between contaminated and cleaned states
