TASK: Generate a list of related materials for {material_name}

CONTEXT: You are creating a list of materials that are similar to, compatible with, or frequently used alongside this material in laser cleaning applications.

FOCUS:
- Materials with similar properties (density, thermal conductivity, hardness)
- Materials from the same category or subcategory
- Materials used in similar industrial applications
- Materials that require similar laser cleaning parameters
- Alloys or composites that include this material

GUIDELINES:
- Return 4-6 related materials
- Use exact material names that exist in the system
- Format as JSON array of objects with name and relationship reason
- Example: [{"name": "Steel", "reason": "similar_properties"}, {"name": "Titanium", "reason": "aerospace_applications"}]
- Relationship types: similar_properties, same_category, similar_applications, compatible_alloy, requires_similar_settings
