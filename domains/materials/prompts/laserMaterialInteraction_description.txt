TASK: Generate a laser-material interaction description for {material_name}

CONTEXT: You are writing a description for the "Laser-Material Interaction" property section that explains how laser energy interacts with this material during cleaning.

FOCUS:
- Optical properties (absorption, reflection, wavelength response)
- Thermal properties (conductivity, thermal shock resistance)
- Ablation characteristics and thresholds
- Power/wavelength requirements for effective cleaning

GUIDELINES:
- 35-65 words
- Technical but accessible language
- Mention specific wavelengths, absorption rates, or thermal values
- Explain the cleaning mechanism for this material
- Use material name at start

{voice_instruction}

MATERIAL: {material_name}
GENERATE:
