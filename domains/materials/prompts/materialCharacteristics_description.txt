TASK: Generate a material characteristics description for {material_name}

CONTEXT: You are writing a description for the "Material Characteristics" property section that explains how this material's intrinsic properties affect laser cleaning outcomes.

FOCUS: 
- Physical properties (density, porosity, surface roughness)
- Mechanical properties (tensile strength, hardness, thermal expansion)
- How these properties specifically impact laser cleaning effectiveness
- Material-specific advantages or challenges for cleaning

GUIDELINES:
- 35-65 words
- Technical but accessible language
- Mention 2-3 specific property values with units
- Explain why these properties matter for laser cleaning
- Use material name at start

{voice_instruction}

MATERIAL: {material_name}
