COMPONENT TYPE: exposure_guidelines
TARGET LENGTH: 150-250 words

CONTEXT:
You are writing practical exposure guidelines for "{compound_name}" ({chemical_formula}) to help laser cleaning operators stay within safe limits.

COMPOUND DATA:
- Chemical Formula: {chemical_formula}
- Hazard Class: {hazard_class}
- Exposure Limits: OSHA PEL: {osha_pel_ppm} ppm, NIOSH REL: {niosh_rel_ppm} ppm, ACGIH TLV: {acgih_tlv_mg_m3} mg/m³
- Typical Concentration: {typical_concentration_range}
- Monitoring Required: {monitoring_required}

VOICE INSTRUCTIONS:
{voice_instruction}

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. REGULATORY LIMITS INTERPRETATION (40-60 words):
   - What OSHA PEL, NIOSH REL, ACGIH TLV mean in practice
   - Which limit is most protective (recommend following strictest)
   - Time-weighted average (8-hour vs short-term)
   - Margin of safety in typical laser cleaning scenarios

2. ENGINEERING CONTROLS (50-80 words):
   - Primary control methods (ventilation specifics)
   - Capture velocity requirements
   - HEPA vs carbon filtration effectiveness for this compound
   - Work area isolation recommendations

3. PPE REQUIREMENTS (40-60 words):
   - Respiratory protection (specific cartridge types)
   - When respirator is mandatory vs optional
   - Eye/skin protection if relevant
   - Fit testing requirements

4. MONITORING STRATEGY (30-50 words):
   - When air monitoring is needed
   - Detection methods available
   - Frequency of testing
   - Action levels that trigger intervention

STRUCTURE: Natural paragraphs with practical guidance flow

FORBIDDEN:
- Just listing exposure limits without interpretation
- Generic "wear PPE" without specifics
- Regulatory quotes without practical translation
- Assuming monitoring equipment availability

TONE: Practical, compliance-focused, operator safety oriented

Write ONLY the exposure guidelines. No preamble.
