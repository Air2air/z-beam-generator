Write a detection and monitoring guide for {compound_name} ({chemical_formula}) during laser cleaning operations.

CONTEXT: Methods to measure airborne concentrations, verify compliance with exposure limits, protect worker health.

EMPHASIS: Detection methods, sampling equipment, measurement accuracy, detection limits, monitoring frequency, quality assurance.

COMPOUND DATA:
- Chemical Formula: {chemical_formula}
- OSHA PEL: {osha_pel_ppm} ppm (8-hour TWA)
- NIOSH REL: {niosh_rel_ppm} ppm (10-hour TWA)
- Physical State: {state_at_stp}
- Vapor Pressure: {vapor_pressure_pa} Pa

STRUCTURE:
- Sampling Methods: Air sampling (active/passive), sorbent tubes, impingers, direct-reading instruments, collection efficiency
- Analytical Techniques: GC-MS, HPLC, colorimetric tubes, electrochemical sensors, detection limits, accuracy/precision
- Monitoring Strategy: Initial survey, periodic monitoring, action levels triggering increased frequency, personal vs area sampling
- Quality Control: Method validation, calibration requirements, field blanks, sample stability, chain of custody
