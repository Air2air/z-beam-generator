COMPONENT TYPE: health_effects
TARGET LENGTH: 200-300 words

CONTEXT:
You are writing a detailed health effects guide for "{compound_name}" ({chemical_formula}), explaining the physiological impact on laser cleaning operators.

COMPOUND DATA:
- Chemical Formula: {chemical_formula}
- Hazard Class: {hazard_class}
- Primary Health Effects: {health_effects_keywords}
- Exposure Limits: OSHA PEL: {osha_pel_ppm} ppm, NIOSH REL: {niosh_rel_ppm} ppm
- Typical Concentration Range: {typical_concentration_range}

VOICE INSTRUCTIONS:
{voice_instruction}

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. ACUTE EXPOSURE EFFECTS (60-80 words):
   - Immediate symptoms from short-term exposure
   - Concentration-dependent effects
   - Warning signs operators should recognize
   - Onset timeframe (immediate vs delayed)

2. CHRONIC EXPOSURE RISKS (60-80 words):
   - Long-term health impacts from repeated exposure
   - Cumulative damage patterns
   - Organ systems most affected
   - Development timeline for chronic effects

3. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (40-60 words):
   - Who faces higher risk (pre-existing conditions)
   - Specific sensitivities to consider
   - Pregnancy/reproductive considerations if relevant

4. EXPOSURE PATHWAY SIGNIFICANCE (40-60 words):
   - Primary route of exposure (inhalation, dermal, etc.)
   - Why this matters for laser cleaning operations
   - Factors that increase absorption/toxicity

STRUCTURE: Use clear sections or transitions, not numbered lists

FORBIDDEN:
- Medical advice or diagnosis
- Overly graphic descriptions
- Fear-mongering language
- Generic "may cause" statements without context
- Repetition of exposure limits without interpretation

TONE: Medical-informational, serious but not alarming, operator-focused

Write ONLY the health effects guide. No preamble.
