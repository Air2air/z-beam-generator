  before: Microscopic examination of the untreated brass surface reveals meticulous
    evidence of heavy contamination from atmospheric oxidation and particulate dirt,
    forming a dull, tarnished layer. Visible degradation includes pitting and micro-cracks
    across the alloy grains, with irregular discoloration and embedded debris compromising
    the craftsmanship of the metallic luster and structural integrity.
  after: Post-laser cleaning microscopy reveals a restored brass surface, achieved
    with meticulous removal of contaminants, unveiling a smooth, polished finish of
    refined elegance. Material integrity remains intact, exhibiting uniform grain
    structure without ablation damage, enhanced reflectivity, and minimal residual
    pitting for optimal precision in surface condition.
