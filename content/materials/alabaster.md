  questions:
  - question: How can I safely clean dirt from my Alabaster sculpture without causing
      scratches?
    answer: Employ laser ablation techniques to gently vaporize surface contaminants,
      preserving the material's low hardness integrity. This non-contact method avoids
      mechanical abrasion, ensuring the artifact's smooth texture remains undamaged
      while achieving precise restoration.
  - question: What are effective ways to prevent moisture damage on Alabaster architectural
      elements?
    answer: Store items in controlled humidity environments below 50% RH to mitigate
      dissolution risks from calcium sulfate. For cleaning, opt for dry laser processes
      that eliminate pollutants without introducing liquids, maintaining structural
      stability over time.
  - question: How do I remove rust stains from Alabaster artifacts without harming
      their natural patina?
    answer: Utilize pulsed laser systems at low fluence levels to selectively ablate
      iron oxide deposits, retaining the original surface sheen. This approach outperforms
      solvents by preventing chemical reactions that could alter translucency or cause
      discoloration.
  - question: What best practices should I follow for handling Alabaster during restoration
      projects?
    answer: Use padded supports and minimize direct contact to protect against abrasion
      due to Mohs 1.5-2 rating. Integrate fiber laser cleaning for debris removal,
      offering superior precision over manual brushing and reducing handling-induced
      fractures.
  - question: Is laser cleaning a good option for maintaining the translucency of
      oriental Alabaster carvings?
    answer: Yes, short-pulse lasers effectively target impurities like silica without
      affecting the calcite structure's Mohs 3 hardness. Compared to traditional polishing,
      it preserves optical clarity and veined patterns, ideal for conservation in
      museum settings.
  - question: How can I address discoloration in Alabaster from environmental pollutants?
    answer: Apply Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers to break down oxide layers at 1064 nm wavelength,
      restoring uniform pigmentation. This technique surpasses wet methods by avoiding
      porosity exacerbation, ensuring long-term aesthetic enhancement in heritage
      sites.
  - question: What advantages does laser technology offer over chemical cleaners for
      Alabaster care?
    answer: Laser methods provide non-invasive, residue-free surface renewal, bypassing
      solubility issues of gypsum varieties. With adjustable energy densities, they
      enable targeted treatment for banded impurities, promoting durability without
      the hazards of harsh reagents.
  - question: Can Alabaster facade panels withstand laser restoration without structural
      weakening?
    answer: Absolutely, controlled laser parameters under 1 J/cmÂ² prevent thermal
      stress on soft sulfates, unlike abrasive techniques that risk cracking. This
      preserves historical integrity for medieval elements while effectively removing
      accumulated grime.

caption:
  before: Microscopic examination of the alabaster surface before laser cleaning discloses
    dense accumulation of fine carbonaceous soot and siliceous particulates, inducing
    pronounced surface degradation with irregular pitting, microcracks, and localized
    delamination. Embedded contaminants cause severe discoloration and erosion of
    the gypsum matrix, compromising structural integrity at the grain interfaces.
  after: Microscopy of the alabaster surface post-laser cleaning demonstrates high-fidelity
    restoration, featuring a smooth, contaminant-free topography with preserved gypsum
    crystallite morphology and negligible thermal effects. The material exhibits enhanced
    clarity, uniform reflectance, and intact microstructural integrity, validating
    effective conservation without subsurface damage.
