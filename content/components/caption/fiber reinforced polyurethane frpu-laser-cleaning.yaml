# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no delamination.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
