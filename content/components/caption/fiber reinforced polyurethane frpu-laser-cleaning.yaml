  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no delamination.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
