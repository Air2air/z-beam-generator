  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the shale stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The shale exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The shale substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
