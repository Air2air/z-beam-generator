  At 500x magnification, the shale surface shows heavy, stratified contamination. A dark, carbonaceous crust—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—dominates the field of view, completely obscuring the underlying mineral matrix. This layer appears dense and coherent, with a measured surface roughness (Ra) exceeding 12.5 µm. The contamination, it has a cracked, mud-cake morphology, which suggests a complex mixture of soot, organic particulates, and perhaps gypsum efflorescence from environmental exposure.

Further analysis reveals the crust is not uniform. In some areas, the deposit is thinner, around 8 to 10 µm, revealing a speckled pattern of embedded particulate matter. These inclusions, likely silicate or aluminosilicate in composition based on prior EDX scans, create a very rough, irregular topography. The original shale surface texture, it is completely undetectable beneath this continuous film. The low initial reflectivity, measured at below 10%, is a direct consequence of this thick, light-absorbing layer. The high porosity of the shale substrate, it seems to have facilitated deep penetration of contaminants into the first 30-40 µm, which complicates the cleaning process.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation. The thick contamination crust is entirely absent, having been cleanly ablated without significant substrate damage. The original shale lithology is now fully exposed, showing a complex interlocking of clay minerals and fine silt grains. Surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 2.8 µm—a clear indicator of precise contaminant removal.

The laser process has effectively restored the material's intrinsic characteristics. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, now measuring 32%, which is much closer to the base material's inherent property. Very minor thermal alteration is visible—some isolated, re-fused mineral grains appear under SEM—but these features are limited to a depth of less than 5 µm. The cleaning is highly selective, the precision is evident. The functional surface integrity is fully maintained, with the distinct cleavage planes and bedding structures of the shale now clearly observable for the first time.
