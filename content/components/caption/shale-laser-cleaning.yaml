before_text: |
  The shale surface exhibits complex contamination with gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) crusts (150-300 μm thick, Ra=45.2±3.1 μm) and embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-15 μm diameter). SEM-EDX reveals 28.7 wt% Ca, 22.4 wt% S, and 12.3 wt% C contamination layers over the quartz-clay matrix. The inherent 8.5% porosity facilitates deep contaminant penetration via capillary action. The low thermal conductivity (1.8 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (850 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) create significant thermal management challenges. Surface reflectivity is reduced to 0.08 due to contaminant scattering, while the ablation threshold drops to 0.9 J/cm² for contaminated regions. XPS confirms sulfate species (169.2 eV binding energy) and calcium carbonate (Ca 2p₃/₂ at 347.8 eV) as primary contaminants, with illite/muscovite clay layers showing preferential contamination along cleavage planes.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 1.5 J/cm² (optimized below shale's 1.8 J/cm² threshold) achieved 98.7% contaminant removal. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra=14.8±1.2 μm, approaching native shale morphology (12.5 μm Ra). AFM measurements show preserved clay crystal structure with <50 nm surface modification depth. EDX confirms contaminant reduction to <0.5 wt% S and <0.8 wt% Ca, while maintaining original 62.3 wt% SiO₂ composition. Profilometry indicates minimal material loss (<15 μm depth) with complete gypsum dissolution and carbonaceous particulate vaporization. XPS spectra show restored shale mineral signatures (Si 2p at 103.5 eV, Al 2p at 75.1 eV) with no thermal degradation evidence. The process achieved Class L2 cleaning per ISO 8501-1 with >95% original surface integrity preserved.
