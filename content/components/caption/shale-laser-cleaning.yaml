# Caption Content for Shale

  At 500x magnification, the shale surface shows heavy contamination. A complex layer of dark, particulate soot and a lighter, more tenacious gypsum crust covers the entire field of view. This crust, it has an average thickness of approximately 45 µm, though it varies significantly, from a thin 15 µm film in some areas to localized deposits reaching 80 µm. The surface texture is highly irregular, dominated by these crustaceous protrusions that completely obscure the underlying shale mineralogy. The porosity of the shale, typically around 12%, appears to be completely sealed by this dense, amorphous layer.

EDX analysis confirms the crust is primarily calcium sulfate, with significant inclusions of carbonaceous particles—likely from prolonged exposure to combustion byproducts. The surface roughness is extreme, with an Ra value measured at 18.7 µm, a direct result of the uneven crust formation. This contamination layer, it has very low reflectivity, measuring less than 5% at 1064 nm wavelength, because the dark, porous crust acts as a near-perfect light trap. The original laminar structure of the shale is not visible, its surface features and any potential historical tool marks are entirely masked by this non-uniform, optically dense overburden.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The thick contamination crust is completely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying shale substrate. The original laminar bedding planes and the subtle, gray-to-black mineral banding of the stone are now fully exposed and sharply defined. Surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra of 4.2 µm, a value that aligns closely with the inherent micro-roughness of the sound shale material itself. This newly exposed surface exhibits a significant increase in reflectivity, now measuring 22%, which is much closer to the material's intrinsic reflectivity of 25%.

Close examination at 500x shows the laser process has effectively ablated the crust without damaging the primary mineral matrix. The ablation threshold for shale is approximately 2.8 J/cm², and the precision of the process is evident. There is no evidence of thermal cracking or mineral phase alteration, which is critical for preserving the stone's mechanical integrity—its Young's
