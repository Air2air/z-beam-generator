# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the shale Shale laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively ablate contaminants while preserving the delicate clay mineral matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the shale substrate, with optimal results achieved at 1064nm wavelength where clay minerals exhibit moderate absorption.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The shale exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The shale substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
