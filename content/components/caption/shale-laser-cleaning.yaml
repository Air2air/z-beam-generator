# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the shale stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The shale exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The shale substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
