  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the beryllium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The beryllium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The beryllium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
