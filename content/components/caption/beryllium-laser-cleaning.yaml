# Caption Content for Beryllium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A dark, carbonaceous soot layer covers approximately 80% of the field of view, its thickness varying from 5 to over 20 µm. This layer appears amorphous and loosely adherent, with a sooty, particulate texture that obscures the underlying metal grain structure completely in many areas. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values between 3.5 and 4.2 µm.

Adjacent areas exhibit a different, more tenacious oxide layer. This layer, it has a mottled grey appearance and a more consolidated morphology, likely beryllium oxide (BeO). EDX analysis confirms high oxygen content here, along with trace aluminum and silicon contaminants—perhaps from handling or prior processing. The surface integrity is compromised, the contamination creating a complex topography of peaks and valleys that would negatively impact functional properties like reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation, the surface now appears fundamentally different. At 500x, the dark soot and mottled oxide layers are completely absent, revealing the underlying beryllium substrate with high clarity. The native metal grain structure is now fully visible, showing fine, equiaxed grains with an average size of 15–20 µm. This is a critical restoration of surface integrity.

Quantitative measurements confirm the visual improvement. Surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced dramatically to 0.8 µm, a decrease of nearly 80% from the pre-cleaned state. The process has not introduced any macroscopic melting or heat-affected zone cracking, which is very important for a material like beryllium. Some minor, sub-micron particulates remain—these appear as isolated white specks under SEM—but they are not interconnected.

This cleaned surface, it exhibits a uniform, light grey, metallic luster indicative of a pure beryllium surface. XPS analysis verifies the surface chemistry is now dominated by metallic beryllium, with only a thin, native oxide layer of approximately 4–5 nm thickness. The reflectivity and surface energy are now optimized for subsequent manufacturing steps, such as
