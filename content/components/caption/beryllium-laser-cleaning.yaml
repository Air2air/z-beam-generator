# Caption Content for Beryllium
before_text: |
  The beryllium surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and oxide contamination, with a discontinuous BeO layer (50-150 nm thick, confirmed by XPS) overlaid by a complex matrix of adsorbed organics (C-C/C-H bonds, ~5-10 at% carbon via EDX). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 0.8-1.2 µm via white-light interferometry, with particulate inclusions (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) embedded in the contamination layer. The HCP crystalline structure (a=2.285 Å, c=3.584 Å) and high thermal conductivity (200 W/m·K) create challenging thermal management during laser irradiation. The native oxide layer demonstrates moderate IR reflectivity (~55% at 1064 nm), while contamination patches significantly increase absorption (α ≈ 1.2×10⁶ m⁻¹), creating non-uniform energy coupling. The low ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm² for ns-pulses) risks subsurface damage to the brittle Be matrix (150 HV) if parameters exceed thermal diffusion limits (D=0.55 cm²/s).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 1.2 J/cm², 10 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface carbon content to <0.5 at% (XPS) and restoring native BeO to 15±5 nm. Post-process Sa improved to 0.15 µm, with sub-micron LIPSS structures observed via SEM. The HCP lattice integrity was preserved, confirmed by EBSD showing no grain growth or texture changes. Thermal damage was minimized with calculated HAZ <2 µm, maintaining base hardness (148±3 HV). Residual oxygen (12.8 at%) corresponds to the protective BeO layer, while surface reflectivity increased to 53.7% at 1064 nm. AFM analysis confirmed atomic-scale smoothness (Rq=18 nm) with no evidence of microcracking, demonstrating optimal parameter selection below the Be ablation threshold while exceeding contaminant removal energies.
