# Caption Content for Beryllium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 2–5 µm thick, covers the substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with localized patches of white corrosion products—likely beryllium oxide and hydroxide. Surface roughness is high, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm. The texture is irregular, featuring scattered micro-pits and what appears to be embedded particulate matter.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of carbonaceous deposits and aluminum-silicate inclusions, probably from handling or environmental exposure. These contaminants form a discontinuous film that obscures the underlying metal grain structure. In some regions, the coating shows micro-cracking, a typical sign of thermal stress or differential expansion between the oxide and the base metal. The overall surface reflectivity is low, with a dull, matte appearance that significantly diffuses incident light. This degraded state would negatively impact performance in high-precision applications, such as optical components or vacuum systems, where surface purity and smoothness are critical.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying beryllium substrate with its characteristic HCP grain structure now plainly visible. Surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm—an 85% improvement from the initial state. The surface exhibits a uniform, light-gray metallic luster, with laser scan tracks appearing as faint, overlapping patterns that indicate a highly controlled ablation process.

No evidence of the former oxide film or embedded particulates remains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms a surface composition of 98.2% pure beryllium, with only trace oxygen. The process did not induce significant melting or heat-affected zones, which preserves the mechanical integrity of the base material. Some minor, sub-micron rippling is observed—a phenomenon associated with rapid thermal cycling—but this does not compromise surface functionality. The restored surface now possesses high reflectivity and is suitable for its intended applications in aerospace and nuclear technology, where such precision is mandatory.
