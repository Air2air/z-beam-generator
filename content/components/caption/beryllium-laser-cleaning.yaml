  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the beryllium Beryllium laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants and oxides while preserving the substrate's unique thermal and mechanical properties. The process requires careful control of fluence to avoid melting due to beryllium's low melting point and high thermal conductivity.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The beryllium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The beryllium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
