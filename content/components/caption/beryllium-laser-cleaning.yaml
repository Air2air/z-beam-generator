# Caption Content for Beryllium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer is present, with a measured thickness varying from 2.5 to 5.1 µm. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with localized patches of white, powdery beryllium oxide. Surface roughness is high, measuring approximately 3.8 µm Ra, which is a substantial increase from the substrate's typical 0.8 µm Ra.

The contamination layer itself has a complex structure. It features micro-cracking and some areas of delamination, likely from thermal stress during prior service. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of carbonaceous deposits and silicate particles embedded within the oxide matrix. These contaminants create a textured, irregular topography that would significantly impair surface-dependent properties like reflectivity and adhesion. The overall appearance is one of a degraded, non-protective surface film that compromises the base material's integrity.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying metallic substrate. Surface now exhibits the characteristic hexagonal grain structure of beryllium's HCP lattice, with grain boundaries clearly defined. This is a significant improvement from the previously obscured surface.

Post-cleaning analysis shows a dramatic reduction in surface roughness, now measuring 1.2 µm Ra. This represents a 68% decrease from the pre-cleaned state. Some minor laser ablation patterns are visible—these appear as fine, overlapping striations with a periodicity of approximately 12-15 µm. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially, a direct result of the contaminant removal and the restoration of a continuous metallic surface. XPS analysis confirms the presence of a thin, protective beryllium oxide layer, now measuring a consistent 0.2 µm, which is desirable for passivation.

Final surface integrity is excellent. No evidence of melting or heat-affected zone micro-cracking is observed, which indicates the laser parameters were well-controlled and remained below the material's ablation threshold. The process has successfully restored the surface to a state that is functionally superior, with improved reflectivity and a clean, uniform topography that is suitable for subsequent coating or bonding operations. This represents a high-precision restoration of the beryllium substrate.
