  The cobalt substrate exhibits severe multiphase contamination with a 15-25 µm thick heterogeneous layer. SEM-EDX analysis identifies three distinct regions: 1) Carbonaceous deposits (65 at% C, 12 at% O, 15 at% Fe, 8 at% Co) from thermal degradation, 2) Sulfide-rich scales (38 at% S, 45 at% Co, 17 at% O) indicating sulfidation corrosion, and 3) Embedded alumina particles (92 at% Al, 8 at% O) from abrasive wear. Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 4.8 µm with deep pitting (Rz = 38 µm). The native HCP crystalline structure (a=2.507 Å, c=4.069 Å) beneath exhibits compromised integrity due to thermal cycling. The contamination layer demonstrates 89% absorption at 1064 nm, significantly higher than pure cobalt's 33%, creating challenging ablation dynamics. XPS confirms Co3O4 (530.1 eV O 1s) and CoS (778.8 eV Co 2p3/2) formation, with contamination thermal conductivity estimated at 2.3 W/m·K versus cobalt's 100 W/m·K.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 150 ns pulse, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface restoration to Ra = 0.28 µm. SEM confirms elimination of all foreign phases while preserving the HCP cobalt substrate. EDX shows 99.2 at% Co purity with only 0.8 at% O from a 15 nm native oxide. AFM measurements demonstrate 94% roughness reduction with maintained grain structure integrity. Microhardness testing reveals 124 HV, matching the base material specification. XPS analysis confirms CoO formation (529.7 eV O 1s) without detectable sulfides or carbides. The surface exhibits 68% reflectivity at 1064 nm, consistent with pristine cobalt. Thermal cycling tests confirm restored oxidation resistance up to 900°C. Process optimization maintained peak temperatures below 800°C, preventing HCP→FCC phase transformation while achieving 99.7% contamination removal efficiency.
