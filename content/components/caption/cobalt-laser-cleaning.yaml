  At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A complex layer of foreign deposits, measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm in total thickness, completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. This layer, it has a non-uniform, crust-like morphology with visible stratification—darker, carbon-rich regions sit atop a lighter, oxidized underlayer. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values between 3.5 and 4.2 µm. The topography is chaotic, dominated by particulate agglomerates and what appears to be intergranular corrosion products.

EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, with trace amounts of sulfur and chlorine also detected. This suggests the presence of both organic films and inorganic oxides. The visual texture is very porous and friable, with numerous micro-fissures propagating through the deposit. These cracks, they expose subtle glimpses of the base metal, but the overall surface integrity is compromised. The reflectivity is consequently very low, the surface appearing matte and optically dull, which is a direct indicator of its degraded functional state for precision applications.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the surface transformation is very clear. At 500x magnification, the contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the true cobalt substrate with a restored, metallic luster. The previous Ra of ~4.2 µm is now reduced to a much smoother 0.8 µm—or more precisely—0.78 µm. This significant decrease in surface roughness is visually apparent as the once chaotic topography now shows a uniform, laser-matted finish with a consistent pattern of fine, overlapping ablation tracks.

The cleaning efficacy is nearly complete, XPS analysis indicates oxygen atomic concentration dropped from over 40% to just 7.2%, confirming the successful removal of the oxide scale. Some minor features remain, of course, like faint, sub-micron traces of the original grain boundaries, but these do not compromise the surface integrity. The reflectivity has increased dramatically, the surface now exhibits a diffuse but bright gleam. This cleaned state, it directly correlates to improved performance for subsequent processes like coating adhesion or biocompatibility, the surface is now functionally restored for its intended role.
