# Caption Content for Cobalt
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 3–5 µm thick, covers the substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with localized patches of greenish-blue corrosion products—likely cobalt hydroxides or carbonates. Surface roughness is high, with Ra measurements indicating values around 2.8 µm. This texture creates a porous, irregular topography that traps further particulate matter.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of oxygen, carbon, and sulfur, suggesting atmospheric oxidation and potential exposure to industrial pollutants. The contamination layer is not continuous; it exhibits micro-cracking and spallation in several regions, which exposes the underlying metal to further degradation. Visually, the surface lacks metallic luster entirely, appearing dull and blotchy. The original machining marks from the cobalt's fabrication are completely obscured by this adherent scale. This degraded state, it would negatively impact functional properties like reflectivity and promote continued chemical attack.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying cobalt substrate with a restored metallic sheen. Surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 0.4 µm. The original, fine machining marks from the manufacturing process are now fully visible, appearing as a uniform, directional grain.

Some subtle effects from the laser interaction are observable. A slight increase in micro-texturing is present, which actually enhances surface area for potential coating adhesion. Minor resolidified splatter, less than 10 µm in diameter, is visible in isolated spots—this is a typical byproduct of the ablation process. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, and XPS analysis confirms a thin, passive oxide layer of only 50-100 nm, which is desirable for corrosion resistance. The cleaning process successfully restored the surface integrity without causing measurable ablation damage to the base metal.
