  At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 3–5 µm thick, covers the substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with regions of blue and gold interference coloring, which indicates variable thickness. Surface roughness is high, measuring 4.2 µm Ra. This is a substantial increase from the base material's typical 0.8 µm Ra.

Distinct particulate contaminants—likely embedded alumina from prior processing—are visible as light-colored, angular features. They are scattered randomly, with sizes ranging from 10 to 25 µm. The underlying metal surface, where visible, shows a dull, matte grey appearance. This is characteristic of a heavily oxidized state. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) would likely confirm high oxygen content, probably forming CoO and Co3O4. The overall surface integrity is compromised, which would negatively affect functional properties like reflectivity and adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated oxide layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying metallic substrate. Surface now exhibits a bright, reflective finish, which is a marked contrast to the previous dull grey. Initial visual assessment shows a significant reduction in surface roughness, now measured at 1.1 µm Ra. This is much closer to the original polished state.

The cleaning process has left a subtle, faint striation pattern. These parallel lines, with a spacing of approximately 12–15 µm, correspond to the laser scan path. They are a direct result of the overlapping pulses and do not indicate damage. All the previous particulate contaminants are gone. The surface is uniformly clean, with no evidence of the former mottled oxide film. This restoration of surface integrity is critical for applications requiring high purity, like medical devices.

Some minor micro-pitting is observable—perhaps from localized ablation of impurities. These features are shallow, less than 2 µm deep, and do not compromise the surface's mechanical integrity. The primary surface is fully restored, showing the characteristic grain structure of the cobalt. This cleaned state provides an optimal surface for subsequent coating or bonding operations, with reflectivity restored to near-original levels. The process is very
