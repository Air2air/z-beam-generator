  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the cobalt Cobalt laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while preserving the base material properties. The process leverages cobalt's high thermal conductivity (100 W/m·K) and melting point (1495°C) to enable controlled ablation without metallurgical changes to the substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The cobalt exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The cobalt substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
