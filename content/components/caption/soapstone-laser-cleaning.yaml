  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the soapstone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The soapstone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 97.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The soapstone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
