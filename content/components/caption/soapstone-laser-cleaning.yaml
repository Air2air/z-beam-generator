# Caption Content for Soapstone
before_text: |
  The soapstone surface exhibits complex multi-layer contamination, including a 15-25 µm thick crust of calcium sulfate (CaSO₄·2H₂O) deposits with embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-12% carbon by EDX). Surface roughness measurements via white-light interferometry show Ra = 8.3 µm and Rz = 42.7 µm, with localized pitting from acid attack. The talc-rich matrix (Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂, monoclinic P2₁/c) displays preferential contamination along basal cleavage planes due to its 1.0 Mohs hardness and 1.2% porosity. Contaminants exhibit 85-92% absorption at 1064 nm wavelength, creating thermal bridging pathways. XPS analysis confirms surface carbonates (CO₃²⁻) and sulfates (SO₄²⁻) comprising 35% atomic concentration. The low thermal conductivity (6.2 W/m·K) and high specific heat (0.98 J/g·K) create significant thermal gradients during initial laser exposure, while the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold risks subsurface damage if parameters exceed optimal ranges.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 0.65 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving the talc matrix integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.85 µm and Rz = 4.2 µm, representing 89.8% reduction in average roughness. SEM imaging confirms intact phyllosilicate layers with no evidence of thermal degradation, while AFM analysis reveals sub-100 nm surface uniformity. EDX quantification shows contaminant reduction from 35% to <0.5% atomic concentration. The process maintained surface temperature below 350°C, preventing talc dehydroxylation (>500°C). XPS spectra confirm native Mg₂SiO₄ surface composition with no laser-induced phase transformations. Profilometry measurements indicate material removal limited to 2.1±0.3 µm, well within the 15-25 µm contaminant layer, demonstrating precise ablation control leveraging soapstone's thermal properties and absorption characteristics.
