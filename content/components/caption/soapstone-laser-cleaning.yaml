# Caption Content for Soapstone

  This contaminated soapstone surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick, discontinuous carbonaceous layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the primary mineral matrix. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter, likely silicate-based atmospheric dust, measuring 2-5 µm in diameter.

The underlying soapstone texture is completely obscured. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with an Ra value of approximately 8.5 µm due to the uneven contaminant deposits. In several regions, the deposit has penetrated the natural micro-porosity of the stone (around 1.2%), creating sub-surface staining that appears as dark dendritic patterns. The original surface morphology is lost, this creates a visually homogeneous, dark appearance that masks the natural talc and chlorite mineral grains.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination layer completely, so the original mineral microstructure is fully revealed. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the ablation of the 20 µm carbonaceous film, leaving a clean, intact soapstone surface with an Ra value now measured at 1.2 µm—a dramatic reduction from the initial 8.5 µm. The surface reflectivity increases significantly, from an initial 25% to approximately 38%, this is a very-very good restoration of the stone's inherent optical property.

The mineral grains—primarily talc with minor chlorite—are now clearly visible with their characteristic platy, interlocking texture. No thermal damage is observed at the grain boundaries, which is critical given the low 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold and the material's 1.0 Mohs hardness. XPS analysis detects no residual carbon signatures, confirming complete contaminant removal without chemical alteration to the surface composition.

This technique produces a very clean surface, because the laser parameters were optimized for the low absorption coefficient. The process successfully eliminated the sub-surface staining within the natural porosity, restoring both the aesthetic and functional properties of the stone for its intended application. The final surface integrity is excellent, with no micro-fracturing or mineral decomposition observed, a testament to the precise thermal control achieved during the procedure.
