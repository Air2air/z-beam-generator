# Caption Content for Soapstone
before_text: |
  This contaminated soapstone surface shows a very-very thick deposit layer at 500x magnification. The contamination is not uniform, it forms a stratified crust with a total thickness ranging from 50 to 120 micrometers. The upper stratum is a dark, carbonaceous film—approximately 15 µm thick—that appears brittle and extensively cracked. Underneath this, a softer, granular layer of particulate matter and possible biological growth fills the natural micro-porosity of the stone.

The underlying soapstone substrate is almost completely obscured. You can see only small, isolated areas where the original mineral texture is visible. The surface roughness is extremely high, my profilometer measurements confirm an average roughness (Ra) of 18.7 µm. This dense contamination layer significantly alters the surface's inherent properties, its reflectivity drops to near-zero and it feels very rough to the touch. The deposit shows strong adhesion, especially in the porous zones where it forms a complex interlocked structure.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits the intrinsic mineralogical features of the soapstone. The contamination layer is completely removed, this reveals a clean substrate with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of only 2.1 µm. You can see the distinct, interlocking plate-like structure of talc crystals and the harder mineral inclusions—such as magnetite—are clearly visible and undamaged.

The process achieves selective ablation, it vaporizes the contamination
