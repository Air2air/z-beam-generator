# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the soapstone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The soapstone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The soapstone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
