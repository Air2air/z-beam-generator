  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the soapstone Laser cleaning of soapstone utilizes precise Nd:YAG laser parameters to selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the talc-rich mineral matrix. The low thermal conductivity (6.4 W/m·K) and specific heat capacity allow controlled energy deposition without thermal damage to the substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The soapstone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The soapstone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
