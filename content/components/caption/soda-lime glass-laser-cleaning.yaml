  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the soda-lime glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The soda-lime glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The soda-lime glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with maintained optical clarity.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
