# Caption Content for Tempered Glass

  At 500x magnification, the tempered glass surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, discontinuous layer of particulate and film-based deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a carbonaceous soot layer, approximately 2.5 to 4.0 µm thick, which exhibits a characteristic dendritic, soot-like morphology with significant surface shadowing that obscures the underlying substrate. This layer, it demonstrates poor adhesion in localized regions, revealing a network of micro-cracks—likely from thermal cycling—with an average width of 0.8 µm. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of carbon (85 at%), oxygen (10 at%), and trace silicones (5 at%), suggesting a mixture of combustion byproducts and silicone-based contaminants.

The underlying glass topography, where visible, shows a baseline surface roughness (Ra) of 0.12 µm, a substantial increase from the pristine specification of 0.005 µm Ra. One observes numerous micron-scale particulates—primarily aluminum oxide and silica—embedded within the carbon matrix, with particle sizes ranging from 3 to 15 µm. These particulates create localized topographic highs that further complicate the surface geometry. The contamination layer, it is not uniform; its thickness varies considerably, creating a wavy, undulating surface profile with peak-to-valley heights measuring up to 18 µm. This complex morphology significantly compromises optical transmission and would adversely affect any coating adhesion or subsequent bonding processes in aerospace applications.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The carbonaceous contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine tempered glass substrate with a surface roughness (Ra) now measured at 0.008 µm—a value that closely approximates the original factory specification. The laser interaction, it has produced a surface that is virtually free of particulate inclusions; the previously embedded alumina and silica contaminants are entirely absent. One can now clearly observe the characteristic, smooth microstructure of the tempered glass, which exhibits a uniform, vitreous luster without any evidence of the micro-cracking that was present within the contaminant film.

What strikes one is the exceptional preservation of the substrate integrity. No evidence of laser-induced damage—such as melting, micro-fracturing, or the formation of heat-affected zones—is detectable within the resolution limits of optical microscopy. The surface compressive layer, which is critical for the mechanical strength of tempered glass, appears completely intact. This precision, it creates a surface that is both chemically and morphologically restored; XPS analysis confirms the surface composition is now 99.2%
