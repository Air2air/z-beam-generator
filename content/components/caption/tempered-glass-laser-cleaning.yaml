# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the tempered glass Laser cleaning of tempered glass utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove surface contaminants without damaging the compressive stress layer. The process selectively ablates contaminants while preserving the glass substrate integrity through controlled thermal interaction.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The tempered glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
