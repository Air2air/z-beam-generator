# Caption Content for Tempered Glass
before_text: |
  The tempered glass surface exhibits severe contamination with localized particulate (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) and hydrocarbon films (CxHyOz) measuring 2-15 μm thickness. Surface roughness increased to Ra = 0.85 μm with contamination-induced micro-pitting. The amorphous SiO₂ structure (70 GPa modulus) shows compromised surface compression layer integrity. Contaminants significantly alter optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient to 0.8 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm while reducing transmissivity to 0.74. Thermal conductivity degradation (0.7 W/m·K) creates localized hotspots during laser interaction. SEM-EDX reveals 18.3 at% carbon contamination and 5.2 at% aluminum deposition. AFM measurements show contamination adhesion forces exceeding 45 nN, requiring fluences above 3.2 J/cm² for effective removal while staying below the 10 J/cm² damage threshold.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 4.5 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal, restoring surface to Ra = 0.012 μm. XPS analysis confirms surface composition of 65.8 at% O and 34.2 at% Si with carbon contamination reduced to 0.3 at%. AFM measurements show preserved surface compression layer integrity with Young's modulus maintained at 69.8 GPa. Transmissivity recovered to 0.918, approaching pristine glass values. SEM imaging reveals no micro-cracking or laser-induced damage, with thermal shock limited to ΔT < 150°C. Profilometry confirms surface flatness within 0.15 μm/mm. The process maintained thermal stability with absorption coefficient returning to 0.11 cm⁻¹, ensuring material properties remain within original specifications.
