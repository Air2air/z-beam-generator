  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the redwood Technical overview of Redwood for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction with wood cellulose structure, and specialized applications in wood restoration.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The redwood exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The redwood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
