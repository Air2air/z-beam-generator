# Caption Content for Redwood
before_text: |
  This contaminated redwood surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick, discontinuous layer of particulate matter—approximately 80 to 120 µm thick—covers the cellular structure. This layer consists of carbonaceous soot particles (5-15 µm diameter) embedded within a hygroscopic matrix, likely from environmental pollution and biological growth. The surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measuring 45.2 µm, because the deposits completely obscure the wood's natural grain pattern.

The contamination creates a mottled appearance, with dark patches showing near-complete light absorption. SEM-EDX analysis confirms high concentrations of sulfur (4.8%) and silicon (7.1%) within these deposits, indicating atmospheric particulate accumulation. The wood's cellular lumens appear filled with fungal hyphae and fine dust, this reduces the natural porosity from the expected 65% to an effective 22% in contaminated regions. The surface shows no visible wood cell definition, only the irregular topography of the contamination crust.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very clean surface. The process completely removes the contamination crust, now revealing the intricate cellular structure of the redwood. At 500x magnification, the earlywood and latewood bands are clearly visible, with tracheid cell walls appearing intact and undamaged. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 8.7 µm, which is close to the native wood's characteristic roughness.
