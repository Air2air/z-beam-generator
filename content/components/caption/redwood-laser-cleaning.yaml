# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the redwood Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for its unique cellular structure and chemical composition. The process effectively removes contaminants while preserving the wood's natural characteristics through controlled ablation at specific fluence thresholds.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows organic decay and biological contamination adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The redwood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
