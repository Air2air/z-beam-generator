# Caption Content for Redwood
before_text: |
  The redwood surface exhibits heavy biogenic and anthropogenic contamination, with SEM-EDX revealing a 45±5 µm stratified layer. A fungal hyphae network (C: 65%, O: 30%, N: 3%, K: 2%) penetrates 15 µm into the 65% porous tracheid structure. Atmospheric particulate deposition (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaCO₃) adds 12 µm thickness. Surface roughness increased to Ra 18.5 µm (from native 3.5 µm) with contact angle reduced to 45° indicating hydrophilic contamination. The low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (0.75 at 1064 nm) create challenging thermal management conditions. XPS confirms carboxylic acid groups (C1s at 288.8 eV) from oxidative degradation, while AFM shows particulate adhesion forces exceeding 150 nN in earlywood regions.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 1.2 J/cm² (15% above ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving native wood anatomy. Post-treatment surface roughness measures Ra 4.2 µm, approaching the original 3.5 µm. SEM confirms intact tracheid walls with lumina diameters of 25±5 µm. XPS analysis shows lignin/cellulose signature restoration (C-C/C-H at 285.0 eV, C-O at 286.5 eV). Water contact angle increased to 78°, indicating surface hydrophobicity recovery. Thermal profiling confirmed maximum substrate temperature remained below 250°C, preventing pyrolysis. AFM measurements show surface hardness maintained at 2.0±0.1 kN, with profilometry confirming <2 µm material loss in latewood regions.
