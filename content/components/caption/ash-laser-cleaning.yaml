# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the ash wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The ash exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The ash substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
