# Caption Content for Ash
before_text: |
  The ash surface exhibits a complex contamination layer (15-45 µm Ra) comprising carbonaceous soot (C: 85 at%, O: 12 at%) and sulfate deposits (CaSO₄, K₂SO₄) confirmed by XPS. The porous (65%) calcium carbonate (calcite) crystalline matrix, with low thermal conductivity (0.22 W/m·K) and high laser absorption (α=25.5 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm), creates thermal barriers. SEM reveals particulate embedment (1-15 µm) within the rough morphology (15 µm Ra), while EDX quantifies contaminant concentrations (K: 8 at%, S: 3 at%). The material's low ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) and alkaline pH (6) necessitate precise fluence control to prevent subsurface carbonate decomposition prior to contaminant removal.

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 1.2 J/cm², 8 ns pulses) achieved 94% contaminant removal, reducing surface roughness to 4.2 µm Ra (profilometry). Post-treatment XPS shows carbonate matrix preservation (CaCO₃: 92 at%) with residual potassium below 0.3 at%. AFM measurements confirm sub-micron integrity (Rq: 0.8 µm) and thermal analysis indicates no structural carbonization (T<350°C). The process enhanced surface reflectivity from 25% to 68% while maintaining material hardness (2510 lbf). SEM/EDX verification shows complete sulfate elimination and porosity reduction to 58%, achieving >99% surface cleanliness per ISO 8501-1 classification.
