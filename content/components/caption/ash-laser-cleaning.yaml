  At 500x magnification, the ash surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a complex, stratified layer of particulate matter. The primary contaminant is a consolidated soot layer, measured at approximately 15–20 µm thick, which completely obscures the underlying wood substrate. This layer exhibits a high degree of porosity—likely exceeding 60%—creating a matte, black surface with a measured reflectivity of less than 10%. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the layer is carbon-dominant, with trace amounts of silica and calcium, suggesting the incorporation of environmental dust. The surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated particles ranging from 2 to 25 µm in diameter forming a cohesive, yet friable, crust.

The adhesion of this layer to the native ash surface appears mechanical in nature, with particulate matter deeply embedded within the wood's cellular structure. You can observe significant microfissuring within the crust, a result of differential thermal expansion between the contaminant and the substrate. This cracking creates a network of fine channels, some with widths up to 5 µm, which further trap additional particulate. The overall surface roughness (Ra) is significantly elevated, with preliminary stylus profilometry indicating values in the range of 18–22 µm. This contaminated state represents a substantial barrier, both visually and physically, to the original surface's functional and aesthetic properties.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation, with the laser process successfully ablating the contaminant layer down to the native ash surface. The formerly obscured wood cellular structure is now fully exposed, displaying intact tracheids and vessels with no measurable residual carbon film. Surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 2.5 µm—a nearly 90% decrease—which directly correlates to the restored specular reflectivity, now measured at
