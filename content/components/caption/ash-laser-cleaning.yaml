  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the ash wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows adhesive residues and bonding agents adhering to the surface. The ash exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The ash substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
