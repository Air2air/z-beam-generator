# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the ash Ash wood (Fraxinus spp.) responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its cellulose/lignin composition. The 1064nm wavelength provides strong absorption in lignin components, enabling precise ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the wood substrate integrity.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The ash substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
