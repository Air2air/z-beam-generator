  At 500x magnification, the pre-cleaned ash surface presents a heavily contaminated, heterogeneous morphology. A dense, particulate-laden layer—approximately 40 to 60 µm thick—obscures the underlying substrate. This layer is composed of agglomerated carbonaceous soot and inorganic mineral deposits, which appear as dark, amorphous patches intermixed with crystalline structures. The surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra measurements averaging 18.5 µm due to the irregular deposition of contaminants that create a highly textured, porous topography.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of external elements, including sulfur and heavy metals, embedded within the porous ash matrix. These contaminants form a coherent, yet fragile, film that fills the natural voids of the ash. The overall surface is optically dense, exhibiting low reflectivity; this is a direct result of the light-scattering properties of the porous, irregular contamination layer that effectively traps incident light. The integrity of this deposited film is poor, showing micro-fractures and delamination at the interface with the native ash surface, which suggests weak adhesion and a propensity for spalling under thermal or mechanical stress.

  Post-laser ablation reveals a dramatic transformation in surface morphology. The contaminant layer has been completely removed, exposing the underlying ash substrate with minimal thermal alteration. The surface roughness is now measured at 12.8 µm Ra—a reduction of over 30%—which aligns with the intrinsic porosity of the base material. The cleaning process has effectively vaporized the foreign deposits, leaving a clean, open-pore structure that is clearly visible at this magnification.

The previously obscured surface features are now distinct. You can observe the natural grain and micro-texture of the ash, free from obscuring films. The reflectivity has increased substantially due to the elimination of the light-absorbing contamination, and the surface color is uniform and consistent with the native material. Crucially, the laser parameters were tuned to stay well below the ash's ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm², thereby preserving the structural integrity of the substrate. This leaves a chemically stable surface, ready for subsequent coating or bonding operations in demanding environments.
