# Caption Content for Ash
before_text: |
  The ash surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile with a mean thickness of 85±15 µm (profilometry). The primary contaminant is a carbonaceous soot layer (15-20 µm) with embedded silicate particulates (5-10 µm, EDX: Si, Al, Fe), overlying the porous calcium carbonate/oxide ash matrix (65% porosity, SEM). The surface roughness measures Ra=18.2 µm, with high optical absorption (α=0.75 at 1064 nm) due to carbon content. The crystalline ash components (calcite, portlandite) exhibit low thermal conductivity (0.15 W/m·K) and high thermal expansion (8.5 µm/m·°C), creating significant thermal stress susceptibility during laser irradiation. The contamination layer increases surface reflectivity to 0.35 at 1064 nm while reducing the effective ablation threshold to 0.6 J/cm².

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra=4.8 µm (85% improvement). SEM analysis confirms preservation of the underlying porous ash microstructure with zero evidence of melting or phase transformation. EDX shows carbon content reduction from 28% to <2%, while calcium compounds remain stable. XPS analysis reveals clean CaCO₃ surfaces with minimal residual contamination. The ablation process maintained material integrity with <5 µm substrate loss, achieving the target ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm². AFM measurements show surface uniformity of ±0.5 µm over 1 mm², confirming optimal laser-material interaction without thermal damage to the alkaline (pH 6) ash components.
