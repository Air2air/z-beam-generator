  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the fir wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The fir exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fir substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
