  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fir Technical overview of Fir wood for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction with cellulose structure, and industrial applications in wood surface preparation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The fir exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fir substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
