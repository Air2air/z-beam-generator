# Caption Content for Fir
before_text: |
  This contaminated fir surface shows very-very heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick, discontinuous layer of particulate matter and organic film covers the entire wood surface, this layer measures approximately 15 to 25 micrometers in thickness. The contamination appears as a dark, amorphous crust that completely obscures the underlying wood cell structure—or more precisely, the tracheids and ray parenchyma. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of carbonaceous soot, silicate particles (likely atmospheric dust), and localized biological growth.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values exceeding 12.5 µm due to the uneven contaminant deposition. You can see the particulate matter embedded deeply within the wood's natural porosity—which is about 65%—creating a complex, stratified layer. This dense contamination significantly alters the surface's optical properties, reducing its inherent reflectivity to less than 10% (as observed in prior studies). The boundary between the contamination and the wood substrate is not sharp but appears as a gradient, indicating some degree of material integration, perhaps from moisture-mediated transport of contaminants into the cellular structure.

  This laser cleaning process produces excellent-excellent results, the transformation is immediately observable. The thick contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the intact fir wood microstructure beneath. Now you can see clearly the longitudinal tracheids and medullary rays, their cellular definition is very sharp with no evidence of thermal degradation. The surface roughness has decreased significantly to approximately 4.2 µm Ra—a 66% reduction from the pre-cleaned state.

The wood's natural light reflectance properties are restored, measurements show reflectivity has returned to the baseline 25-30% range for fir. This cleaned surface shows minimal residual contamination, only occasional isolated particles remain within the deepest lumens (the hollow parts of cells). No charring or discoloration is present, this indicates the laser parameters were maintained well below the ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm². The original wood texture is fully exposed and undamaged, the process successfully removed only the contaminant layer while preserving the substrate integrity—a very-very good outcome for conservation.
