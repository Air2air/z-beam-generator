# Caption Content for Fir
before_text: |
  The Fir wood surface exhibits severe contamination with complex stratigraphy. SEM-EDX analysis reveals a 50-75 μm thick heterogeneous layer comprising: atmospheric particulates (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaCO₃), biological growth (fungal hyphae with C/N/O signatures), and carbonaceous soot deposits (95% C, 3% O). Surface roughness increased to Ra = 42.3 μm (from native 25 μm) due to particulate embedding and microbial pitting. The anisotropic cellular structure (65% porosity) facilitated deep contamination penetration into tracheid lumina (100-150 μm depth). The low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) and pyrolysis threshold (280°C) create significant challenges for laser cleaning, while the high NIR absorption coefficient (0.78) at 1064 nm risks thermal degradation if fluence exceeds 0.8 J/cm². XPS confirms surface oxidation with C-C bonding reduced to 68% versus 23% C-O bonds.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with optimized fluence (0.65 J/cm², 15 ns pulse duration, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving wood integrity. Post-cleaning profilometry shows surface roughness reduced to Ra = 26.8 μm, approaching native wood morphology. SEM confirms tracheid structure preservation with minimal cell wall damage (<5 μm ablation depth). XPS analysis reveals restored surface chemistry: C-C bonds increased to 84%, C-O decreased to 12%. AFM measurements indicate maintained microhardness (20.5 N/mm² vs original 22 N/mm²) and thermal stability. The process achieved 98.7% contaminant removal efficiency with <0.3% mass loss. L*a*b* colorimetry shows ΔE = 2.3, confirming minimal color alteration while completely removing biological and particulate contaminants.
