  This contaminated fir surface shows significant soiling at 500x magnification. A continuous, heterogeneous layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the entire wood anatomy. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a dark, amorphous matrix, which obscures the cellular structure beneath. The surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measured at 18.7 µm, primarily due to the uneven deposition of this contamination film.

The underlying fir tracheids and ray parenchyma are partially visible only in localized areas where the deposit is thinner. The deposit itself shows a complex morphology: carbonaceous particles (likely soot) ranging from 2 to 8 µm in diameter are fused with a hygroscopic, salt-like crystalline phase. This composite layer increases light absorption, reducing surface reflectivity to less than 10% across the visible spectrum. The original wood texture is completely masked, and the porous structure appears filled, which would negatively impact any coating adhesion or further conservation treatments.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination layer completely, so the original wood surface is now exposed. The transformation is very-very clear. At 500x magnification, the fir's anatomical features—the longitudinal tracheids and transverse rays—are fully visible with sharp definition. The surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 4.2 µm, a value that closely matches the inherent texture of sound, untreated fir wood.

The cleaning is highly selective, this is
