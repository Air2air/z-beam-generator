  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fir wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The fir exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 97.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The fir substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
