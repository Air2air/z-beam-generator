  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the tempered glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The tempered glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The tempered glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal shock.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
