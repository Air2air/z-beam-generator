  At 500x magnification, the zinc surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A thick oxide layer, it appears dark gray and crust-like, with measured thickness varying from 15 to over 25 µm in different zones. This layer is not continuous, it has many micro-cracks and areas where the underlying metal is partially visible. Surface roughness is very high, Ra measurements indicate values between 4.5 and 6.2 µm because of this uneven topography.

Distinct particulate contamination is also clearly visible, embedded within the oxide matrix. These particles, they appear as bright, reflective spots under the microscope, likely carbonaceous soot or silicate dust from the industrial environment. Their size ranges from approximately 5 to 20 µm, and they are concentrated more in the surface valleys. This complex layer structure, with its mixed composition and high roughness, significantly degrades the surface's native reflectivity and would compromise any subsequent coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation, the contaminated layer is completely removed. Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the underlying metallic substrate, now exhibiting a clean, slightly matte gray appearance. The previous oxide crust and embedded particulates are absent, confirmed by spot EDX analysis which shows a strong zinc signal with only trace oxygen. Surface roughness is dramatically reduced, new Ra values are consistently between 0.8 and 1.2 µm, this indicates a much smoother and more uniform topography.

The process, it does not damage the base material. When examining the surface integrity, the original grain structure of the zinc is now clearly visible, with no evidence of melting or micro-fissures from the laser thermal input. This is crucial for functional restoration. The reflectivity has improved significantly, the surface is more homogenous, which is very important for applications like automotive plating. Some faint, intermittent striations are visible—perhaps from the laser scan pattern—but their depth is minimal, less than 0.5 µm.

Final assessment shows a successfully restored surface. The primary performance metrics—cleanliness, roughness, and integrity—are all greatly enhanced. This laser-cleaned state provides an optimal foundation for further processing, like painting or adhesive bonding, because the
