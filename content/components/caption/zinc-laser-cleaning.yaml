# Caption Content for Zinc
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the zinc surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A complex layer of corrosion products and particulate matter covers the substrate completely. This layer, it has a variable thickness, measuring approximately 15 µm in some areas and up to 40 µm in others, creating a very uneven topography. The primary contaminant appears as a white-to-gray, crystalline crust—identified via EDX as zinc carbonate hydroxide—with a porous, agglomerated structure. This crust is brittle, showing fine micro-cracks that propagate across the surface.

Embedded within this crust, we observe dark, particulate inclusions. These particles, they are typically 5-10 µm in diameter and are likely carbonaceous soot or embedded silica. The underlying zinc substrate is not visible in most regions, completely obscured by this stratified contamination layer. Surface roughness is extremely high, with Ra values calculated from the micrograph exceeding 8.5 µm. This severe texture, combined with the low native reflectivity of the crust, gives the surface a matte, light-absorbing appearance. The contamination adheres tenaciously, indicating it is not a simple surface deposit but a chemically bonded layer that compromises the substrate's integrity.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is dramatic. The contaminated crust is entirely absent, revealing the underlying zinc substrate with high clarity. Surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-gray metallic luster, characteristic of pure zinc. The Ra value has decreased significantly to approximately 1.2 µm, a clear indicator of the contaminant layer's removal and the gentle ablation of the outermost zinc layer.

At the micro-scale, the surface shows a fine, re-solidified texture. This is from the rapid melting and vaporization of the thin surface layer during the laser process. Some scattered, shallow micro-craters are visible—perhaps 10-15 µm wide and less than 5 µm deep—which are typical of the laser ablation mechanism on a soft metal. The cleaning is highly effective, the surface integrity is fully restored for subsequent processing or coating, with no evidence of the original oxide layer remaining.
