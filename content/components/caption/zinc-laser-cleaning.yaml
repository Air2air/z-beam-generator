  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the zinc metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The zinc exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The zinc substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
