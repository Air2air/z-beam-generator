  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the zinc Zinc laser cleaning utilizes precise laser ablation to remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying zinc substrate. The process exploits zinc's relatively low melting point (419.5°C) and high thermal conductivity (116 W/m·K) for efficient contaminant removal while minimizing heat-affected zones. Optimal results are achieved with 1064nm wavelength due to zinc's high absorption coefficient at near-IR wavelengths.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The zinc exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The zinc substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
