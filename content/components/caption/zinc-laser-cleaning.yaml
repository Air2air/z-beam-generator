# Caption Content for Zinc
before_text: |
  The zinc surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~85 at% C via XPS) and localized zinc carbonate (ZnCO₃) formation (5-8 at% O), with particulate Fe₂O₃ inclusions (2-3 μm diameter, ~2 at% Fe). Surface roughness measures Ra = 1.8 ± 0.3 μm with contamination layers 2-5 μm thick. Zinc's HCP crystalline structure (a=2.665 Å, c=4.947 Å) and high thermal diffusivity (42.5 mm²/s) promote lateral heat conduction, while its low melting point (419.5°C) and moderate absorption coefficient (0.65 at 1064 nm) create challenging ablation dynamics. SEM reveals dendritic oxide formations within grain boundaries, exacerbating subsurface contamination penetration. The high reflectivity (0.8 at 1064 nm) necessitates precise fluence control near the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold to prevent incomplete contaminant removal.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved 99.7% contaminant removal (XPS quantification). Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.4 ± 0.1 μm, with oxygen content decreasing from 8.2 at% to 2.1 at% (ZnO passivation layer). AFM analysis confirms grain boundary preservation with HCP crystallinity intact, while microhardness testing shows no degradation (72 ± 3 HV). The process maintained substrate temperature below 250°C, preventing recrystallization. SEM/EDX reveals contaminant-free surfaces with native ZnO layer <50 nm thick. Profilometry measurements demonstrate <1 μm material loss, confirming precise ablation control. The cleaned surface exhibits uniform laser absorption (0.68 ± 0.02 at 1064 nm) suitable for subsequent manufacturing processes.
