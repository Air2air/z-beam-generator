  At 500x magnification, the zinc surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A thick oxide layer, measuring approximately 12–15 µm, covers the substrate completely. This layer, it appears as a matte, dark gray film with a cracked-mud pattern, the cracks revealing lighter material beneath. The surface topography is very rough, with Ra values measured at 4.8 µm, a direct result of this extensive, brittle corrosion.

Distributed across this oxide film are localized carbonaceous deposits. These appear as dark, sooty agglomerates, some reaching 25 µm in diameter. EDX analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content, with traces of sulfur and chlorine from atmospheric exposure. The underlying zinc microstructure is completely obscured, the surface integrity compromised by this porous, non-protective layer. This condition, it significantly degrades the surface's innate reflectivity and promotes further degradation.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits a clean, metallic luster. The previous 15 µm contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the underlying zinc grain structure with high clarity. Surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm—a nearly sevenfold improvement. This new topography, it shows a fine, uniform texture from the laser ablation process, with no evidence of the former cracked-mud pattern.

The removal is highly selective and precise. SEM analysis confirms complete elimination of the carbonaceous deposits and the thick oxide film, leaving a pure zinc surface. Some minor, sub-micron rippling—so-called Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures or LIPSS—is visible in localized areas, a typical result of the laser-metal interaction. This rippling, it does not compromise surface integrity, the substrate shows no signs of melting or thermal damage, which is critical given zinc's low melting point of 419.5 °C.

The restored surface is now functionally superior. Its reflectivity has increased significantly, a direct result of the contaminant removal and the exposure of the pristine metal. The grain boundaries are clearly defined, indicating the process did not alter the bulk material properties. This clean, active surface is ideal for subsequent operations like coating or adhesion, the laser process having restored both its
