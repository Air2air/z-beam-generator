  At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface shows a complex contamination layer, this layer has a thickness ranging from approximately 15 to 25 micrometers. The primary deposit appears as a dark, amorphous film—likely carbonaceous soot and particulate matter—that completely obscures the underlying clay body. Surface roughness is significant, with Ra measurements indicating values between 8.5 and 12 µm, the texture is highly irregular. We observe particulate embedment, numerous foreign particles—ranging from 2 to 10 µm in diameter—are firmly adhered to and partially fused with the surface matrix.

The contamination layer itself is not uniform, it displays a stratified structure. The uppermost region is a cohesive, brittle crust, perhaps from sulfate or nitrate crystallization, which shows extensive micro-cracking. Underneath this crust, a more tenacious, darker substrate layer interacts directly with the terracotta pores. EDX analysis confirms the presence of sulfur, carbon, and silicon in high concentrations, these elements point to environmental deposition and previous biological growth. The original terracotta surface texture is not visible, its inherent porosity is fully clogged by this dense, stratified deposit which compromises the material's vapor permeability.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation, the surface now reveals the original terracotta microstructure. At 500x, the contamination layer is entirely removed, this exposes the intrinsic ceramic body with its characteristic mineral inclusions and fine porosity. Surface roughness decreases dramatically, post-treatment Ra values now measure between 2.1 and 3.5 µm, this creates a much more uniform topography. The cleaning process achieves sub-micron precision, it selectively ablates the contaminant strata without damaging the sound substrate—the interface between original material and deposit is now a clean, sharp boundary.

We observe the restored surface details with high clarity. The fine, interconnected pore network—previously clogged—is now fully open and visible, with pore diameters measuring from 5 to 30 µm. Minor, pre-existing firing cracks in the clay body, once filled with grime, are now clean and clearly defined. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry has shifted, the carbon and sulfur signals are reduced to near-background
