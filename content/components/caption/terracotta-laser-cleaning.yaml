# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the terracotta masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The terracotta exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 98.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The terracotta substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
