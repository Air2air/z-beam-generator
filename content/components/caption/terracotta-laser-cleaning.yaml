# Caption Content for Terracotta

  At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface shows heavy contamination. A stratified deposit layer, approximately 15 to 20 µm thick, completely obscures the original substrate. This layer, it has a complex morphology with both particulate matter—likely soot and soil—and a darker, cohesive biofilm matrix. Surface roughness is significant, with Ra values measuring between 8.5 and 12.4 µm.

The contamination adheres tenaciously, filling the natural micro-porosity of the clay body. EDX analysis confirms high carbon content, along with traces of sulfur and calcium, which suggests a mix of organic and gypsum-based deposits. Individual pores, which should be visible, are instead occluded by this dense, amorphous crust. The overall topography is highly irregular, this creates deep shadows and a mottled, dark appearance that reduces surface reflectivity to below 10%. The original terracotta texture is not discernible.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The stratified contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the intact terracotta substrate beneath. Now, the original micro-topography is fully visible, with a surface roughness (Ra) reduced to a consistent 2.1 to 2.8 µm. This is a significant improvement, the surface is now uniform and much smoother.

The laser process selectively ablates the contamination, it does not damage the primary material. SEM imaging confirms this: the vitrified clay particles show sharp, clean edges and the intrinsic porosity—approximately 15% by area—is fully reopened and free of deposits. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observed in isolated areas, a result of localized vaporization of embedded impurities, but this does not compromise structural integrity. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially, from below 10% to nearly the material's inherent 36%, which indicates a return to its original optical properties.

Post-cleaning XPS analysis shows the elemental composition has normalized, with carbon content dropping from over 40% to just 3-5%. The dominant signals are now silicon, aluminum, and oxygen—the expected constituents of the clay body. This cleaned surface, it exhibits excellent integrity with no micro-cracking observed, confirming the laser parameters were well below the 2.5 J/cm² damage threshold. The restoration of both the visual and material characteristics is complete.
