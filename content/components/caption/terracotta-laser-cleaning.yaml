# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the terracotta Terracotta laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the fragile clay matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the iron-rich clay body, with optimal results achieved at near-infrared wavelengths where terracotta exhibits lower absorption coefficients than most surface deposits.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows construction residues and atmospheric deposits adhering to the surface. The terracotta exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The terracotta substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
