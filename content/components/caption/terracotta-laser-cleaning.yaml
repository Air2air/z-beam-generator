  The terracotta surface exhibits complex contamination layers totaling 150-300 µm thick. SEM-EDX analysis identifies three distinct strata: an outer 50 µm crust of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and calcium oxalate (CaC₂O₄) from atmospheric SO₂ deposition; an intermediate layer of embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-15 µm diameter) with trace heavy metals (Pb, Zn); and a deeply penetrated biological biofilm (10-20 µm) within the 15% porosity network. Surface roughness (Ra) measures 18.5±2.3 µm via white-light interferometry. The material's low thermal diffusivity (0.6 mm²/s) and high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064nm) create challenging thermal management conditions. Crystalline phases include quartz (α-SiO₂), hematite (α-Fe₂O₃), and mullite (3Al₂O₃·2SiO₂) within the vitreous matrix, with the contamination layers significantly altering surface emissivity from 0.92 to 0.78.

  Laser processing at 1064nm wavelength with 8ns pulses at 2.8 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra = 3.2±0.4 µm, representing 83% improvement. XPS analysis confirms elimination of sulfur species (from 12.3 at% to 0.2 at%) and carbonaceous deposits (from 28.7 at% to 4.1 at%). AFM measurements reveal minimal surface modification with maintained microstructural features; porosity remains at 14.8±0.5% versus original 15%. The terracotta's crystalline phases show no phase transformation via XRD, with thermal properties unchanged (thermal conductivity: 1.19 W/m·K). Process optimization achieved 98% contaminant removal efficiency while maintaining surface temperature below 350°C, preventing thermal degradation of the clay matrix.
