  At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface shows heavy, stratified contamination. A dense, heterogeneous layer—composed primarily of carbonaceous soot and gypsum deposits—covers the entire substrate. This layer has a variable thickness, measuring from approximately 15 to 25 µm, and it completely obscures the underlying ceramic body. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra values exceeding 12 µm, due to the agglomeration of particulate matter and the formation of hard, crystalline crusts. EDX analysis confirms the presence of sulfur and carbon, which is consistent with atmospheric deposition.

The contamination layer itself is not uniform, it exhibits significant cracking and delamination. You can see micro-fissures propagating through the crust, likely from differential thermal expansion with the terracotta substrate. In some areas, biological growth appears as a fibrous, dendritic network, further penetrating the porous structure. The original terracotta surface is not visible, its color and granularity entirely masked by this dark, cohesive film that reduces surface reflectivity to below 10%. This level of coverage severely compromises the material's aesthetic and physical integrity.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation, the original terracotta substrate is now fully exposed. At 500x, the surface reveals a fine-grained, sintered ceramic microstructure with a characteristic orange-red coloration. The previous contamination layer has been completely removed, this is evident from the absence of sulfur and carbon peaks in subsequent EDX scans. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 2.8 µm, a value that aligns closely with the material's inherent, post-firing texture.

The cleaning process has restored surface reflectivity to approximately 32%, which is near the material's baseline. You can observe the intrinsic porosity of the terracotta—a network of fine, open pores measuring 5-20 µm in diameter, now free of infill. No thermal damage is apparent; the laser parameters were precisely controlled below the ablation threshold to prevent vitrification or micro-fracturing. The surface integrity is fully maintained, with the original manufacturing marks and mineral inclusions clearly visible again.

This result demonstrates a highly selective ablation process. The laser energy was effectively absorbed
