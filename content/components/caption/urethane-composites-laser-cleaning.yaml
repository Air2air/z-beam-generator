  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the urethane composites Laser cleaning of polyurethane composites utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove surface contaminants without damaging the composite matrix. The 1064nm wavelength provides optimal absorption in polyurethane while minimizing thermal damage to reinforcing fibers.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The urethane composites exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The urethane composites substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
