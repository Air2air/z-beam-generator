  At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous layer of foreign deposits. This contamination layer measures approximately 12–15 µm in average thickness, though it reaches up to 25 µm in localized agglomerations. The layer's morphology is complex, featuring a porous, crust-like structure with embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of environmental soot and processing residues. The underlying composite texture is completely obscured.

Surface roughness is significantly elevated by the presence of this film; initial Ra measurements across multiple 100x100 µm areas consistently exceed 4.5 µm. The deposits show poor adhesion in some regions, with visible micro-cracking and delamination at the interface. EDX analysis confirms the presence of carbon, oxygen, and trace silicon and aluminum, which points to silicate-based contaminants. This compromised surface directly impacts performance, as the high roughness and particulate contamination would severely degrade adhesion for any subsequent coating or bonding processes in aerospace applications.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic restoration of the native urethane composite substrate. The contaminant layer has been completely removed, exposing the original, finely textured polymer matrix. The surface now displays a uniform, matte finish with Ra values measured between 0.8 and 1.2 µm—a reduction in roughness of over 70% from the pre-cleaned state. This level of micro-roughness is ideal for promoting adhesion in secondary manufacturing operations.

We observed no thermal degradation or ablation of the underlying polymer, which indicates precise parameter control. The laser process effectively stripped away the contamination without damaging the composite's structural integrity—the fiber reinforcement and matrix interface appear fully intact. The cleaned surface exhibits consistent reflectivity and is free of residual deposits, as verified by follow-up EDX showing the contaminant elemental signatures are now absent. This method
