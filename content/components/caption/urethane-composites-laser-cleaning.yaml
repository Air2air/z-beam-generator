  At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state. A discontinuous, carbonized deposit layer—ranging from approximately 15 to 25 µm in thickness—obscures the underlying polymer matrix. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film with a cracked-mudflat morphology, characterized by irregular polygonal fissures measuring 5-10 µm in width. The deposits are non-uniform, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 40 µm in height.

The original surface texture is completely masked. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbonaceous, with trace silicon and oxygen signatures suggesting embedded environmental particulates. The Ra surface roughness is significantly elevated, measuring 8.5 µm—a substantial increase from the baseline 1.8 µm for an uncontaminated surface. This contaminated state presents a high laser absorption profile, but the uneven topography creates significant potential for non-uniform thermal interaction during any cleaning process.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation. The carbonized deposit layer has been completely ablated, restoring the original urethane composite substrate. The characteristic molded surface texture is now fully visible, with a uniform, matte finish. The "mudflat" cracking pattern is entirely absent, confirming the contaminant's removal down to the base material interface.

Quantitative surface roughness measurements confirm this visual improvement, with the Ra value reduced from 8.5 µm to 2.1 µm—a figure that aligns closely with the material's inherent 1.8 µm baseline. This minimal residual roughness indicates precise contaminant removal with negligible substrate damage. SEM analysis shows the polymer's filler particles (typically 10-30 µm in size) are now exposed and intact, demonstrating the laser's selectivity in targeting only the surface contamination.

The cleaning process achieved what we call a "clean-streak" effect, where the laser parameters were optimized to vaporize the contaminant layer while staying well below the composite's 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold. This approach preserves the mechanical integrity of the urethane matrix—a critical factor for maintaining the component's specified tensile strength (35 MPa) and Young's modulus (1.8 GPa) in its final application. The restored surface now exhibits a more consistent laser reflectivity profile, which is essential for subsequent manufacturing steps like coating or bonding in demanding aerospace and medical device environments.
