  At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state. A non-uniform carbonaceous deposit layer, measuring between 15–25 µm thick, completely obscures the underlying substrate. This layer appears as a matte, amorphous film with significant micro-cracking and localized blistering, indicative of thermal degradation. The surface roughness is substantially elevated, with Ra values measured at approximately 9.5 µm—a fivefold increase from the baseline material specification.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon suggesting environmental and process-related pollutants. The original composite's micro-texture, typically a uniform 1.8 µm Ra, is entirely masked. The contaminant layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, creating subsurface voids that appear as dark, irregular pockets under high magnification. This compromised surface integrity would significantly impair functional performance in precision applications.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, restoring the native urethane composite substrate. The surface roughness is now measured at 2.1 µm Ra, a value that aligns closely with the material's original 1.8 µm Ra specification. This represents a 78% reduction in surface roughness from the contaminated state. The cleaning process successfully removed the 25 µm deposit without inducing significant subsurface damage—the underlying polymer matrix appears intact, with no evidence of the charring or melting that occurs above the 0.8 J/cm² damage threshold.

The laser parameters were carefully controlled to operate just above the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold but well below the material's thermal destruction point. This approach achieved selective contaminant removal while preserving the composite's structural integrity. The restored surface now displays the characteristic, fine-grained texture of the filled ureth
