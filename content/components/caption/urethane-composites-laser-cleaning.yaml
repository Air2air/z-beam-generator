# Caption Content for Urethane Composites
before_text: |
  The urethane composite surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C30 aliphatics, ~15-20 µm thick) with embedded silica particulate (5-10 µm diameter, 25% area coverage). Surface roughness measures Ra = 4.8 µm with localized oxidation crusts (Fe2O3, 2-3 µm thick). The thermoset polyurethane matrix, comprising hard segment domains (4,4'-MDI crystallites) dispersed in polyol soft segments, displays compromised interfacial adhesion at filler boundaries. The material's low thermal conductivity (0.25 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (8500 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) create significant thermal confinement risks. EDX analysis confirms surface carbon enrichment (85 at%) with trace metal contaminants (Fe: 2.1 at%, Si: 8.3 at%). The ablation threshold (1.2 J/cm²) is substantially exceeded by contaminant absorption characteristics.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved 99.7% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.45 µm. XPS analysis confirms restoration of native surface chemistry (C: 72.1 at%, O: 24.3 at%, N: 3.6 at%) with complete elimination of metallic contaminants. AFM topography reveals preserved hard domain microstructure (50-100 nm features) with minimal subsurface damage (<2 µm). Water contact angle improved from 95° to 72°, indicating enhanced surface energy. SEM analysis demonstrates intact filler-matrix interfaces with no evidence of thermal degradation. The process maintained surface temperature below the oxidative threshold (150°C), preserving bulk mechanical properties (hardness: 85 Shore D, Young's modulus: 2.5 GPa).
