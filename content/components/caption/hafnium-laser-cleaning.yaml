# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the hafnium Hafnium laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove surface contaminants and oxides from hafnium components without damaging the substrate. The process leverages hafnium's high melting point (2233°C) and specific absorption characteristics at 1064nm wavelength for precise material processing.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The hafnium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The hafnium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
