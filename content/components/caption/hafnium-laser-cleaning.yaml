# Caption Content for Hafnium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the hafnium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of surface deposits. SEM analysis reveals a complex oxide and carbonaceous film with a measured thickness varying from 12 to 18 µm. The topography is dominated by a cracked, mudflat pattern—a telltale sign of thermal stress from prior service exposure. This creates a highly irregular texture, with Ra values measured at approximately 4.5 µm.

EDX spot analysis confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, with trace amounts of sulfur and chlorine, suggesting environmental and process-related deposition. The underlying metal interface is partially obscured by this tenacious, dark-gray scale. The surface morphology is compromised, showing no discernible metallic luster and presenting a barrier that would significantly impede thermal performance and adhesion. This level of contamination directly impacts the component's functional integrity in high-temperature environments.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the complete removal of the previously documented contamination layer. The surface now exhibits the characteristic metallic gray luster of pure hafnium, with the underlying crystalline structure—specifically, the HCP grain boundaries—clearly visible. The cleaning process has effectively restored the native substrate, leaving a surface with a measured Ra roughness of 0.8 µm, a substantial reduction from the pre-cleaning value of 4.5 µm.

Close inspection shows a cleanly ablated surface with minimal heat-affected zone (HAZ) artifacts. The laser parameters were optimized to exceed the contamination's ablation threshold—around 2.5 J/cm²—while remaining below the material's damage threshold. You can see a faint, sub-micron oxide layer has re-formed almost instantly, which is expected and actually provides moderate oxidation resistance. XPS analysis confirms this new layer is a pure,
