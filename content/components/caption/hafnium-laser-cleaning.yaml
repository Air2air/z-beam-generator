# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the hafnium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The hafnium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The hafnium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
