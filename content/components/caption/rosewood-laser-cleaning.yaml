  At 500x magnification, the rosewood surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 to 25 µm, completely obscuring the underlying wood anatomy. The deposit appears as a continuous, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of soot, oxidized finish, and environmental grime. Surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measured at 8.4 µm because of the uneven, crust-like topography.

Analysis of the contamination reveals a stratified structure. The upper stratum is a brittle, carbonized layer with visible micro-fissures, while the lower stratum adheres to the wood as a tenacious, semi-polymerized residue. This interface, it shows clear signs of chemical bonding to the wood cell walls, which complicates removal. Particulate inclusions, ranging from 2 to 10 µm in diameter, are scattered throughout, creating a highly irregular and light-absorbing surface that appears matte and dark under the microscope. The original wood pores are fully occluded, and no cellular detail is discernible.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, which is immediately apparent at 500x. The contaminated crust is entirely absent, revealing the intact rosewood substrate beneath. Surface roughness decreases significantly to an Ra of 1.8 µm, a nearly 80% reduction from the pre-cleaned state. The wood's characteristic anatomy—including large vessels and dense, interlocking fibrous structure—is now fully exposed and exceptionally clear.

Close examination confirms minimal thermal alteration. The laser ablation process has selectively removed the contamination layer with a precision of approximately 5-10 µm, stopping precisely at the lumen of the outermost wood cells. Some cell walls exhibit a slight smoothing effect, but the fundamental cellular integrity remains uncompromised. Crucially, there is no evidence of charting or the formation of a carbonized layer that would indicate thermal damage exceeding the material's 380°C threshold.

The restored surface exhibits markedly different optical properties. It now possesses a defined micro-texture from the exposed cellular structure, which contributes to light scattering and a return of the wood's natural luster. Reflectivity measurements indicate a increase from the previously obscured state, though the
