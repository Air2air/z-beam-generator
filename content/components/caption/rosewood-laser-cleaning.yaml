# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the rosewood wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The rosewood exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 98.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The rosewood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
