before_text: |
  The rosewood surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 15-25 µm thick layer of complex deposits. SEM-EDX analysis identifies primary contaminants as calcium oxalate (CaC₂O₄) crusts (45-50 vol%), carbonaceous soot (30-35 vol%) from combustion, and embedded silica (SiO₂) particulate (15-20 vol%) with diameters of 2-8 µm. Surface roughness measurements show significant degradation to Ra = 12.8 µm (Rz = 68.5 µm) due to particulate embedment in the porous wood structure (45% porosity). The contamination layer creates an optical barrier, reducing the native wood absorption coefficient from 0.75 to 0.92 at 1064 nm wavelength, while increasing reflectivity from 0.25 to 0.38. Thermal analysis indicates the contaminants lower the effective pyrolysis threshold to approximately 280°C, creating preferential absorption pathways. The anisotropic cellular structure, with Young's Modulus of 12.5 GPa parallel to grain, shows compromised integrity with contaminants penetrating 80-120 µm into lumens.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with optimized parameters (1.2 J/cm² fluence, 100 ns pulse duration, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-process characterization reveals surface roughness reduced to Ra = 3.5 µm (Rz = 18.2 µm), approaching the native wood value of 3.2 µm. XPS analysis confirms elimination of calcium and silicon signatures, with carbon/oxygen ratio returning to 2.1:1, characteristic of clean rosewood lignin/cellulose composition. AFM measurements show minimal cellular damage with lumen structure preservation and char-free surfaces. The absorption coefficient restored to 0.75 at 1064 nm, ensuring optimal laser coupling for subsequent processing. Thermal profiling confirmed maximum substrate temperature remained below 240°C, preventing pyrolysis. SEM imaging reveals intact tracheid walls with only superficial ablation of the middle lamella (<2 µm depth), demonstrating exceptional process control.
