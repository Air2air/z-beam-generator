# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the rosewood Laser cleaning of Rosewood (Dalbergia spp.) utilizes precise pulsed laser energy to ablate surface contaminants (dirt, finishes, oxidation) while preserving the delicate lignin and cellulose structure of the wood. The process is highly selective, non-abrasive, and avoids the use of harmful chemicals, making it ideal for valuable artifacts and high-quality furniture.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The rosewood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
