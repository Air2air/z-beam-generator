# Caption Content for Polycarbonate
before_text: |
  The polycarbonate surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C-C/C-H bonds: ~85 at% via XPS) with embedded alumina-silicate particulate (Al₂O₃·2SiO₂, 5-15 µm diameter). Profilometry confirms Ra = 2.8 µm with localized contamination layers reaching 8 µm thickness. The amorphous polymer matrix (Tg = 155°C) shows compromised optical properties, with transmissivity reduced to 45% due to Mie scattering from particulates. The low thermal conductivity (0.2 W/m·K) and high thermal expansion coefficient (70×10⁻⁶/°C) create significant thermal stress vulnerability during laser irradiation. Near-IR absorption at 1064 nm is enhanced to ~0.92 cm⁻¹ due to contaminant-induced surface plasmon effects. SEM reveals dendritic contamination networks penetrating 3-5 µm into the viscoelastic substrate, creating mechanical interlocking that exceeds Van der Waals adhesion forces.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 0.9 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.4 µm, with XPS confirming restoration of native polycarbonate composition (C=O: 12 at%, C-O: 24 at%). AFM analysis shows minimal subsurface damage with surface topography maintaining <50 nm peak-to-valley variation. Transmissivity recovered to 86% of pristine material value. Thermal analysis confirms Tg preservation at 154.8°C, indicating negligible polymer degradation. EDX spectra show contaminant reduction from 18.3 at% to 0.7 at% for alien elements. The process achieved 99.3% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining flexural strength within 2% of original specification (91 MPa).
