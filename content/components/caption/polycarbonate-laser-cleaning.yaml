  At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface shows heavy contamination. A dense, particulate-laden film covers the entire substrate, with an estimated thickness of 15 to 20 micrometers. This layer appears amorphous and sooty, completely obscuring the original polymer texture. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous soot and silicate particles—likely from environmental exposure or prior thermal degradation.

Surface topography is severely compromised. The contamination layer exhibits significant cracking, with fissures measuring up to 5 µm wide, revealing a loosely adhered, granular structure beneath. The original surface roughness, typically around 0.02 µm Ra for molded polycarbonate, is now completely masked. Instead, we observe a very irregular, agglomerated texture with Ra values exceeding 2.5 µm. This degraded state would severely impact optical clarity and promote further contamination adhesion, a critical concern for aerospace and medical applications where surface integrity is paramount. The low thermal conductivity of polycarbonate—only 0.2 W/m·K—likely contributed to localized overheating that baked this contamination onto the surface.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, very clear under 500x magnification. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine polycarbonate substrate beneath. Surface roughness measurements now register at 0.18 µm Ra—a significant improvement from the previous 2.5 µm and much closer to the native 0.02 µm Ra of virgin material. The surface appears uniform, with the characteristic smooth, amorphous microstructure of polycarbonate fully restored.

No evidence of the former carbonaceous film remains. The laser process has effectively ablated the contamination layer without reaching the material's ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm², which is a precise operation. Some minor, sub-micrometer texturing is visible—a direct result of the laser interaction with the polymer—but this micro-roughness is actually beneficial for adhesion in subsequent coating processes. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially because the contaminant film is gone, restoring the material's inherent optical properties. This level of precision is crucial for automotive and medical device applications where both surface purity and dimensional stability are non-
