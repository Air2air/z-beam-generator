  At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm, completely obscuring the original polymer substrate. The contamination appears as a dense, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of organic deposits and inorganic dust from the operational environment. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 3.8 µm, this creates a visibly matte and occluded appearance.

The film itself shows a complex structure. Under the microscope, we see a stratified morphology with a brittle, carbonized upper crust and a more tenacious, greasy underlayer adhering directly to the polycarbonate. Particulate contaminants, they are clearly visible as discrete islands—some reaching 20 µm in diameter—and EDX analysis confirms compositions rich in silica and calcium. The underlying polycarbonate texture is not discernible, its surface integrity completely compromised by this pervasive coating which exhibits extensive micro-cracking. This level of fouling, it would severely impact optical clarity and compromise any functional coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the native polycarbonate surface with its characteristic smooth, glassy texture. Now the surface roughness is dramatically reduced to an Ra of 0.4 µm—precisely 0.42 µm in three separate measurements. This represents nearly a 90% decrease, a very significant improvement for adhesion and light transmission. The cleaning process, it has selectively ablated only the contamination, the base material shows no evidence of melting or thermal degradation.

When examining the surface details, the original manufacturing marks—fine, parallel striations from the molding process—are now perfectly visible. No particulate islands remain. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry has been restored to pure polycarbonate, with carbon and oxygen peaks dominant and all foreign elemental signatures eliminated. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observable in isolated areas, a typical result of varying contaminant adhesion, but the overall surface integrity is excellent. This restored state provides an ideal foundation for subsequent processing, the reflectivity and surface energy now meeting specifications for high-performance applications.
