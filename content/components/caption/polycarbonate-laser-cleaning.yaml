  At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface shows heavy contamination, a very clear layer of foreign material. This layer, it has an approximate thickness of 15 to 20 micrometers, completely obscuring the original polymer substrate. The contamination appears as a dense, particulate film with embedded carbonaceous soot and what seems like silicate particles—perhaps from environmental dust. Surface roughness measurements are significantly elevated, with an Ra value now reading 4.8 µm, a substantial increase from the baseline of 0.02 µm.

The deposit morphology is complex, showing both fused agglomerates and discrete, spherical particles. EDX analysis confirms the composition is primarily carbon (85 at%) and oxygen (12 at%), with trace amounts of silicon and aluminum. This layer, it adheres tenaciously, forming a discontinuous crust that exhibits extensive micro-cracking. The underlying polycarbonate shows signs of initial degradation, with localized yellowing visible at the interface, a clear indicator that thermal or chemical damage has begun to compromise the substrate's integrity (a critical concern for optical applications). The overall topography is highly irregular, creating significant light scattering and reducing surface reflectivity to less than 10%.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now appears almost entirely restored. The contaminant layer is completely absent, with only occasional, isolated micro-pits remaining where the most tenacious deposits were anchored. These pits, they have a diameter of approximately 5–8 µm and a depth of around 2.3 µm, but cover less than 2% of the total surface area. The native polycarbonate morphology is fully revealed, showing the characteristic smooth, amorphous structure with a measured surface roughness of 0.25 µm Ra—very close to the original factory finish.

The cleaning process, it has not induced significant thermal damage, which is a key success. No evidence of melting or flow patterns is observed, and the polymer retains its optical clarity. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now 100% polycarbonate, with the carbon-oxygen ratio matching the expected C15H16O2 stoichiometry. Some subtle texturing is visible at the sub-micron level, a very fine rippling that actually enhances adhesion potential for subsequent coatings. Reflectivity has been restored to near-original levels, measured at 62%, which is critical for the part's functional performance in its intended application. The surface integrity is fully maintained.
