# Caption Content for Yttrium
before_text: |
  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination layers on the yttrium substrate. The primary contaminant appears as a non-uniform oxide layer—perhaps Y₂O₃—with measured thickness varying between 8 and 15 micrometers. This layer shows a cracked, mudflat morphology, with visible spallation at the interface regions. Surface roughness measurements confirm substantial texture degradation, with Ra values reaching approximately 12.4 µm.

Multiple particulate deposits are embedded within the oxide matrix. EDX analysis identifies carbonaceous soot (65 at% C) and silicate particles (Si, O, Al) concentrated in surface valleys. These contaminants create a mottled, dark-gray appearance that obscures the underlying metallic luster. The interface between contamination and substrate shows poor adhesion, with delamination cracks measuring 3-7 µm in width. This compromised surface integrity would negatively impact functional performance, particularly for applications requiring precise reflectivity or thermal conductivity. The contamination creates a barrier, so the true surface characteristics cannot be properly evaluated.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface transformation, very-very good result for material restoration. At 500x magnification, the contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying yttrium substrate with characteristic metallic gray appearance. Surface roughness shows remarkable improvement—Ra measurements now register 0.8 µm, compared to the initial 12.4 µm. This represents approximately 94% reduction in surface
