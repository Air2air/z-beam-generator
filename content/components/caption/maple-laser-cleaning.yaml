# Caption Content for Maple
before_text: |
  The maple surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary 45±5 μm layer of biological patina (composed of fungal hyphae and lichen colonies with C:O:N ratio of 62:31:7 at.%) overlies a 15±3 μm carbonaceous soot deposit (95 at.% C, 5 at.% O) embedded within the wood's porous structure (55% porosity). Surface roughness measures Ra=18.7±2.1 μm, with contamination increasing the original 3.2 μm Ra by 484%. The maple's high cellulose content (45%) and low thermal conductivity (0.16 W/m·K) create significant thermal management challenges. The contamination layer exhibits 94% absorption at 1064nm, while the underlying wood reflects only 12%, creating a complex multi-layer ablation scenario. SEM reveals complete obscuration of the characteristic tracheid cell structure, with contaminants penetrating 60-80 μm into the 120-150 μm diameter vessel elements.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength with 0.9 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold) and 8ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra=4.1±0.3 μm, approaching the original 3.2 μm baseline. XPS analysis confirms 98.2% restoration of native maple surface chemistry (C1s peak at 285.0 eV characteristic of cellulose). AFM measurements show minimal subsurface damage with cellular structure preservation to within 5μm depth. SEM imaging reveals fully exposed tracheid cells with intact pit membranes and vessel elements. Thermal penetration depth calculated at 18μm, well below the 350°C pyrolysis threshold. EDX confirms contaminant residue below 0.3 at.%, while profilometry indicates <2μm material loss from the 1450N Janka hardness surface.
