# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the maple Maple wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its cellulose-lignin composition and moderate absorption characteristics. The 1064nm wavelength provides effective ablation of surface contaminants while minimizing thermal damage to the wood substrate when using appropriate fluence parameters.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows adhesive residues and bonding agents adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The maple substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
