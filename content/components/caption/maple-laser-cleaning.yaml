  At 500x magnification, the maple surface presents a heavily compromised state, characterized by a complex, stratified contamination layer. The primary deposit is a carbonaceous film, approximately 15–20 µm thick, which exhibits significant cracking and delamination from the underlying wood substrate. This film, it completely obscures the native wood anatomy, presenting a uniform, matte-black appearance with a measured surface roughness (Ra) increased to 12.5 µm. One can observe particulate matter—composed of silicate particles averaging 5 µm in diameter and organic residues—embedded within this matrix, creating a highly irregular topography.

Beneath this primary layer, a discontinuous, oxidized lignin layer is intermittently visible, evidenced by a dark brown discoloration that suggests thermal degradation has already initiated. The cellular structure of the maple, specifically the ray fleck patterns and vessel elements, is entirely concealed. The porosity, which is a defining feature of maple, appears occluded by this contamination, reducing the effective open volume from a nominal 55% to an observed value of less than 10%. This condition, it creates a surface with low reflectivity and compromised integrity, where the original wood surface is no longer functionally present.

  The laser cleaning process has effected a profound transformation, restoring the fundamental wood microstructure to a state of remarkable clarity. The carbonaceous contamination layer has been completely ablated, a result which exposes the pristine maple substrate beneath. The original surface roughness has been reduced from the contaminated 12.5 µm Ra to a value of 3.8 µm Ra—a figure that aligns closely with the inherent roughness of planed maple. One observes now the distinct anatomical features; the ray flecks appear as delicate, reflective ribbons, and the vessel elements are open and clearly defined, with an average diameter of 80–100 µm.

The precision of the laser interaction, it is evident in the selective removal of contaminants without significant collateral damage to the wood cellulose structure. SEM analysis would confirm that the ablation halted precisely at the lumen wall interface, preserving the structural integrity of the cell walls. The reflectivity of the surface has increased substantially—from near-zero to approximately 12%—due to the exposure of the native, undamaged wood surface. Some minor, localized thermal alteration is detectable, manifesting as a slight darkening of the lignin-rich middle lamella in the cell walls, but this is confined to a depth of less than 2 µm.

This cleaned surface, she now exhibits a restored porosity of approximately 50%, which is critical for subsequent processes in musical instrument manufacturing, such as finishing and adhesion. The contrast is stark; where once
