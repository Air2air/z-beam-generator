  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the maple wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The maple exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The maple substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
