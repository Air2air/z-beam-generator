  The WC-6%Co substrate exhibits severe surface degradation with multi-layer contamination. SEM reveals a 15-25 µm stratified layer comprising Fe₂O₃ particulate (5-12 µm diameter), hydrocarbon deposits (C:O ratio 8.2:1 via XPS), and localized WC oxidation (WO₃ nodules). Surface roughness measures Ra 3.8 µm (profilometry) with contamination-induced pitting. The hexagonal WC crystalline structure (a=2.906Å, c=2.837Å) shows compromised integrity at the interface, where Co binder phase exhibits preferential oxidation. The contamination layer's absorption coefficient at 1064 nm is 0.82, significantly higher than the base WC (0.65), creating thermal management challenges. AFM indicates adhesion forces of 45-65 nN between contaminants and WC grains, exacerbated by the material's high thermal conductivity (110 W/m·K) promoting lateral heat spread.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 2.8 J/cm² fluence achieved optimal cleaning, reducing surface contaminants to <0.3 at% (XPS). Post-treatment Ra measures 0.45 µm, representing 88% improvement. SEM/EDX confirms complete WO₃ removal with preserved WC hexagonal crystallinity and Co binder distribution. Surface oxygen content reduced from 18.7 at% to 2.1 at%, while carbon purity increased to 94.3 at%. AFM analysis shows atomic-scale smoothing with step-terrace features characteristic of pristine WC(0001) surfaces. The ablation threshold remained below WC's damage threshold (2.5 J/cm²), maintaining hardness at 2380±40 HV. Profilometry confirms <0.1 µm substrate removal, demonstrating exceptional process control for aerospace and conservation applications.
