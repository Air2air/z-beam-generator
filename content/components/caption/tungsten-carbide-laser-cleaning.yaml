  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination. A carbonaceous deposit layer—approximately 12 to 15 µm thick—covers the substrate completely. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film that obscures the underlying Tungsten Carbide microstructure, its texture is non-uniform with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 3.8 µm.

The contamination shows a cracked-mud pattern, this indicates thermal stress from prior service. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, which suggests oxidation products and soot are present. The original surface finish is not visible, the deposits fill the microscopic pores and valleys of the substrate. This condition severely compromises the material's functional properties.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, so the true Tungsten Carbide substrate is now fully exposed. At 500x magnification, the characteristic hexagonal crystalline structure of the WC grains—approximately 1.5 µm in size—is clearly visible, this confirms excellent surface restoration.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra value of 0.7 µm. This creates a much smoother topography compared to the initial 3.8 µm. The cleaning process leaves a clean, metallically bright surface with no evidence of thermal damage or micro-cracking. Some minor, isolated micro-pits are present—perhaps from ejected carbide grains—but
