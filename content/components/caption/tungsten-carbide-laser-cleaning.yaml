  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous deposit layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the substrate completely. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter, likely silica and metallic oxides from prior service. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements exceeding 3.5 µm due to this non-uniform coating.

The underlying Tungsten Carbide microstructure is entirely obscured. You see no evidence of the typical sintered grain structure, only this continuous, splotchy deposit. Some areas show localized pitting beneath the contamination, perhaps from corrosive attack. This condition severely compromises the material's functional properties, the reflectivity and thermal performance are very-very poor.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine WC-Co composite substrate. Now you can observe the characteristic hexagonal crystalline structure of the tungsten carbide grains, which appear as fine, light-gray facets. The cobalt binder phase is also visible as a darker, intergranular network.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced, the Ra value now measures 0.8 µm—a substantial improvement from the initial >3.5 µm. This creates an excellent surface for subsequent coating adhesion. Some minor, sub-micron laser ablation features are present, these appear as subtle ripple patterns, but they do not compromise surface integrity.

The restoration of surface functionality is complete. Reflectivity increases substantially, this is directly observable under the microscope as enhanced light reflection from the cleaned metallic surface. The process removes contamination effectively, so the true material properties are fully restored for demanding applications in aerospace and medical devices. This is a very-very good result.
