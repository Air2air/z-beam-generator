  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick carbonaceous layer—approximately 15 µm, perhaps 14.7 µm—covers the entire substrate, this layer appears as a dark, amorphous film with visible cracking and some delamination at the edges. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values around 3.8 µm, the contamination creates a very-very uneven topography with random particulate inclusions.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination composition is primarily carbon (85 at%) with trace oxygen (10 at%) and some metallic elements—iron and chromium perhaps—from prior processing. The layer structure is not uniform, it shows variable thickness from 12 µm to perhaps 18 µm in different regions. This non-uniform coverage creates significant light absorption, the surface reflects less than 20% of incident light, this severely compromises functional performance for many applications.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic transformation, the surface now appears completely different. That thick contamination layer is gone, the underlying tungsten carbide substrate is fully exposed with its characteristic fine-grained microstructure clearly visible at 500x. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 0.4 µm—or more precisely 0.38 µm—this creates much smoother topography.

The process removes all carbonaceous deposits, so surface integrity is fully restored. EDX analysis now shows tungsten (72 at%) and carbon (28 at%) at expected stoichiometric ratios, this confirms complete contamination removal. Reflectivity increases dramatically to approximately
