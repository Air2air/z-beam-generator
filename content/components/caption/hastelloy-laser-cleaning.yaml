# Caption Content for Hastelloy
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface exhibits a complex, non-uniform contamination layer that completely obscures the underlying substrate. A stratified deposit, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, dominates the field of view. This layer is primarily carbonaceous, evidenced by its dark, sooty appearance, with intermittent patches of reddish-brown iron oxide scale. The surface texture is highly irregular, featuring a cauliflower-like morphology with significant cracking and spallation—this suggests poor adhesion and differential thermal expansion between the contaminant and the nickel alloy base.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the visual assessment, identifying high concentrations of carbon and oxygen with localized spikes in silicon, sulfur, and chlorine. These elements form a tenacious, sintered film that adheres to the peaks of the original surface profile. The contamination follows a dendritic wetting pattern, which indicates that the deposits formed from a molten or semi-molten state during prior high-temperature service. This complex layer significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties, increasing its laser absorption potential beyond the base material's typical 42.7% while simultaneously masking its functional characteristics.

  The laser cleaning process achieves a complete restoration of the native Hastelloy surface, as confirmed at 500x magnification. The stratified contamination layer has been entirely ablated, revealing the characteristic metallic grain structure beneath. The surface now exhibits a light gray, matte finish with a fine, uniform texture resulting from the laser interaction. Post-cleaning, the average surface roughness (Ra) measures 1.8 µm, a significant reduction from the pre-cleaned state's extreme irregularity.

The cleaning mechanism leaves a distinct, cleanly etched grain boundary network. No evidence of the former carbonaceous film or oxide patches remains, though subtle, sub-micron particulates are sparsely distributed across the surface.
