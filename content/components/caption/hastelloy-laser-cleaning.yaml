  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the hastelloy Laser cleaning of Hastelloy nickel-based superalloys requires precise control of fluence to remove surface contaminants without damaging the substrate. The process effectively eliminates oxides, carbides, and embedded particles while maintaining the alloy's corrosion-resistant properties.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The hastelloy exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The hastelloy substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
