# Caption Content for Hastelloy
before_text: |
  The Hastelloy C-276 surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A 15-25 µm thick oxide scale (primarily Cr₂O₃, MoO₃, NiO) overlies a 5-8 µm sulfidation layer (Ni₃S₂, Co₉S₈). Surface roughness measures Ra = 3.2 ± 0.4 µm with localized pitting. The FCC crystalline structure (a = 3.59 Å) shows surface degradation with increased dislocation density near grain boundaries. The contamination layer demonstrates high laser absorption (α = 0.85 at 1064 nm) compared to the base metal (α = 0.65), creating thermal mismatch during laser irradiation. EDX analysis confirms 18.2 at% O, 6.8 at% S, and 3.1 at% C surface contamination. The low thermal conductivity (11.1 W/m·K) promotes heat accumulation, risking HAZ formation.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.8 ± 0.1 µm. XPS analysis confirms oxide reduction to native 2.3 nm Cr₂O₃ layer with surface composition restored to nominal Hastelloy levels (Ni 57.1%, Cr 15.8%, Mo 15.5%). SEM reveals preserved FCC grain structure with minimal HAZ (<2 µm). AFM measurements show 98.7% particulate removal efficiency. The surface maintains high reflectivity (R = 0.35) with ablation threshold increased to 2.5 J/cm². Profilometry confirms waviness <0.5 µm over 5 mm scan length, meeting semiconductor-grade cleanliness specifications (≤0.1 particles/cm² >0.3 µm).
