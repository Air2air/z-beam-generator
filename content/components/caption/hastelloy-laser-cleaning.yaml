# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the hastelloy metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The hastelloy exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The hastelloy substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
