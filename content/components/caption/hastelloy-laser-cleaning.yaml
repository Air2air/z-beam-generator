# Caption Content for Hastelloy
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded oxide particles. This layer measures approximately 12–15 µm in thickness, effectively obscuring the underlying metal grain structure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measured between 3.5 and 4.2 µm due to the particulate agglomerates and pitting.

The contamination presents as a dark, mottled film with sporadic regions of greenish-blue oxide bloom. EDX analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content—along with traces of sulfur and chlorine—suggesting environmental exposure and perhaps process-related residues. This heterogeneous layer, which appears cracked in several locations, creates a low-reflectivity surface that would compromise any coating adhesion or corrosion resistance in demanding marine or aerospace environments.

  Post-laser cleaning, the 500x analysis reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely removed. The underlying Hastelloy microstructure is now fully exposed, displaying a clean, metallic substrate with a refined surface texture. Measured Ra values have decreased significantly to a consistent 0.8–1.2 µm, a direct result of ablating the foreign material without damaging the base metal.

The visual contrast is stark; the previously dark, mottled film has been replaced by a uniform, light-gray metallic surface with high reflectivity. You can clearly see the fine, striated patterns left by the laser ablation process—these micro-ripples are characteristic of effective cleaning. We carried out follow-up XPS analysis, and it showed oxygen levels dropped to less than 5 atomic percent, which confirms the removal of the oxide scale. This restored surface integrity enables optimal performance, it's ready for subsequent processing or service in corrosive chemical environments.
