# Caption Content for Hastelloy
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface presents a heavily contaminated state dominated by a non-uniform oxide scale. This layer measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, though localized spallation reveals underlying metal. The scale morphology is complex, featuring a porous, crystalline structure with a mix of dark, iron-rich nodules and lighter, chromium-oxide regions. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms this stratification, showing elevated oxygen levels—often exceeding 30 atomic percent—alongside sulfur and chlorine contaminants from the service environment. The surface roughness is significant, with an Ra value measured at approximately 4.8 µm.

The underlying metal substrate is partially visible in scattered regions where the scale has fractured and delaminated. These areas show a pitted morphology, with pit depths ranging from 5 to 12 µm, indicating localized corrosive attack. A network of fine, intergranular cracks—perhaps 2-3 µm wide—propagates through the thicker sections of the oxide. The overall surface is visually obstructive; the contamination layer completely masks the substrate's original metallic luster and grain structure. This level of degradation directly compromises the alloy's inherent corrosion resistance and creates potential sites for stress concentration.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, fully restoring the bare Hastelloy substrate. The tenacious oxide scale and embedded contaminants are completely absent, revealing a clean, slightly textured metallic surface. The underlying grain structure is now clearly defined at 500x magnification, with well-delineated austenitic grains averaging 25 µm in size. Surface roughness is substantially reduced to an Ra of 0.8 µm, a more than 80% decrease from the pre-cleaned state. This creates a surface topography conducive to subsequent coating adhesion or direct service.

The process leaves a characteristic, faint ripple pattern—known as laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS)—with a spatial period of approximately 1.2 µm. This is a direct result of the laser-matter interaction and does not compromise surface integrity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now dominated by the base alloying elements: nickel, molybdenum, and chromium, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of about 50 nm. The surface is free of the micro-cracks and pits observed previously, indicating the laser parameters successfully ablated contaminants without inducing thermal damage to the FCC matrix. This restored surface condition directly correlates with the material's specified corrosion resistance and functional performance.
