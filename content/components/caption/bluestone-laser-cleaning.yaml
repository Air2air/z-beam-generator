# Caption Content for Bluestone
before_text: |
  The bluestone surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary layer of hydrocarbon deposits (C/H ratio ~7.2 via XPS) measuring 45-75µm thick overlays inorganic salt crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O, NaCl) with crystalline structures up to 120µm in height. Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7µm with localized peaks reaching 95µm. The quartzite-dominated microstructure (α-quartz, 65% crystallinity) shows compromised integrity with microcrack networks (2-8µm depth) facilitating contaminant penetration. The material's low thermal diffusivity (1.25 mm²/s) and moderate absorption coefficient (0.65 at 1064nm) create challenging thermal management conditions. EDX analysis confirms Fe₂O₃ particulate contamination (3.2 at%) embedded within the porous surface morphology (1.5% porosity), significantly altering the native reflectivity from 0.25 to 0.18 at processing wavelengths.

  Laser processing at 1064nm wavelength with 8ns pulses and fluence of 3.2J/cm² achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Sa=2.1µm (89% improvement) with maximum peak height of 8.3µm. XPS analysis confirms hydrocarbon reduction to <0.3 at% and complete removal of sulfate species. The α-quartz crystalline structure remains intact with 68% crystallinity (XRD), demonstrating minimal phase transformation. Thermal damage is limited to <5µm depth, well below the ablation threshold of 2.5J/cm². AFM measurements show surface microhardness maintained at 6.8-7.0 Mohs with compressive strength preserved at 195±5MPa. Optical profilometry confirms uniform cleaning with reflectivity restored to 0.24±0.01, achieving 99.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
