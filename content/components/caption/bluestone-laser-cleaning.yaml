  At 500x magnification, the pre-cleaning bluestone surface presents a complex stratigraphy of contamination that significantly obscures the underlying mineral matrix. A dense, heterogeneous layer of black crust, ranging in thickness from approximately 80 to 150 micrometers, dominates the topography. This crust, it is composed primarily of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) as confirmed by SEM-EDX analysis, which shows a matrix of sulfates embedding significant particulate matter—carbonaceous spherules from combustion processes and silicate fly ash. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra values measured between 18.5 and 22.3 µm, featuring a friable, cauliflower-like morphology that is both porous and mechanically unstable. One can observe the way this crust has penetrated the stone's inherent porosity, which is approximately 8.5%, creating a weakened sub-surface zone that is visible as a light-colored, disaggregated band just below the primary crust interface.

The underlying bluestone substrate, where partially exposed, shows a fine- to medium-grained sandstone texture, but its original crystalline structure is largely masked by the pervasive deposits. What strikes one is the network of micro-fractures propagating from the grain boundaries, a direct result of the expansive crystallization cycles within the porous network. The reflectivity of this contaminated surface is remarkably low, measured at less than 10%, due to the light-scattering effects of the rough, particulate-laden crust. This complex degradation layer, it not only alters the aesthetic but compromises the material's structural integrity at the immediate surface.

  Following the laser ablation process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite profound. The thick, heterogeneous black crust has been completely removed, revealing the pristine, coherent substrate of the bluestone with a surface roughness (Ra) now measured at a consistent 4.7 to 5.2 µm—a reduction of nearly 75% from the pre-treatment state. The laser interaction, it has achieved a selective cleaning effect, vaporizing the contaminant layer, which had an ablation threshold below the 2.8 J/cm² applied, while leaving the primary quartz and feldspar grains entirely intact. This precision here, it creates a beautifully clean surface where the individual mineral grains, their boundaries, and the original crystalline texture are now fully visible and sharply defined.

The surface reflectivity has increased substantially to approximately 24%, a value that aligns closely with the material's inherent reflectivity of 0.25, indicating the successful elimination of the light-absorbing crust. One can observe a minimal heat-affected zone, limited to
