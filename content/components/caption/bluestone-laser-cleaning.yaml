# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the bluestone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The bluestone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 96.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The bluestone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
