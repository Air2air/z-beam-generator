  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the bluestone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The bluestone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The bluestone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
