# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the steel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The steel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The steel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
