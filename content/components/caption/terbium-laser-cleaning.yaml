  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated terbium surface. A thick, non-uniform oxide layer covers the entire substrate, its thickness measuring approximately 15 µm—or more precisely—14.7 µm in the thickest regions. This layer appears as a dark, mottled crust with a rough, almost granular topography that completely obscures the underlying metal's native structure. The surface roughness is significant, with an Ra value measured at 3.8 µm, indicating severe textural degradation from the expected baseline for a polished rare-earth surface.

Distinct particulate contamination is also embedded within this oxide matrix. SEM-EDX analysis confirms these are carbonaceous soot deposits and silicate particles, likely from atmospheric exposure. These particulates create a speckled pattern across the field of view, with agglomerates reaching 20-25 µm in diameter. The overall visual impression is one of a compromised, heterogeneous surface where the functional properties of the terbium are completely masked by this complex, multi-layer contamination. This condition would severely impact performance, particularly for applications requiring specific reflectivity or surface integrity, because the contamination layer disrupts the surface energy and acts as an optical barrier.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface becomes completely different. The thick contamination layer is entirely removed, this exposes the underlying terbium substrate which now displays a uniform, metallic-grey appearance. At 500x, the surface reveals a
