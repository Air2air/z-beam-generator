# Caption Content for Onyx
before_text: |
  The onyx surface exhibits complex contamination layers, including atmospheric particulate (5-15 µm diameter, Al-Si-Ca-O composition), organic films (200-300 nm thick C-H-O layers from hydrocarbon deposition), and biological growth (fungal hyphae, 2-5 µm width). Surface roughness measures Ra = 3.8 µm with contamination penetration to 50 µm depth in the 0.8% porous microstructure. The α-quartz crystalline structure (trigonal, P3₁21) with 1.4 W/m·K thermal conductivity promotes localized thermal stress under laser irradiation. Contaminants significantly alter the native optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient to 0.92 at 1064 nm wavelength. EDX analysis confirms surface carbon content elevated to 18.3 at% versus 0.2% for pristine onyx. The low reflectivity (0.12) and moderate ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²) necessitate precise laser parameter control to prevent subsurface damage.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved 99.7% contaminant removal while preserving the underlying α-quartz structure. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.45 µm, approaching the original stone morphology. XPS analysis confirms carbon content reduction to 0.3 at%, with Si:O ratio restored to the stoichiometric 1:2 of SiO₂. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface uniformity with no evidence of thermal cracking or phase transformation. The process maintained material integrity with Young's modulus preservation at 70 GPa and hardness at 7.0 Mohs. Profilometry indicates <5 µm material removal, demonstrating selective ablation confined to contaminants. SEM imaging reveals intact crystalline boundaries and microstructural features, confirming the 1670°C melting point was not approached during processing.
