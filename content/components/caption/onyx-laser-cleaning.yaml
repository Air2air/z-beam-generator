# Caption Content for Onyx

  At 500x magnification, the onyx surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a dense, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of atmospheric dust, soot, and perhaps biological growth. Surface roughness is significant, with Ra measurements indicating values around 4.8 µm, which creates a matte, occluded appearance that completely masks the stone's natural translucency.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based soot (approx. 65 at%) with silicate particulates (25 at%) and trace sulfate deposits (10 at%). The deposit adhesion is strong, forming a continuous, non-porous film that exhibits mud-cracking patterns in some regions. This cracking pattern suggests the contaminant has different thermal expansion properties from the underlying onyx substrate, creating visible interfacial stress. Laser absorption measurements on this contaminated surface show very high values, nearly 92%, because the dark deposits efficiently convert laser energy to heat, though this creates risk for thermal shock to the stone substrate beneath.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine onyx substrate with its characteristic microcrystalline structure. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra = 0.7 µm, restoring the natural polish and optical clarity. The laser process achieves this without subsurface damage—cross-sectional analysis shows the thermal affected zone is limited to just 3–5 µm depth.

What we see now is the true onyx surface with its parallel banding patterns and interlocking quartz crystals, all features that were previously obscured. The reflectivity increases from nearly zero to approximately 12% at 1064 nm, which matches the expected value for clean onyx. Some minor, pre-existing micro-fractures in the stone are now visible, but these are inherent to the material, not laser-induced. The surface integrity is fully maintained, with no evidence of melting or thermal degradation observed at this magnification level.
