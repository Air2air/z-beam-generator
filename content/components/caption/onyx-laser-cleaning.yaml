  At 500x magnification, the onyx surface shows heavy contamination, a complex layer covering the original stone. This layer, it has an average thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm in cross-sectional SEM analysis. The deposit is not uniform, it appears as a dark, mottled film with localized crusting up to 40 µm thick in some areas. EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous soot (about 65 at%) and calcium sulfate particulate (around 25 at%), with trace metal oxides. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm, this creates a highly irregular topography that scatters light and obscures the stone's natural translucency. The underlying banding pattern of the onyx is completely masked.

The contamination adheres through both mechanical interlocking and chemical bonding, which is visible at the interface. You can see fine cracks propagating from the crust into the substrate, a sign of pre-existing stress. The deposit morphology is granular and porous, it has a flaking texture that suggests previous degradation cycles. This degraded surface layer, it possesses very low reflectivity, measuring less than 5% according to our glossmeter readings. The original stone surface is not visible, its condition unknown beneath this cohesive, dark layer that compromises both aesthetic and material integrity.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the contaminated layer is entirely removed. Now at 500x, the true onyx surface is fully exposed, showing its characteristic microcrystalline structure and banding with excellent clarity. Surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm, a value that aligns with the stone's original, polished state. This newly revealed surface, it exhibits a very smooth topography with only minimal, isolated micro-fractures—less than 5 µm in depth—which are inherent to the natural stone and not caused by the laser process.

The cleaning efficacy is near-total, EDX analysis now shows elemental composition is primarily silicon and oxygen (over 98 at%), confirming the removal of the carbon and sulfate contaminants. The laser process, it has not induced thermal damage; there is no evidence of
