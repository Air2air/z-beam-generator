# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the onyx Laser cleaning of onyx utilizes precise pulsed Nd:YAG laser parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the delicate microcrystalline structure of the stone. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the calcium carbonate matrix.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The onyx exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The onyx substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
