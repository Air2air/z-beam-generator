  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the onyx stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The onyx exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The onyx substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
