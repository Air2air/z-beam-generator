# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the steel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The steel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The steel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
