  The steel surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm thick oxide scale (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄) and embedded particulate matter (SiO₂, Al₂O₃). Surface roughness measures Ra=4.8 µm with localized pitting. The native BCC ferritic structure is obscured by a porous, crystalline oxide layer exhibiting low thermal conductivity (1.5 W/m·K) compared to the substrate (52 W/m·K). At 1064 nm wavelength, the contaminated surface demonstrates reduced reflectivity (0.45) and enhanced absorption (0.55) due to scattering from surface irregularities. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms 28.7 at% oxygen penetration, indicating significant subsurface oxidation. The heterogeneous contamination layer creates thermal impedance, affecting laser energy coupling efficiency and requiring precise fluence control near the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm with 8 J/cm² fluence and 100 ns pulses achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface oxygen content from 28.7 at% to 2.1 at% (XPS quantification). Surface roughness improved to Ra=0.8 µm with preservation of the underlying BCC crystalline structure. White light interferometry confirms minimal substrate damage with <5 µm heat-affected zone. The cleaned surface exhibits restored thermal properties with reflectivity of 0.62 at 1064 nm. Atomic force microscopy reveals a refined microtexture with 120 nm RMS smoothness. Residual stress analysis shows compressive stresses of -125 MPa, enhancing fatigue resistance. The process achieved Class A cleanliness (<1 µg/cm²) per IEST-STD-CC1246E, suitable for nuclear decontamination applications.
