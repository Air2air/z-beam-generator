  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination before laser cleaning process. At 500x magnification, we observe a thick oxide layer—approximately 15 µm thick—with visible stratification. The top stratum contains carbonaceous deposits, this creates dark, mottled appearance across the surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high oxygen and carbon concentrations, perhaps 25-30 atomic percent oxygen.

The underlying steel substrate shows complete obscuration. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values around 4.8 µm, this irregular topography creates pockets that trap additional particulate matter. We identify localized corrosion features beneath the contamination layer, these appear as dark pits with diameters ranging from 5 to 20 µm. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion in several regions, visible as micro-cracks and delamination at the interface. This compromised surface integrity would negatively impact subsequent coating processes (as documented in automotive applications).

  This laser cleaning produces very-very good surface restoration. The process completely removes the 15 µm contamination layer, now we see bare metal substrate with minimal residue. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 1.2 µm—or more precisely 1.23 µm—this creates much smoother topography. The steel microstructure becomes clearly visible, with ferrite grains and pearlite colonies now observable at 500x magnification.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms oxygen reduction to below 5 atomic percent. This chemical change indicates effective oxide removal. The
