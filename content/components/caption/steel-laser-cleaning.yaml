  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very clear under 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer covers the substrate completely, this layer measures approximately 15–20 µm thick. The oxide appears as a dark, crusty deposit with a cracked-mud pattern, and beneath it, you see carbonaceous soot particles embedded into the surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high oxygen and carbon content—perhaps 25 at.% oxygen—which indicates significant oxidation and hydrocarbon buildup.

The original mill-finished steel texture is completely obscured. Surface roughness measurements show increased variation, Ra values jump to around 2.5–3.0 µm because the contamination creates an uneven, porous topography. You observe localized pitting—or more precisely—micro-scale corrosion sites where the base metal has started to degrade. This contaminated state reduces surface reflectivity dramatically, the laser absorption is very low because the contamination layer scatters incoming light instead of letting it interact with the metal substrate properly.

  Laser cleaning produces a very-very good transformation. The process removes the contamination layer completely, so the underlying steel substrate becomes fully exposed. At 500x magnification, you now see a clean, metallic surface with a light micro-texture from the laser interaction. The surface roughness is reduced significantly to an Ra of 1.2 µm—or more precisely—1.15 to 1.25 µm, which is much
