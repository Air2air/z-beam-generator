  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the steel Steel laser cleaning utilizes high-intensity pulsed laser radiation at 1064nm wavelength to selectively remove surface contaminants through rapid thermal expansion and ablation processes. The process effectively removes rust, paint, oxides, oils, and other surface contaminants while preserving the underlying steel substrate due to differential absorption characteristics.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The steel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The steel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
