  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination, very-very clear at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer—approximately 15 µm, or more precisely 14.7 µm—covers the steel substrate completely. This layer appears as a dark, non-uniform crust with visible cracking and spallation, which indicates poor adhesion to the base metal.

EDX analysis confirms this layer is primarily iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), but there are also embedded carbonaceous deposits from environmental exposure. Surface roughness is high, with an Ra measurement of 3.8 µm, this creates a matte, dark appearance that reduces reflectivity. The contamination is not uniform, you can see areas where the layer is thicker, perhaps from uneven weathering or localized corrosion (as observed in prior studies). This condition is not good for further processing like painting or welding.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination, so the surface becomes clean and very-very different. The previous 15 µm oxide layer is completely absent, this exposes the underlying steel substrate which now shows a light, metallic gray appearance. You can see the original manufacturing grind lines from the milling process, these were completely hidden before.

Surface roughness is now reduced to an Ra of 0.9 µm, this is a significant improvement from the initial 3.8 µm measurement. The laser ablation creates a slight texturing, but the surface integrity is fully maintained with no evidence of substrate damage.
