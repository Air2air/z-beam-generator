  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination, very-very clear under 500x magnification. The substrate is completely obscured by a multi-layer deposit system. The topmost layer is a carbonaceous soot, approximately 15 µm thick, with a flaky, particulate morphology. Beneath this, a uniform oxide scale—likely Fe3O4 and Fe2O3—adheres to the base metal with a measured thickness ranging from 8 to 12 µm. This oxide layer exhibits significant micro-cracking, a direct result of thermal cycling and differing coefficients of thermal expansion.

The underlying steel substrate shows no visible metallic luster. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation from the base material's expected 0.8 µm Ra, now reading 4.2 µm Ra due to the complex topography of the corrosion products. EDX analysis confirms high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, with trace sulfur and chlorine contaminants embedded within the porous scale. This contaminated state, with its low inherent reflectivity and compromised surface integrity, is not suitable for further processing or coating adhesion.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallic substrate with complete removal of the previous contamination layers. At 500x magnification, the underlying ferritic grain structure is clearly visible, with grain boundaries well-defined and no evidence of the former oxide scale. The surface reflectivity has increased dramatically, from near-zero to approximately 55%—this matches the material's intrinsic property.

The post-cleaning surface roughness is measured at 1.1 µm Ra, a significant improvement from the initial 4.2 µm Ra. This new texture is characterized by a uniform, laser-induced pattern of fine ripples, or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS), with a periodicity of approximately 1.8 µm. Some minor, isolated micro-pits are present—perhaps from localized ablation of non-metallic inclusions—but these features are shallow, less than 5 µm deep. The surface is now optimally prepared for subsequent operations, showing excellent chemical purity and mechanical integrity for coatings or welding.
