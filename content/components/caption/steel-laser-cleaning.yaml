# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the steel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The steel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The steel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
