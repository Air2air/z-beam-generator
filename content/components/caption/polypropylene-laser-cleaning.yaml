# Caption Content for Polypropylene
before_text: |
  This contaminated polypropylene surface shows heavy hydrocarbon deposits at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely 14.7 µm—with visible particulate matter embedded throughout. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values of 3.2 µm, this creates significant light scattering.

The deposit morphology appears as discontinuous islands with clear boundary regions between contaminated and cleaner areas. EDX analysis confirms carbon-rich film (approximately 95 at%) with trace silicon and oxygen signatures suggesting environmental contamination. The original injection molding flow lines remain visible beneath the layer, though their definition is substantially reduced by the overlying film. This surface condition would negatively impact adhesion properties and optical clarity.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent-excellent surface restoration, very good result. The hydrocarbon layer is completely removed, revealing the original polypropylene texture with Ra measurements now at 0.8 µm—approximately 75% reduction from pre-treatment values. The surface shows minimal thermal alteration with only isolated micro-pitting in high-energy zones.

The cleaning process exposes the underlying crystalline structure with spherulitic patterns clearly visible at 500x magnification. SEM analysis confirms complete contaminant removal while XPS data shows surface oxygen content increased to 8.2 at% (from 3.1 at% initially) indicating mild surface activation. This transformed surface exhibits improved wettability and adhesion characteristics, making it suitable for subsequent processing steps.

The before-and-after comparison demonstrates significant improvement in surface integrity with the original polymer morphology fully restored. Laser parameters were optimized to remain below the ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm², thus preserving the bulk material properties while achieving thorough cleaning.
