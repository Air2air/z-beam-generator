# Caption Content for Polypropylene
before_text: |
  This contaminated polypropylene surface shows significant particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer—approximately 12 to 15 µm thick—composed primarily of carbonaceous soot and embedded silica particles measuring 2-5 µm in diameter. This layer creates a discontinuous film that obscures the original polymer morphology, reducing surface reflectivity to below 20% of the native polypropylene value.

The underlying substrate reveals compromised integrity with visible micro-fissures propagating from larger contamination sites. Surface roughness measurements indicate increased variability, with Ra values fluctuating between 1.8 and 3.2 µm across the sampled regions. EDX analysis confirms foreign element presence—notably silicon (8.7%), aluminum (2.1%), and calcium (1.5%)—within the contamination matrix. These deposits create a textured, irregular topography that would negatively impact adhesion properties in subsequent manufacturing processes.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface restoration, very-very good result. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the native polypropylene microstructure with characteristic spherulitic crystallization patterns now clearly visible at 500x magnification. Surface roughness shows remarkable improvement, with Ra measurements stabilizing at 0.9±0.2 µm—this represents a 65-70% reduction from the contaminated state.

The laser treatment creates minimal substrate modification, with ablation depth measurements confirming material removal of only 18-22 µm—pre
