  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick, discontinuous film—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the polypropylene substrate completely. This layer appears as dark, amorphous deposits that obscure the original polymer texture, creating a mottled pattern of black and grey areas.

The contamination layer has a very rough, almost crust-like morphology with visible embedded particulate matter. Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual assessment, showing an Ra value of approximately 4.5 µm, which is exceptionally high. This high roughness and the pervasive coverage significantly degrade the surface's intrinsic properties, its reflectivity is nearly zero and its potential for adhesion is very poor.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface becomes completely different. At 500x magnification, the previous contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the underlying polypropylene morphology with high clarity. The original polymer texture—with its characteristic spherulitic structure—is now fully exposed and undamaged.

Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual improvement, the Ra value drops significantly to about 0.8 µm. This smoothness is very-very good for adhesion purposes. The cleaning is highly selective, it removes only the contaminant layer and leaves the base material completely intact, as verified by post-process EDX analysis which shows carbon atomic percentage returning to >99%.

This creates a functionally restored surface. Reflectivity increases substantially, from nearly zero to a measured 65 gloss
