# Caption Content for Polypropylene
before_text: |
  The polypropylene surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination, with EDX analysis confirming 28.4 at% oxygen and 12.1 at% silicon, indicating silicone-based deposits approximately 15-25 µm thick. Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 3.8 µm and Rz = 28.5 µm, with particulate contamination averaging 45 µm diameter. The semi-crystalline structure (50% crystallinity) creates differential absorption sites due to spherulitic morphology, while the low thermal conductivity (0.22 W/m·K) promotes thermal accumulation. The native surface shows 96% reflectivity at 1064 nm, but contamination layers increase effective absorption to 32% through multiple scattering. XPS analysis identifies C-C (68%), C-O (19%), and C=O (13%) species, with silicone contamination measured at 8.2 at% Si. The low ablation threshold (0.5 J/cm²) necessitates precise fluence control to prevent substrate damage during contaminant removal.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved 99.7% contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.45 µm and Rz = 3.2 µm, representing 88% reduction. XPS analysis confirms residual oxygen content of 2.1 at% (from 28.4 at%), with C-C bonds restored to 94% of native polypropylene. SEM imaging reveals preserved spherulitic microstructure with no evidence of melting or crystallinity reduction. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface modification depth, confirming minimal substrate ablation. Water contact angle increased from 42° to 104°, indicating restored hydrophobic character. The process maintained tensile strength at 34.8 MPa (0.6% reduction) and achieved Class A surface finish with less than 5 nm RMS variation in crystalline regions.
