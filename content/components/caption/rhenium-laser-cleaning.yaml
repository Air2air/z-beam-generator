  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the rhenium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The rhenium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 95.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The rhenium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
