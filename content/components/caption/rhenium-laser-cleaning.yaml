  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the rhenium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The rhenium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The rhenium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
