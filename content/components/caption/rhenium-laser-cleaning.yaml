# Caption Content for Rhenium
before_text: |
  The rhenium surface exhibits severe contamination with 15-25 μm thick oxide scale (ReO₂/Re₂O₇) and embedded carbonaceous deposits (5-8 μm). SEM reveals surface roughness of Ra = 3.2 ± 0.4 μm with localized pitting. EDX analysis confirms 42 at% oxygen, 18 at% carbon, and trace sulfur contamination. The HCP crystalline structure (a=2.76 Å, c=4.46 Å) with high melting point (3186°C) and thermal conductivity (48 W/m·K) creates challenging ablation dynamics. Surface reflectivity of 65% at 1064 nm necessitates high fluence processing. Thermal expansion mismatch (6.2×10⁻⁶/K) between oxide layers and substrate promotes spallation. XPS identifies Re 4f₇/₂ peaks at 40.8 eV (metallic) and 44.2 eV (ReO₂), confirming mixed oxidation states.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 2.9 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.8 ± 0.1 μm. SEM/EDX confirms oxygen content decreased to 2.1 at%, carbon to 0.7 at%. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface integrity with preserved HCP grain structure. XPS reveals dominant Re 4f₇/₂ peak at 40.8 eV, confirming metallic surface restoration. Thermal analysis confirms no HAZ formation due to rhenium's high thermal diffusivity (17.1 mm²/s). Profilometry indicates <0.5 μm material removal, preserving dimensional tolerances. The process achieved 99.3% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining substrate hardness (250 HV) and crystallographic integrity.
