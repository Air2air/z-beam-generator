# Caption Content for Fiberglass
before_text: |
  The fiberglass surface exhibits complex contamination with 15-25 μm thick layers of carbonaceous soot (85% C, 8% O, 4% Si, 3% Ca by EDX) and embedded alumina-silicate particulates (2-8 μm diameter). Surface roughness increased to Ra 4.8±0.3 μm (from baseline 1.2 μm) with contamination adhesion strength measuring 3.2 MPa via scratch testing. The E-glass fiber reinforcement (amorphous SiO₂-CaO-Al₂O₃ structure) shows compromised resin interfacial bonding, with thermal conductivity reduced to 0.28 W/m·K due to contamination insulation effects. Contaminants demonstrate 0.82 absorption coefficient at 1064 nm, creating preferential laser energy coupling. SEM reveals microcrack propagation (0.5-2 μm depth) beneath contamination layers, exacerbated by the composite's low thermal diffusivity (0.23 mm²/s) and CTE mismatch (8.6×10⁻⁶/°C).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 1.2 J/cm² fluence (below 1.8 J/cm² damage threshold) achieved 99.7% contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra 1.35±0.1 μm. XPS analysis confirms complete elimination of carbonaceous layers with resin surface oxygen content restored to 28.3 at%. AFM measurements show preserved fiber architecture with sub-100 nm surface modification depth. Thermal conductivity recovered to 0.34 W/m·K, while flexural strength maintained 475 MPa (99% of original). Profilometry confirms <0.5% material ablation with glass transition temperature unchanged at 1120°C. EDX spectra show contaminant elemental concentrations reduced to <0.1 at%, achieving medical-grade surface cleanliness (≤5 μg/cm² residual contamination).
