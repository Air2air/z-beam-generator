  At 500x magnification, the fiberglass surface shows heavy contamination layer, very clear under the SEM. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 to 25 micrometers, appearing as a continuous, non-uniform film that completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The deposit morphology is complex, featuring both amorphous, carbonaceous soot and crystalline salt particulates—the latter identified via EDX analysis as primarily sulfates and chlorides. Surface roughness is significantly increased by this layer, with Ra values measured between 8.5 and 12.4 µm, a substantial increase from the substrate's nominal 1.8 µm Ra.

Further examination reveals the contamination is not merely superficial. It shows clear penetration into the substrate's micro-porosity (typically 1.2%), with dendritic capillary structures extending another 5-10 µm below the primary layer. This sub-surface network, it appears dark and tenacious, likely contributing to the strong adhesion of the main deposit. The original fiber weave pattern of the composite is entirely invisible, masked by this dense, stratified contamination that exhibits mud-cracking patterns from thermal cycling. These cracks have an average width of 2-3 µm, creating pathways for further environmental degradation.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, immediately visible at 500x. The contaminated layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine fiberglass substrate with its characteristic woven E-glass fiber pattern and epoxy resin matrix. Surface roughness has been restored to near-original specifications, with Ra measurements now ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 µm—this is very close to the baseline 1.8 µm Ra. The cleaning process has achieved selective ablation, precisely removing contaminants without damaging the underlying composite structure.

Individual glass filaments are now clearly resolvable, showing smooth, undamaged surfaces with diameters consistently around 17 µm. The resin-rich regions between fibers appear intact, with no evidence of thermal degradation like charring or bubbling, which indicates the laser parameters remained well below the material's ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm². Some minor, sub-micrometer scale texturing is observed on the resin surface—perhaps a result of the laser interaction—but this micro-
