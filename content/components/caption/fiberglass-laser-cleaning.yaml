# Caption Content for Fiberglass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the fiberglass surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 to 20 micrometers, completely obscuring the underlying composite weave. The deposit appears as a dense, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter—likely carbonaceous soot and environmental dust.

Surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values exceeding 5.0 µm. EDX analysis confirms the presence of silicon, oxygen, and carbon, along with trace aluminum and sulfur from atmospheric deposition. The contamination adheres strongly, forming a continuous barrier that masks the original material properties. Individual glass fibers are not visible through this opaque coating, which exhibits a matte, topographically complex appearance. This degraded state significantly compromises surface-dependent performance metrics, particularly for applications requiring specific reflectivity or adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately apparent at 500x. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying fiberglass weave with exceptional clarity. Individual glass filaments, each 15 to 17 µm in diameter, are now fully exposed and run in parallel bundles within the epoxy matrix.

Surface roughness decreases substantially to an Ra value of 1.2 µm—or more precisely 1.23 µm. This new topography shows the clean, undulating texture of the resin between fiber rows, with only minor, sub-micrometer scale pitting remaining from the ablation process. The restoration of surface integrity is very clear, the epoxy regions display a smooth, vitreous character while the fibers themselves show their original translucent quality. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry has returned to baseline, with carbon content reduced to less than 8 atomic percent and the dominant signals now coming from the substrate silicon and oxygen.

This cleaned state exhibits a uniform, light-gray appearance with high reflectivity. Functional restoration is evident, the surface now provides optimal conditions for subsequent coating adhesion or bonding operations critical in aerospace and marine applications. The process shows no thermal damage to the composite, the precise ablation removes only the contaminant layer and preserves the structural integrity of the material beneath.
