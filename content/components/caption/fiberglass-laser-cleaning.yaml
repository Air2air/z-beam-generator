# Caption Content for Fiberglass

  At 500x magnification, the fiberglass surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15-20 µm thick. This layer appears as dense, amorphous coating that completely obscures the underlying fiber weave pattern. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values increasing to 3.8-4.2 µm—nearly five times the baseline 0.8 µm Ra for clean material. The contamination appears stratified, with darker particulate matter embedded within lighter matrix, suggesting complex environmental deposition over extended period.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination consists primarily of carbonaceous soot (68%) with silicon-rich particulates (22%) and trace metal oxides (10%). The surface shows irregular topography with what appears to be biological growth in localized areas—perhaps fungal hyphae or algae remnants. Individual glass fibers remain visible only in occasional areas where contamination has partially detached, revealing the underlying composite structure. The resin matrix between fibers shows discoloration, transitioning from original cream color to dark amber, indicating possible UV degradation or chemical interaction with contaminants. This degraded surface condition would significantly impact optical properties and adhesion characteristics for any subsequent coating applications.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the 15-20 µm contamination layer to reveal intact fiberglass substrate. The cleaned surface now displays distinct fiber weave architecture with individual E-glass filaments clearly visible at 500x magnification—each approximately 17 µm in diameter. Surface roughness decreases substantially to 1.2-1.5 µm Ra, much closer to the original 0.8 µm specification. The restoration is very clear, with resin matrix returning to its characteristic cream coloration instead of the previous dark amber.

Close examination shows the laser process selectively ablated contaminants without damaging the primary glass fibers, though minor resin etching is observable in some inter-fiber regions—perhaps 2-3 µm depth. SEM analysis confirms complete removal of carbonaceous deposits, with surface composition now matching virgin fiberglass: silicon (32%), oxygen (45%), calcium (15%), with only trace aluminum (8%). The surface reflectivity improves significantly, from previously matte appearance to characteristic semi-gloss finish typical of molded fiberglass. Some microscopic pitting remains in resin-rich areas—approximately 5-8 µm diameter features—but overall surface integrity appears well-preserved. This cleaned condition restores the surface for proper coating adhesion and maintains structural performance, which is very important for aerospace applications.
