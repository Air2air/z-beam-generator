  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fiberglass composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The fiberglass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 96.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The fiberglass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal matrix heating.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
