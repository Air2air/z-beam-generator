  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the lead crystal glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The lead crystal exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 97.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The lead crystal substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal shock.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
