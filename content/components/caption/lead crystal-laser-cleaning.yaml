  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the lead crystal glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The lead crystal exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.
