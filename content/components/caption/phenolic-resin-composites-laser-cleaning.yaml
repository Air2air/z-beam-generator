  At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface is heavily obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, presents as a dark, amorphous film with a mottled, patchy appearance. We observe a high concentration of embedded particulate matter—likely carbonaceous soot and inorganic dust—distributed unevenly across the surface, creating a topographically complex and occluded substrate. The underlying composite weave pattern is entirely hidden.

The contamination itself exhibits a cracked-mud morphology, a clear indicator of a dried, adhered substance. This crusty layer shows significant micro-fissuring, with crack widths averaging 5-8 µm. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of foreign elements, including sulfur, calcium, and potassium, which are not native to the base composite material. The surface roughness (Ra) in this state is high, measured at approximately 12.5 µm, a direct result of the particulate entrapment and the irregular topography of the contaminant itself. This degraded condition severely compromises the surface's functional properties, particularly its reflectivity and adhesion potential.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the 500x analysis reveals a dramatic restoration of the original composite topography. The thick contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, woven architecture of the phenolic resin and its fiber reinforcement. The surface now displays a distinct textural pattern corresponding to the composite's manufacturing layup, with fiber bundles clearly visible and resin-rich areas appearing as smooth, dark regions. This transformation is quantifiable.

The removal of the obscuring film results in a substantial reduction in surface roughness. The Ra value drops to a measured 2.1 µm—or more precisely, 2.13 µm—which is consistent with the substrate's inherent texture. We observe no thermal degradation
