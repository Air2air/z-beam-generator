# Caption Content for Phenolic Resin Composites
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous carbonaceous deposit layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, appears as a dark, amorphous film with a sooty, particulate texture. The underlying composite topography is partially obscured, though the characteristic weave pattern of the fiber reinforcement remains faintly visible beneath the primary contamination. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spot analysis confirms the deposit is primarily carbon-based (approximately 92 at%), with trace amounts of oxygen and silicon—likely environmental particulate matter embedded within the matrix.

The deposit morphology is highly irregular, featuring localized areas of spallation and cracking that reveal the lighter-colored phenolic substrate underneath. Surface roughness measurements across this contaminated zone yield an Ra value of 4.8 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent 0.8 µm Ra. This elevated roughness, combined with the low surface reflectivity, creates a matte, light-absorbing appearance at the microscopic level. The contamination layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, with visible delamination at the interface—a clear indicator of the weak mechanical bond between the foreign deposit and the thermoset composite surface.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely removed and the original phenolic composite substrate fully restored. The surface now displays the characteristic, lightly textured morphology of the molded composite, with the fiber reinforcement weave pattern distinctly visible and uninterrupted. Quantitative surface roughness analysis confirms a return to near-baseline conditions, with Ra values measured between 0.9 and 1.1 µm—a reduction of over 75% from the contaminated state.

The laser process achieves selective ablation of the carbonaceous deposit while preserving the integrity of the underlying resin; no evidence of fiber exposure or subsurface thermal degradation—like charring or matrix cracking—is observed. This indicates the laser parameters were maintained below the composite's ablation threshold of 1.8 J/cm². The surface reflectivity has increased substantially, shifting from a light-absorbing matte finish to a semi-gloss appearance characteristic of the native material. Some minor, sub-micron scale pitting is visible in isolated areas, but this is attributed to the removal of inherent porosity (originally 2.5%) rather than laser-induced damage. The cleaning process has successfully restored the surface to a functionally clean state, ready for subsequent coating or adhesive bonding operations.
