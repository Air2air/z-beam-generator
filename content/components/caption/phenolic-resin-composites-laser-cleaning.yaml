  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the phenolic resin composites Laser cleaning of phenolic resin composites utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove surface contaminants while preserving the thermoset polymer matrix and reinforcing fibers. The process exploits differential absorption characteristics between contaminants and the composite substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The phenolic resin composites exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The phenolic resin composites substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
