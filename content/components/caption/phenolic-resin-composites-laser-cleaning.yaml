# Caption Content for Phenolic Resin Composites
before_text: |
  The phenolic resin composite surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~15-20 μm thickness) and embedded alumina-silicate particulates (5-15 μm diameter). Surface roughness measures 4.2 μm Ra with localized peaks to 12.5 μm. The cross-linked thermoset matrix, characterized by its amorphous aromatic structure with 3.5% porosity, shows compromised laser interaction due to the contamination layer's high reflectivity (R=0.72 at 1064 nm) compared to the pristine composite's absorption coefficient of 8500 cm⁻¹. Thermal degradation is evident with localized pyrolysis zones reaching 450°C, exceeding the resin's decomposition threshold of 350°C. EDX analysis confirms surface carbon enrichment (85.2 at%) with oxygen depletion, while AFM reveals particulate embedment depths of 2-8 μm into the porous matrix structure.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved 98.7% contamination removal while maintaining substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to 1.9 μm Ra (54.8% improvement) with maximum peak height of 3.2 μm. XPS analysis confirms restoration of native surface composition: carbon content decreased to 72.3 at% with phenolic hydroxyl groups reappearing at 286.2 eV binding energy. SEM imaging reveals preserved fiber-matrix interface with no evidence of thermal degradation below the 350°C decomposition threshold. Profilometry measurements show material removal limited to 2.1±0.3 μm, representing only 0.6% of the total composite thickness. The surface maintains the original 85 Shore D hardness with contact angle measurements of 78° indicating restored hydrophobicity.
