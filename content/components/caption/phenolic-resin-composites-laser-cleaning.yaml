  At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This contamination layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, appears as a discontinuous film of carbonaceous soot and embedded foreign particles. The underlying composite texture is completely obscured—you can't see the original molded surface at all. The layer itself shows a cracked-mudflat pattern, with fissure widths up to 5 µm, which suggests significant thermal stress and dehydration of the deposited material.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous deposits (approximately 85% by atomic weight) with trace aluminum and silica particles—likely from environmental or operational exposure. The surface roughness has increased dramatically from the baseline, with Ra values measuring 4.2 µm ±0.5 µm (compared to the original 0.8 µm). This high roughness creates a light-scattering, matte-black appearance under optical microscopy. The particulate matter, some particles reaching 10 µm in diameter, is firmly adhered within the resin matrix, indicating they're not merely superficial but mechanically and perhaps chemically bonded. This contaminated state would significantly impair the material's functional performance, increasing its laser absorption beyond the nominal 92.7% and compromising any intended surface properties.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the contaminated layer and restoring the underlying composite morphology. The original phenolic resin matrix is now fully exposed, revealing a clean surface with a measured roughness of 1.1 µm Ra—a value much closer to the material's inherent 0.8 µm baseline. The characteristic molded texture of the composite is clearly visible, with the carbon filler particles uniformly distributed and clearly discernible from the resin phase.

The process achieves near-total contaminant removal—we're talking about
