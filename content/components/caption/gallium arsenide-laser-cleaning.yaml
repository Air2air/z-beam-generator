  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the gallium arsenide semiconductor substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The gallium arsenide exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of semiconductor materials.
  The contamination appears to be from fabrication processes and cleanroom contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 97.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The gallium arsenide substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved crystalline structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
