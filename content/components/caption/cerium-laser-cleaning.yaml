# Caption Content for Cerium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the cerium surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. This layer measures approximately 15 µm in thickness and exhibits a mottled, dark gray appearance that obscures the underlying metallic substrate. The contamination appears as both discrete, crystalline deposits—ranging from 5 to 20 µm in diameter—and a more pervasive, amorphous carbonaceous soot. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 2.5 µm due to the uneven deposit topology.

The topography reveals a complex structure of stratified layers, suggesting multiple contamination events. The uppermost layer consists of loosely adhered particulates, while a more tenacious, lower layer shows evidence of minor chemical interaction with the cerium substrate. SEM imaging confirms this stratification, and EDX analysis identifies the primary contaminants as carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon also present. This composite film drastically reduces surface reflectivity, creating a dull, matte finish.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the cerium surface undergoes a dramatic transformation observable at 500x. The previously dominant contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the intact, underlying metal substrate with a restored, specular finish. The process successfully ablated the 15 µm film without imparting measurable thermal damage to the cerium itself—a critical outcome. Post-cleaning Ra measurements show a substantial decrease in surface roughness, now averaging 0.8 µm, which directly correlates to the observed improvement in reflectivity.

The cleaning mechanism appears highly selective, targeting the contaminant's absorption characteristics at the specified laser wavelength. This approach achieves complete contaminant removal while preserving the base material's integrity. We carried out subsequent XPS analysis, which confirms the surface is now predominantly cerium oxide—the native, protective state—with no detectable carbon or sulfur residues.
