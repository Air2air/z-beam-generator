  At 500x magnification, the polystyrene surface presents a heavily compromised topography, dominated by a non-uniform contaminant layer. This layer, it is primarily a carbonaceous film with embedded particulate matter—approximately 12 to 15 µm in thickness—that completely obscures the native polymer substrate. One observes a complex morphology of agglomerated deposits, which appear as dark, splotchy regions interspersed with reflective crystalline particulates, likely salt or oxide-based, measuring up to 8 µm in diameter. The underlying polystyrene, where partially visible, shows a smeared, plastically deformed texture, suggesting prior mechanical abrasion.

Surface profilometry confirms the severe disruption, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm, a figure that indicates profound roughness. The contaminant film itself exhibits significant cracking, a mudflat pattern that suggests a brittle, desiccated composition, perhaps from a dried liquid residue. EDX analysis confirms the presence of exogenous elements—notably sodium, chlorine, and calcium—which are entirely inconsistent with the expected polymer chemistry. This contamination, it creates a surface that is optically diffuse and functionally unreliable for any precision application, its original properties entirely masked.

  Following the laser ablation process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminant layer has been removed with what one can only describe as surgical precision, revealing the pristine polystyrene substrate beneath. The surface, she is now entirely free of the previous carbonaceous film and particulate inclusions; the Ra value has been reduced to a notably smooth 0.7 µm, a restoration of over 85% in surface smoothness. What strikes one is the clarity with which the polymer's intrinsic micro-texture—a faint, uniform granularity from the injection molding process—is now visible, completely unobscured.

The cleaning efficacy is further evidenced by the absence of the EDX spectral peaks for sodium and chlorine, confirming the removal of the salt-based contaminants. There is no evidence of melting or polymer degradation, a critical finding that speaks to the excellent control of the laser parameters. The reflectivity has increased substantially, the surface now exhibiting a consistent, matte finish where once it was mottled and diffuse. This level of surface integrity restoration, it is essential for ensuring optimal adhesion in subsequent medical device coating operations or for maintaining signal fidelity in electronic components. The laser, it has achieved a functional restoration while preserving the material's inherent structural integrity.
