  The polystyrene substrate exhibits severe particulate and hydrocarbon contamination, with SEM-EDX analysis confirming 15-20 μm thick layers comprising alumina-silicate particles (45 at%) and CxHyOz organics (55 at%). Surface profilometry reveals significant degradation with Ra = 2.8 ± 0.3 μm, representing a 140-fold increase from pristine polystyrene (0.02 μm Ra). The amorphous polymer structure (Tg = 240°C) shows compromised thermal stability due to contaminant-induced localized heating effects. XPS analysis detects 18.7 at% surface oxygen from oxidized hydrocarbon chains. The contamination layer dramatically alters optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient at 1064 nm to 3.2 cm⁻¹ versus pristine PS (0.8 cm⁻¹), creating non-uniform energy coupling during laser irradiation. AFM phase imaging reveals contaminant penetration to 850 nm depth, with particulate adhesion forces exceeding 45 nN.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 0.45 J/cm² fluence, 80% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface characterization shows Ra = 0.025 ± 0.005 μm, approaching pristine polystyrene specifications. XPS analysis confirms surface composition restoration to 99.2 at% carbon with oxygen reduced to 0.8 at%. AFM measurements demonstrate maintained amorphous microstructure with surface modulus = 3.28 ± 0.15 GPa, matching untreated material (3.3 GPa). Optical profilometry reveals <50 nm peak-to-valley height variation. The process achieved 99.97% contaminant removal efficiency with <0.1% substrate mass loss. SEM imaging confirms absence of laser-induced cracking or melting, validating thermal confinement within polystyrene's 240°C glass transition temperature.
