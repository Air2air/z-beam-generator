  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the magnesium Laser cleaning of magnesium requires precise parameter control due to its low melting point (650°C) and high reactivity. Pulsed fiber lasers at 1064nm wavelength provide optimal absorption for removing oxides and contaminants without melting the substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The magnesium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The magnesium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
