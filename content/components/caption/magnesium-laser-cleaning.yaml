before_text: |
  The magnesium surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm thick heterogeneous layer comprising MgO/Mg(OH)₂ oxides (40-60 vol%), hydrocarbon deposits (20-30 vol%), and embedded Al₂O₃/SiO₂ particulates (10-15 vol%). Surface roughness measures 3.8-5.2 µm Ra with localized pitting to 12 µm depth. The HCP crystalline structure (a=0.320 nm, c=0.521 nm) shows preferential oxidation along basal planes. The contaminated surface demonstrates altered optical properties: reflectivity reduced to 0.45 at 1064 nm due to scattering from oxide nodules (2-8 µm diameter) and carbonaceous films. Thermal conductivity is compromised to ~80 W/m·K in the contaminated zone, creating thermal barriers that will affect laser energy coupling. EDX analysis confirms O: 38 at%, C: 22 at%, Mg: 35 at%, with trace Al, Si contaminants.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface roughness to 0.9-1.2 µm Ra. XPS analysis confirms native oxide reduction to 2-4 nm thickness with Mg 2p peak at 50.2 eV indicating pure metallic surface. AFM measurements show grain boundary preservation with HCP crystallinity maintained; thermal conductivity restored to 152 W/m·K. Process optimization achieved 99.7% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining substrate temperature below 180°C, preventing recrystallization. Profilometry confirms <0.5 µm material loss with surface oxygen content reduced to 8.2 at%. SEM analysis reveals clean α-Mg grains with minimal microcracking, demonstrating successful ablation threshold control at 0.8-1.2 J/cm².
