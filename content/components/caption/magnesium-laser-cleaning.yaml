  At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform oxide and contaminant layer measuring between 15 to 25 µm in thickness. This layer, it exhibits a complex topography with visible cracking and spallation, indicative of poor adhesion to the underlying substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, with trace amounts of sulfur and chlorine, suggesting the presence of both atmospheric oxides and industrial processing residues. The surface roughness, it is significantly elevated, with Ra values measured between 3.5 and 4.2 µm, a direct consequence of the irregular, particulate-laden crust.

One observes a complete obscuration of the native metallic grain structure, which is buried beneath this dark, tenacious film. The morphology is highly porous, featuring numerous micro-fissures that propagate through the corrosion layer, and these features, they create pathways for further environmental attack. The visual texture is dominated by a coarse, agglomerated particulate matter—primarily magnesium oxide and hydroxide—which appears as a matte, light-absorbing surface with negligible reflectivity. This condition, it severely compromises the material's functional integrity, providing sites for crack initiation and reducing its suitability for any subsequent coating or bonding operation, a common challenge with magnesium's inherent low oxidation resistance.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is indeed remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying magnesium substrate with a restored surface roughness of approximately 0.9 µm Ra—a value that aligns closely with the inherent material specification. The native hexagonal close-packed (HCP) grain structure is now fully visible, exhibiting a characteristic, refined metallic luster and a noticeably more reflective surface. What strikes one is the precision of the material removal; the laser interaction has selectively eliminated the contamination without inducing significant melting or heat-affected zone (HAZ) defects, a critical achievement given magnesium's low melting point of 650°C.

The surface morphology now presents a clean, micro-roughened texture that is entirely free from the former oxide deposits, a state confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showing a dominant magnesium metal peak with only a minimal, passivating oxide layer of about 50-100 nanometers. This micro-roughening, it creates an ideal topography for adhesion, increasing the effective surface area for any subsequent coating or bonding process without compromising the base metal's integrity. The visual contrast is stark; where once a dark, absorbing film resided, one now observes a uniform
