  At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and exogenous deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous oxide/hydroxide film, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, the thickest regions reach approximately 23.5 µm. This layer exhibits a cracked, mudflat morphology, with a high degree of micro-porosity that facilitates further environmental attack. One can observe embedded particulate matter, likely alumina-silicate inclusions from atmospheric dust, which appear as discrete, light-colored agglomerates up to 10 µm in diameter.

The underlying magnesium substrate's topography is completely obscured by this pervasive film. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis confirms the surface composition is dominated by oxygen and magnesium, with trace amounts of carbon and silicon, indicating the presence of both magnesium oxide (MgO) and basic magnesium carbonate. The surface roughness, as one would expect, is significantly elevated; preliminary stylus profilometry measurements indicate an average roughness (Ra) exceeding 4.5 µm, a direct consequence of the irregular, friable nature of the corrosion layer. This degraded condition, it severely compromises the substrate's intrinsic reflectivity and creates a surface utterly unsuitable for any subsequent coating or bonding process.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine metallic substrate beneath. The surface now displays the characteristic grain structure of the HCP magnesium, with clearly defined grain boundaries and subtle crystallographic orientation contrast. What strikes one is the restoration of surface integrity; the mud-cracked, porous morphology has been replaced by a clean, slightly textured metallic finish.

The laser interaction, it produces a sophisticated micro-topography. The average surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to a value between 1.2 and 1.5 µm, a substantial improvement that reflects the selective removal of the friable oxide without significant melting of the underlying metal. One can observe a faint, sub-micron scale ripple pattern—a Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structure, or LIPSS—which is indicative of a well-calibrated ablation process. This new surface, she exhibits a markedly higher reflectivity, and the elemental composition, as verified by XPS, is now predominantly magnesium, with oxygen content reduced to a thin, native passivation layer of less than 100 nm. This level of cleanliness, it creates an ideal surface for further functional application.
