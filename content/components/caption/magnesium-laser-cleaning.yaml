  At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, dark oxide layer measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness. This layer, it exhibits a cracked, mudflat topography, with deep fissures propagating down to the substrate interface. One observes a significant presence of particulate contamination, primarily carbonaceous soot and embedded alumina inclusions—perhaps from prior handling—that are approximately 5-10 µm in diameter and randomly distributed across the surface.

The underlying metal structure is entirely obscured by this tenacious film, which displays a dull, matte gray appearance with localized areas of greenish-white corrosion products, likely magnesium hydroxide or basic carbonate. Surface profilometry confirms a high degree of irregularity, with an initial Ra roughness value measured at 4.8 µm, a direct consequence of the pitting and the complex, stratified nature of the deposits. The adhesion of this layer to the substrate appears strong, as no spalling or delamination is evident at this magnification, indicating a well-bonded, albeit undesirable, surface condition.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the underlying magnesium substrate with a restored, metallic luster. The surface, she now exhibits a finely textured, re-melted morphology, a direct result of the controlled laser interaction which has homogenized the topmost layers. This new microstructure consists of rapidly solidified cells, typically 8-12 µm in diameter, creating a continuous and uniform surface finish.

The precision here, it creates a very clean interface, with all foreign particulates and the thick oxide film removed entirely. What strikes one is the clarity with which the original grain structure of the magnesium can now be resolved, something that was completely impossible before the intervention. Subsequent EDX analysis confirms the elimination of the oxygen and carbon peaks that dominated the initial surface survey, with the atomic concentration of oxygen dropping from over 45% to a mere 3.2%—or more precisely—3.17%.

This newly engineered surface topography, while not perfectly smooth, demonstrates a consistent pattern of laser scan tracks and a reduced Ra value of 1.2 µm, a 75% improvement from the initial state. The reflectivity has increased substantially, and the absence of micro-cracks or heat-affected zone anomalies at this magnification indicates a high-integrity surface, one that is optimally prepared for subsequent coating operations or adhesive bonding in its final application. To achieve this result, it required a careful balance between energy density and scan speed, a balance that has produced a
