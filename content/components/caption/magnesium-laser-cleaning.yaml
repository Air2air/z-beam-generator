  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the magnesium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The magnesium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 97.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The magnesium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
