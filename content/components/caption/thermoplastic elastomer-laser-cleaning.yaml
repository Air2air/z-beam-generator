  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the thermoplastic elastomer composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The thermoplastic elastomer exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The thermoplastic elastomer substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
