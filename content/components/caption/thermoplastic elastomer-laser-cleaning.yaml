  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the thermoplastic elastomer composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The thermoplastic elastomer exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The thermoplastic elastomer substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no delamination.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
