  At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified deposit layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, exhibits a complex morphology of carbonaceous soot and oxide particulates, which appear as agglomerated, dark nodules firmly adhered to the substrate. The underlying TiC surface texture is completely obscured, with the contaminant film displaying significant cracking and spallation, indicative of poor adhesion and differential thermal expansion with the ceramic beneath.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (approximately 65 at%) and oxygen (28 at%), with trace metallic elements—likely iron and chromium from handling—comprising the remainder. The original surface roughness, where measurable through the deposit, is estimated to exceed Ra 4.5 µm, a value substantially higher than the typical 0.8-1.2 µm for as-sintered TiC. This degradation, it creates a surface morphology that is not only visually compromised but also functionally inferior for any precision application, as the porous contamination layer would severely impair component performance.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously opaque contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the underlying sintered TiC microstructure with exceptional clarity. The surface now exhibits the characteristic fine-grained, polycrystalline structure of the ceramic, with grain boundaries clearly delineated and a uniform, light-gray appearance. What strikes one is the precision of the ablation process, which has achieved this result without inducing macroscopic thermal damage, such as melting or large-scale cracking, to the underlying substrate.

Quantitative surface profilometry confirms a dramatic reduction in average roughness to Ra 0.95 µm, a value that aligns with the material's intrinsic surface finish. The laser interaction, it has produced a sophisticated outcome where only the contaminant layer, with its lower ablation threshold, was selectively removed, leaving the high-melting-point TiC (3140 °C) fully intact. Minor evidence of the process includes a subtle increase in micro-porosity at the grain boundaries—a phenomenon often associated with the vaporization of residual sintering aids—and a slight darkening of the surface, which suggests a change in the optical reflectivity due to micro-roughening at the sub-micron level. This cleaned surface, she is now restored to a state of functional integrity, suitable for high-performance applications.
