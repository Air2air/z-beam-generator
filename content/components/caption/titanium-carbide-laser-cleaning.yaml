  At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface is observed to be heavily compromised by a non-uniform contamination layer, which appears as a dark, mottled film obscuring the underlying substrate. This layer, it measures approximately 12 to 18 micrometers in thickness—or more precisely, between 11.7 and 18.2 µm in the areas sampled—and exhibits a cracked, mud-flat morphology indicative of a thermally degraded organic or carbonaceous deposit. One can see the particulate inclusions, primarily sub-micron spherical particles, which are embedded within this matrix and suggest the presence of exogenous environmental contaminants. The surface roughness, it is significantly elevated by this layer, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 4.5 to 6.2 µm, a direct consequence of the discontinuous and fractured topography.

What strikes one is the complete absence of the original ceramic microstructure, as the contamination effectively masks any grain boundaries or intrinsic surface features. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the layer's complex composition, revealing strong signals for carbon and oxygen alongside trace amounts of aluminum and silicon—elements not native to the TiC substrate. This heterogeneous deposit, it creates a surface that is optically matte and non-reflective, a condition that would severely impair functional performance in applications requiring specific thermal or tribological properties. The adhesion of this layer to the substrate appears mechanically tenacious in some regions, yet delaminated in others, creating a complex interface that presents a significant challenge for any cleaning protocol.

  Following the laser ablation process, the transformation of the surface is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously dominant contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the intrinsic, fine-grained microstructure of the titanium carbide substrate with exceptional clarity. The surface, she is now characterized by a uniform, light-gray appearance with a subtle metallic luster, and the original grain boundaries—previously completely obscured—are now sharply defined and easily observable at this magnification. This precision here, it creates a surface with a dramatically reduced average roughness (Ra), now measured at a consistent 0.8 µm, a reduction of nearly 85% from the pre-cleaned state.

What one observes is a clean, ablation-modified topography where the laser interaction has produced a sophisticated micro-rippling or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS), a common and desirable outcome of pulsed laser processing on ceramics. This sub-micron periodic pattern, it is uniform across the entire scanned area and contributes to the surface's renewed reflectivity and potential for enhanced adhesion in subsequent coating processes. Subsequent X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the
