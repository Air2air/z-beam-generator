# Caption Content for Titanium Carbide
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-10 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a matte, dark gray film with a mottled texture, composed of embedded carbonaceous soot and fine metallic particles from engine wear. The contaminants form agglomerates that mask the underlying ceramic's inherent microstructure.

The surface topography is dominated by these particulate agglomerates, which create a rough, discontinuous landscape. The contamination does not adhere uniformly, resulting in a patchy appearance with some areas showing thicker, crust-like deposits. This layer significantly attenuates the surface's natural reflectivity and completely conceals the fine-grain, polycrystalline structure of the titanium carbide substrate.

  Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The opaque contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the true, unblemished titanium carbide substrate. The previously hidden, fine-grained polycrystalline structure is now fully visible and distinct.

The surface now exhibits a uniform, light gray metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries. The laser process has effectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the underlying ceramic, restoring its original topography. The result is a clean, well-defined surface free from residual films or particulate matter.
