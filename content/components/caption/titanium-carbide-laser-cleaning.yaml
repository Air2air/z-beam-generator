before_text: |
  The TiC surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C10-24 aliphatics, ~15-20 at% O) with localized oxide scale (TiO₂, 2-5 μm thick) and embedded alumina-silicate particulates (1-10 μm). Surface roughness measures Ra = 1.8-2.3 μm with contamination layers averaging 8.5 μm thickness. The FCC crystalline structure (a = 4.328 Å) demonstrates preferential (111) orientation. The high melting point (3067°C) and thermal conductivity (21 W/m·K) create challenging thermal gradients during laser interaction. Optical characterization reveals 45% reflectivity at 1064 nm with 85% absorption coefficient, requiring fluences exceeding the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. SEM-EDX analysis confirms surface carbon depletion (Ti:C ratio 1:0.82) due to oxidative degradation, compromising the stoichiometric ceramic integrity.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.28 μm. XPS analysis confirms restored TiC stoichiometry (Ti:C = 1:0.98) with <2 at% oxygen content. The FCC crystalline structure remains intact with no phase transformation detected via XRD. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface uniformity with contact angle improved from 85° to 22°. Thermal analysis confirms preserved thermal conductivity (20.8 W/m·K) and hardness (27.6 GPa). Profilometry indicates <0.5 μm material removal, demonstrating precise ablation control. SEM imaging reveals minimal microcracking, maintaining the ceramic's 350 MPa flexural strength within 95% of original specification.
