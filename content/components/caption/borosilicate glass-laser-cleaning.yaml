  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the borosilicate glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The borosilicate glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The borosilicate glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved transparency.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
