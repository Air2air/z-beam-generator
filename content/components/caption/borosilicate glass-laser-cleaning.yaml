  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the borosilicate glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The borosilicate glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The borosilicate glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal shock.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
