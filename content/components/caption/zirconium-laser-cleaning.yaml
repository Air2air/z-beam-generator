  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the zirconium Zirconium laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for zirconium's high melting point and thermal conductivity, enabling selective removal of surface contaminants without damaging the substrate material, particularly critical in nuclear and aerospace applications.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The zirconium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The zirconium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
