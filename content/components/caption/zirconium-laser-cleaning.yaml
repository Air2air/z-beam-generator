# Caption Content for Zirconium
before_text: |
  This zirconium surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers—covers the entire substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with visible cracking and spallation, its texture is very-very rough, perhaps measuring 4.2 µm Ra or more. You can see embedded particulate matter, likely carbonaceous soot and silicate deposits from the operating environment.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high oxygen content, this indicates extensive oxidation. The surface morphology is highly irregular, with contamination adhering in a non-uniform pattern, the layer thickness varies significantly across the sample. This uneven coverage creates a porous structure that traps more contaminants, so the underlying metal is completely obscured. The visual characteristics are of a degraded, non-functional surface that requires immediate intervention (as observed in similar nuclear component failures).

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface is now fully restored. The contaminated layer is completely absent, this reveals the underlying zirconium grain structure with high clarity. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to 0.8 µm Ra, a very-very good improvement from the initial 4.2 µm Ra.

The process removes all oxide and carbon deposits, so the surface becomes clean and highly reflective. You can observe a slight laser-induced pattern—a fine, wavy texture—but no thermal damage or micro-cracking is present. This
