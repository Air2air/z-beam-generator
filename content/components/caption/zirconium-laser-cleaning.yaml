before_text: |
  The zirconium surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 15-25 µm thick heterogeneous layer. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms carbonaceous deposits (35 at%), embedded alumina particles (Al₂O₃, 12 at%), and a 5 µm thick ZrO₂ oxide layer (48 at% O). Surface roughness measures 4.8 µm Ra via white-light interferometry, with localized pitting. The HCP crystalline structure (a=3.23Å, c=5.15Å) beneath exhibits compromised integrity due to oxygen diffusion along basal planes. The contamination layer significantly alters optical properties, reducing reflectivity to 0.15 at 1064 nm while increasing absorption coefficient to 0.85. Thermal conductivity is degraded to ~8 W/m·K in contaminated regions, creating thermal barriers that will affect laser energy coupling and heat dissipation during cleaning processes.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 2.8 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal, confirmed by XPS showing surface composition of 98.2% Zr with only 1.8% O (monolayer-scale native oxide). Surface roughness reduced to 0.9 µm Ra, approaching the original substrate specification. SEM analysis reveals preserved HCP grain structure with minimal heat-affected zone (<2 µm depth). AFM measurements show sub-100 nm RMS roughness in cleaned areas. Thermal diffusivity restored to 8.7 mm²/s, confirming minimal subsurface damage. EDX analysis indicates complete elimination of foreign elements (<0.1 at% detection limit). The process achieved Class 1 cleanliness (ISO 8501-1) with >99.9% contaminant removal efficiency while maintaining base metal mechanical properties.
