  This zirconium surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer covers the entire surface, this layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely—14.7 µm in thickness. The oxide appears as a dark, mottled crust with visible cracking and spallation across the sample. Surface roughness measurements confirm this irregularity, showing Ra values between 3.8 and 4.2 µm.

The contamination layer contains significant particulate deposits embedded within the oxide matrix. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis identifies these particulates as carbonaceous soot and silicate particles, likely from industrial processing environments. These embedded contaminants create a highly irregular surface topography with poor reflectivity. The underlying metal shows no visible features because the oxide layer completely obscures the original surface finish. This condition would negatively impact component performance in nuclear applications where surface purity is critical.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface transformation. The contaminated oxide layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying zirconium substrate with its characteristic metallic luster restored. Surface roughness measurements now show Ra values of 0.8 µm, representing approximately 80% reduction from the pre-cleaned condition. The cleaned surface exhibits a uniform, light gray appearance with fine machining marks visible again.

The cleaning process eliminates all visible contamination—both the thick oxide layer and embedded particulate matter are absent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms this visual observation,
