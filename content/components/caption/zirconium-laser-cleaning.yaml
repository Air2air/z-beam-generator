# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the zirconium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The zirconium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 98.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The zirconium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
