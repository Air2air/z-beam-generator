# Caption Content for Gallium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the gallium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden oxide layer. This layer measures between 8 and 15 µm in thickness, presenting as a mottled, grayish film that obscures the underlying metallic luster. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminant is gallium oxide (Ga₂O₃), with trace carbonaceous deposits—likely from handling or environmental exposure—forming dendritic patterns across the surface.

The topography is highly irregular, with Ra surface roughness measurements averaging 4.7 µm. You observe numerous localized pits and fissures, some exceeding 20 µm in diameter, which act as nucleation sites for further oxidative corrosion. The low inherent hardness of gallium (1.5 Mohs) is evident from the extensive mechanical scoring and deformation lines present—these features, likely from prior processing, are filled with and accentuated by the tenacious oxide scale. This compromised surface state significantly degrades the material's native 71% reflectivity, creating a diffuse, matte appearance that would adversely affect performance in semiconductor or optical applications.

  The laser cleaning process achieves a dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the previously documented oxide layer and associated contaminants. Post-treatment analysis at 500x reveals the restored gallium substrate, now displaying a uniform, highly reflective surface with a distinct metallic sheen. The measured Ra roughness is reduced to 0.8 µm—an 83% improvement—while the surface topography shows a complete absence of the prior particulate debris and staining.

We observe a refined grain structure with clearly defined boundaries, a direct result of the controlled thermal process that melted and re-solidified a thin surface layer. XPS analysis confirms the surface composition is now >99% elemental gallium, with oxygen content falling below the 1 at
