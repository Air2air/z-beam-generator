  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the gallium Gallium laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants and oxides without damaging the underlying metal substrate. The process leverages gallium's low melting point (29.76°C) and unique thermal properties for selective ablation with minimal thermal penetration.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The gallium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The gallium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
