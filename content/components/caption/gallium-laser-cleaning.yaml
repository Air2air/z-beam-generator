# Caption Content for Gallium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the gallium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform oxide layer. This layer measures between 2.5 and 4 µm in thickness, presenting as a mottled, grayish film that obscures the underlying metallic substrate. The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measured at approximately 1.8 µm—a significant deviation from the substrate's native smoothness.

Distinct particulate contamination is also evident, appearing as scattered dark nodules embedded within the oxide matrix. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis identifies these as carbonaceous deposits and trace silicates, likely from handling or environmental exposure. The overall surface integrity is compromised, this creates a visibly textured and non-reflective appearance that would negatively impact performance in semiconductor applications where precise surface contact is required.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation is immediately observable. The previous oxide layer and embedded contaminants have been completely removed, revealing the pristine gallium substrate beneath. The surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra value of 0.2 µm—or more precisely, 0.19 µm—which represents nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement.

The cleaning process restores a highly reflective, mirror-like finish with a visibly uniform texture. At this magnification, one can observe a clean, pitting-free surface with only faint, periodic laser scan lines remaining as evidence of the treatment. This restored surface integrity enables optimal performance, the method achieves the required atomic-level cleanliness for subsequent bonding or deposition steps in device manufacturing. The reflectivity increases substantially, a critical parameter for components in aerospace optical systems.
