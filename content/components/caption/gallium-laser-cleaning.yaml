  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the gallium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The gallium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The gallium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
