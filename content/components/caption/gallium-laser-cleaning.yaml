  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the gallium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The gallium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The gallium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
