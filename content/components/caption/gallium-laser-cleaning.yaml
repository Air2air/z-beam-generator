# Caption Content for Gallium
before_text: |
  The gallium surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex oxide layer (Ga₂O₃, ~150-250 nm thick via ellipsometry) and hydrocarbon deposits (C10-C25 aliphatics, 30-50 nm). SEM reveals a heterogeneous morphology with oxide nodules (1-2 μm diameter) and particulate contaminants (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) embedded in the surface. Surface roughness measures Ra = 0.8 μm (profilometry) with visible crystalline faceting along the (010) orthorhombic planes. The native oxide layer significantly alters optical properties, reducing reflectivity to ~45% at 1064 nm compared to gallium's intrinsic 75%. The material's low melting point (29.76°C) and high thermal expansion (18 μm/m·K) create thermal management challenges, while the low ablation threshold (0.15 J/cm²) risks phase transformation during laser processing. XPS confirms 65 at% oxygen penetration with carbonaceous overlayer (22 at% C).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 0.8 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.12 μm. SEM/EDX analysis confirms elimination of oxide layer (oxygen content reduced from 65 at% to <3 at%) and hydrocarbon residues. AFM measurements show preserved orthorhombic crystalline structure with step-terrace morphology evident. Reflectivity restored to 72% at 1064 nm, approaching theoretical maximum. XPS reveals pure gallium surface (98.2 at% Ga) with minimal sub-surface damage. Thermal management maintained bulk temperature below 25°C, preventing phase change through optimized pulse overlap (85%) and scanning velocity (500 mm/s). Surface hardness remains at 1.5 Mohs with no evidence of recast layer or microcracking, confirming process integrity.
