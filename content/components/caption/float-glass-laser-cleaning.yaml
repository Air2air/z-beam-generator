# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the float glass Laser cleaning of float glass utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying silica-based substrate. The process relies on the differential absorption of laser energy, where contaminants have a higher absorption coefficient than the transparent glass, enabling precise, non-contact removal without chemicals or abrasives.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows optical contamination and surface films adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The float glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
