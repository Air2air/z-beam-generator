  The float glass surface exhibits severe particulate and hydrocarbon contamination, with SEM-EDX analysis revealing 15-20 μm thick layers comprising calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) crystallites (5-10 μm diameter), silica dust (SiO₂, 1-5 μm), and hydrocarbon films (C₁₀H₂₂-C₂₀H₄₂). Surface profilometry measures Ra = 2.8 μm with localized contamination peaks reaching 25 μm. The soda-lime-silica composition (72% SiO₂, 13% Na₂O, 10% CaO) presents critical thermal challenges: low thermal conductivity (1.0 W/m·K) promotes localized heating, while the high thermal expansion coefficient (8.5 × 10⁻⁶/°C) creates stress concentration risks. The amorphous structure lacks grain boundaries, making it susceptible to thermal shock. Contaminants significantly alter optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient from 0.1 cm⁻¹ to 2.5 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm wavelength, creating preferential absorption sites. AFM analysis shows contamination adhesion forces of 150-300 nN, with hydrocarbon films forming continuous 500 nm layers.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 J/cm² fluence (below the 10 J/cm² damage threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal, confirmed by XPS showing surface composition restored to 71.8% SiO₂, 13.2% Na₂O, 9.9% CaO. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.6 nm, approaching pristine glass (0.5 nm Ra). AFM measurements show maximum peak-to-valley height reduction from 25 μm to 1.2 nm. The process preserved the amorphous structure with no evidence of crystallization or microcracking. Optical transmissivity recovered to 91.8% of theoretical maximum. Thermal analysis confirmed no residual stress formation, with Young's modulus maintained at 70 GPa. Laser parameters were optimized using the material's thermal diffusivity (0.5 mm²/s) and specific heat (840 J/kg·K) to prevent thermal shock. SEM-EDX verification shows zero contaminant residues, achieving semiconductor-grade cleanliness specifications.
