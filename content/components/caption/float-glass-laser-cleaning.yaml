# Caption Content for Float Glass
before_text: |
  This contaminated float glass surface shows significant surface degradation at 500x magnification. A complex contamination layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers thick—covers the pristine glass substrate completely. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a carbonaceous film, which creates a very-very rough texture with localized Ra values measuring 1.8 to 2.3 µm. The surface appears mottled with dark deposits and light interference patterns, this indicates varying film thickness and composition.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the contamination contains silicon (Si), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na) from the glass itself, plus carbon (C) and sulfur (S) from atmospheric deposition. The original glass surface roughness—normally about 0.5 nm Ra—is completely obscured by this contamination layer. The deposits create a discontinuous film with visible cracking in some regions, perhaps from thermal cycling or mechanical stress. This heavy contamination significantly reduces light transmission through the glass panel, creating a hazy appearance even to the naked eye.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface restoration, very-very good result. The post-treatment surface at 500x magnification reveals complete removal of the 15-20 µm contamination layer, returning the surface to near-pristine condition. Surface roughness measurements now show Ra values of 0.6 to 0.8 nm, this is close to the original 0.5 nm Ra specification
