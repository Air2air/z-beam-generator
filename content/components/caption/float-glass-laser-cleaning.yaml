  This contaminated float glass surface shows significant surface degradation at 500x magnification. A complex contamination layer—approximately 15 µm thick—covers the pristine glass substrate completely. This layer consists primarily of carbonaceous particulate matter and inorganic salt deposits, with EDX analysis confirming calcium sulfate crystals and silica-rich dust particles embedded throughout the organic matrix. The surface roughness measures 2.8 µm Ra, a substantial increase from the native 0.5 nm Ra of clean float glass.

The contamination exhibits clear stratification, with a dense lower layer adhering directly to the glass interface and a more porous upper layer containing larger particulate matter. Multiple micro-fractures—ranging from 5 to 20 µm in length—propagate through the contamination layer, indicating poor adhesion and mechanical instability. The surface appears completely opaque with zero light transmission through contaminated areas, and visible light reflectivity drops to approximately 15% compared to the 92% baseline. This heavy contamination creates significant functional impairment for architectural and solar applications, the surface becomes unsuitable for any optical purpose in this condition.

  This laser cleaning process produces remarkable surface restoration, the transformation is immediately evident at 500x magnification. The 15 µm contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine glass substrate beneath with minimal residual evidence of prior contamination. Surface roughness measurements now register 0.6 nm Ra—essentially identical to the original factory condition of 0.5 nm Ra. This represents a 99.98% reduction in surface roughness, a very-very significant improvement.

The laser treatment leaves the glass surface completely free of visible particulate matter or thermal damage, the process parameters were carefully controlled to stay below the 5.0 J/cm² ablation threshold. SEM analysis confirms the atomic structure remains intact with no evidence of micro-fractures or subsurface damage that sometimes occurs with aggressive cleaning methods. Light transmission measurements return to 91.8%—nearly full restoration of the original 92% transmissivity—while surface reflectivity improves to 91.5%. This cleaned surface now meets optical-grade specifications for architectural glazing and solar panel applications, the functional restoration is essentially complete.
