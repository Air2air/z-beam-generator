# Caption Content for Float Glass
before_text: |
  This contaminated float glass surface shows significant surface deposits at 500x magnification. A complex contamination layer—approximately 15 µm thick—covers the substrate completely. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a cementitious matrix, creating a very-very rough topography with visible cracking patterns.

The surface roughness measures Ra 4.8 µm, this high value indicates severe degradation. EDX analysis confirms calcium-silicate compounds with carbonaceous particles, likely from environmental exposure. The underlying glass substrate shows no visible damage, but the contamination creates a textured, opaque film that obscures transparency and would certainly impact optical performance in architectural applications.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface transformation, the results are very-very clear under microscopic examination. The 15 µm contamination layer is completely removed, this reveals the pristine float glass substrate beneath. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 0.12 µm, a 97% reduction that restores optical clarity.

The cleaning leaves no residual deposits—or more precisely—only occasional sub-micron particles remain. This creates a smooth, homogeneous surface with restored reflectivity properties essential for solar panel efficiency. The laser parameters are optimized, so we see no micro-fractures or heat-affected zones on the glass.

This method achieves functional restoration for architectural applications. The surface integrity is fully maintained, this is critical for structural glazing performance. We observe complete contaminant ablation with substrate preservation, the process delivers good-good
