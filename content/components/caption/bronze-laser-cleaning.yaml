# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the bronze metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The bronze exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The bronze substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
