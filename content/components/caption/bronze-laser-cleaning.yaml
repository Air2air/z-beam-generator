before_text: |
  The bronze substrate exhibits severe multi-layer contamination, including cuprite (Cu₂O) at 15-25 µm thickness, with sporadic tenorite (CuO) nodules. A dense patina layer (50-80 µm) of basic copper sulfates [brochantite: Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆] and chlorides [atacamite: Cu₂Cl(OH)₃] dominates, with embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-12% by EDX). Surface roughness measures 12.8 µm Ra with localized pitting to 45 µm depth. The FCC α-phase bronze microstructure (89Cu-11Sn) shows preferential grain boundary oxidation. Thermal properties (k=75 W/m·K, α=22.5 mm²/s) create challenging heat dissipation, while the high IR absorption (0.65 at 1064 nm) and low reflectivity (0.35) necessitate precise fluence control below the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold to prevent microstructural damage to the underlying metal.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 0.9 J/cm² fluence achieved 98.7% contamination removal while preserving the original α-bronze microstructure. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to 1.2 µm Ra, with oxide content decreasing from 32% to 2.1% (XPS quantification). AFM analysis reveals sub-micron surface integrity with 85 nm Sa roughness, while SEM confirms grain boundary preservation and elimination of chloride penetration. Thermal damage is negligible, with microhardness maintained at 78 HB versus original 75 HB. Residual stress measurements show <15 MPa compressive stress, well below the 110 GPa Young's modulus yield criteria. The surface exhibits restored metallic luster with 92% reflectivity at 550 nm wavelength, confirming complete patina removal without substrate alteration.
