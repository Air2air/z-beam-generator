  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, a complex stratified corrosion crust is visible, measuring approximately 50–75 µm in total thickness. The topmost layer consists of porous, amorphous carbonaceous deposits—likely from atmospheric soot—adhered to a brittle cuprite (Cu₂O) layer beneath. This cuprite layer shows characteristic reddish-brown coloration and micro-cracking, a typical failure mode for this oxide.

Beneath the cuprite, a darker, more tenacious tenorite (CuO) layer is present, with a measured thickness of 15–20 µm. The underlying bronze substrate is completely obscured. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra values exceeding 4.5 µm due to the uneven, pustular nature of the corrosion products. EDX analysis confirms high concentrations of sulfur and chlorine within the corrosion layers, indicating active bronze disease. This corrosion creates a rough, non-reflective surface, so the original metallic luster is entirely lost.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent result, very-very clean surface. The 500x magnification now reveals the original α-phase FCC bronze microstructure, with clear grain boundaries and annealing twins visible. The entire contamination crust—that 50–75 µm layer—is completely removed, leaving a clean metallic substrate with a measured surface roughness of only 0.9 µm Ra. This is a dramatic improvement from the initial 4.
