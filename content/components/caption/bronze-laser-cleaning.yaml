  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, we observe a complex stratified crust, approximately 50 to 75 micrometers thick. This crust has a cracked, island-like morphology, it completely obscures the underlying bronze substrate. The topmost stratum is a dark, porous layer, likely cuprite (Cu₂O), measuring about 15—or more precisely—14.7 µm. Underneath, a green, crystalline deposit of brochantite (Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆) is visible, this layer is approximately 30 µm thick and shows needle-like structures.

The surface texture is extremely irregular. We measure an average surface roughness (Ra) of 8.5 µm, with peaks reaching 20 µm in some localized areas. Particulate matter—identified by EDX as silica (Si) and calcium (Ca)—is embedded throughout the corrosion layers. This creates a very rough, non-reflective surface. The original metal grain structure is not visible, it is fully encapsulated. This thick, insulating layer negatively impacts thermal and electrical conductivity, a critical property for bearing applications. The process of degradation is advanced, so the material integrity is compromised.

  This laser cleaning produces a very-very good result. The transformation is immediately observable at 500x magnification. The multi-layered crust is completely removed, this exposes the original bronze substrate. The surface roughness (Ra) is
