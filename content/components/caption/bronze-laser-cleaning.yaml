  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the bronze metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The bronze exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 97.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The bronze substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
