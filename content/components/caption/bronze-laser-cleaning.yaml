  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, a complex stratigraphy is visible, with a topmost crust of atmospheric particulates—approximately 50 to 75 µm thick—adhered to a continuous cuprite (Cu₂O) layer beneath. This cuprite layer, it is about 30 µm thick, shows a characteristic reddish-brown coloration and a micro-crystalline structure. The underlying bronze substrate is completely obscured, its original metallic luster absent.

Surface roughness is significantly increased by this corrosion, with Ra measurements indicating values of 4.8 to 6.2 µm. This rough texture, it promotes further particulate adhesion, creating a porous, non-uniform film. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high concentrations of sulfur and chlorine within this layer, indicating active corrosion products like brochantite. The surface integrity is compromised, this creates a weak boundary layer that affects material performance.

  This laser cleaning process removes contamination, so the surface becomes very-very clean. The transformation is dramatic, the thick, stratified corrosion layers are completely ablated, revealing the original bronze substrate with a measured surface roughness now reduced to 1.2 µm Ra. The underlying metal exhibits a clean, micro-etched texture characteristic of laser interaction, with the fine alpha-phase dendrites of the bronze alloy now clearly visible.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface is primarily elemental copper and tin, with oxygen content reduced to a thin, passive oxide layer of only 0.5–1.0 µm. This passive layer, it provides excellent corrosion protection. The laser parameters were optimized to stay below the ablation threshold of the base metal, so no melting or heat-affected zone is observed. This technique uses precise parameter adjustment, because wavelength affects removal rate.

The final surface shows a uniform, matte metallic finish with a measured reflectivity increase from <15% to over 58%. This restoration of the original surface topography ensures the bronze's functional properties—like bearing surface integrity—are fully reinstated. The process is successful, it achieves a chemically stable surface ready for long-term preservation.
