  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the plywood wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The plywood exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The plywood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
