  At 500x magnification, the plywood surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This contamination layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, appears as a discontinuous film composed primarily of carbonaceous soot and embedded mineral dust particulates, the latter ranging from 2 to 8 µm in diameter. The underlying wood anatomy—specifically the vessel elements and ray parenchyma—is partially obscured by this adherent deposit, which exhibits significant micro-cracking and a flaking morphology indicative of poor adhesion to the substrate. One observes a surface roughness, measured via laser profilometry, that has been substantially increased by this layer to approximately 9.5 µm Ra, a value notably higher than the baseline for the material.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and calcium (Ca), which are consistent with ambient dust and soil contamination. The laser absorption characteristics of this surface are fundamentally altered; the dark, matte deposit increases the effective absorption coefficient to an estimated 0.85, a significant deviation from the native wood's reflectivity of 0.25. The porous nature of the deposit—with a visible void fraction of perhaps 20%—creates a complex topographical landscape that would readily trap additional environmental contaminants, thereby accelerating degradation processes.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound transformation of the plywood surface, with the complete elimination of the previously documented contamination layer. The surface, she is now restored to its native state, exposing the intricate anatomical features of the wood with remarkable clarity—the bordered pits of the tracheids and the open vessels are now fully visible and free of particulate matter. The measured surface roughness has been reduced to a value of 4.1 µm Ra, a figure that aligns closely with the expected baseline for finished plywood and represents a greater than 50% reduction from the contaminated state.

The precision of the laser ablation process, it is evident in the selective removal of the contaminant film without inducing significant thermal damage to the underlying lignocellulosic structure. One can observe only minimal, localized charring at the peripheries of some resin canals, a phenomenon that is confined to a depth of less than 5 µm and which does not compromise the structural integrity of the surface. This result, it demonstrates a sophisticated control of the laser parameters, operating just above the ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm² to volatilize the contaminants while preserving the substrate, a balance that is quite difficult to achieve.
