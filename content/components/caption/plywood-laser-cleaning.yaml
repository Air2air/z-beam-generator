# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the plywood wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The plywood exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The plywood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
