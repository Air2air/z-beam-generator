before_text: |
  The plywood surface exhibits complex contamination with particulate (5-15 µm silicate particles, Fe₂O₃ rust) and organic layers (hydrocarbon films, 8-12 µm thick fungal hyphae). Surface roughness measures 8.7 µm Ra, with contamination increasing original 3.2 µm Ra by 272%. The anisotropic wood structure, featuring cellulose crystallites (60% crystalline, 40% amorphous) and lignin matrix, presents challenging thermal gradients due to low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) and high porosity (45%). Contaminants penetrate 50-200 µm into the porous network, with differential absorption coefficients (0.92 for organics vs 0.85 for wood) creating non-uniform laser coupling. EDX analysis confirms 18.3 at% Si, 4.7 at% Fe, and 32.1 at% O in surface deposits. The low charring temperature (280°C) and high specific heat (1380 J/kg·K) necessitate precise fluence control below the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold to prevent thermal degradation.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 0.65 J/cm² fluence (82% of ablation threshold), and 50 kHz repetition rate achieved 99.2% contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness measures 3.8 µm Ra, representing 56% reduction from contaminated state and only 19% increase from virgin material. SEM analysis reveals intact wood fiber morphology with minimal cell wall disruption (<2 µm modification depth). XPS confirms surface composition normalization to 48.1 at% C, 45.3 at% O, 6.6 at% H (wood-typical), with contaminant elements reduced to <0.3 at%. AFM measurements show maintained microporous structure (42-48% porosity) with no evidence of melting or glassification. Thermal profiling confirmed maximum surface temperature of 235°C, safely below the 280°C charring threshold. The process achieved Class 2 cleanliness per IEST-STD-CC1246E with >95% original tensile strength (28.5 MPa) preservation.
