  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the plywood Technical overview of Plywood, C6H10O5+Adhesive, for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction, and industrial applications in surface preparation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The plywood exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The plywood substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
