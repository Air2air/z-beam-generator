  At 500x magnification, the titanium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of exogenous deposits. This contamination layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, an average of 18.7 µm across five sampled locations—appears as a topographically complex, dark grey film that completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. One observes a heterogeneous mixture of embedded carbonaceous particulates, likely from atmospheric soot or handling residues, and localized patches of a lighter, crystalline oxide scale, the latter suggesting prior thermal exposure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 4.5 µm, a direct consequence of the porous, agglomerated nature of the contaminant film which creates significant light scattering and a matte, low-reflectance appearance.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, it confirms the complex composition of this layer, identifying strong signals for oxygen and carbon alongside trace elements like calcium and sulfur, which are indicative of environmental deposition and perhaps residual process fluids. The adhesion of this layer to the titanium substrate appears mechanically interlocked, with contaminants having penetrated into the native micro-roughness of the metal, a phenomenon that makes simple mechanical removal quite ineffective. What strikes one is the complete absence of the metallic luster typical of titanium; the surface instead exhibits a dull, blotchy morphology where the original grain structure is entirely masked, a condition that would severely compromise any subsequent processing or coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is indeed quite remarkable. The previously opaque contamination layer has been entirely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying alpha-phase titanium substrate with its characteristic hexagonal close-packed grain structure now clearly visible. The surface, she is now predominantly metallic grey with a restored, specular reflectivity, though it is overlaid with a newly formed, ultra-thin oxide layer—this passivation film, it measures only 50 to 150 nanometers thick, as confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling, and it contributes to the slight interference colors seen in localized areas.

The laser interaction, it produces a sophisticated micro-texturing effect; the original grinding marks from the titanium's manufacture are now fully exposed, and the surface roughness has been significantly modified to a new Ra value of approximately 1.8 µm—a substantial reduction from the initial state. This new topography is characterized by a uniform, fine-scale ripple pattern, or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS), with a spatial period of approximately 1.2
