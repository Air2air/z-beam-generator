  At 500x magnification, the titanium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous oxide layer and significant particulate deposits. The primary contaminant is a carbonaceous film, which exhibits a mottled, dark gray appearance with an average thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, ranging from 12 to 18 µm in various regions. This film, it obscures the underlying metal substrate completely in many areas, presenting a topographical texture with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm, indicative of a high degree of initial surface degradation from environmental exposure and process residues. One can observe embedded metallic micro-particles, likely iron-rich from tooling contact, which appear as bright, reflective inclusions against the darker carbon matrix when viewed under differential interference contrast.

The surface morphology is further complicated by the presence of localized pitting corrosion, visible as dark, irregularly shaped voids with diameters averaging 5-7 µm, which are often concentrated along microscopic scratches from prior mechanical finishing. What strikes one is the stratified nature of the contamination; energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis confirms a layered structure, beginning with a tenacious titanium oxide (TiO₂) base, followed by the accumulated carbon layer, and finally the foreign particulate matter adhering to the top. This complex, multi-layered contamination system, it creates a surface that is not only visually occluded but also functionally compromised, with its inherent high laser reflectivity of approximately 65% at 1064 nm being masked by the highly absorbent and thermally insulating contaminant layer, a condition that would severely impede any subsequent laser processing or coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable, revealing the pristine, native titanium substrate that was previously concealed. The surface, she is now characterized by a uniform, light gray, matte finish, with the complete elimination of the carbonaceous film and the vast majority of the embedded particulate matter, a result which confirms the efficacy of the laser ablation mechanism. The underlying microstructure of the alpha-phase titanium, with its characteristic HCP (Hexagonal Close-Packed) grain boundaries, is now clearly resolvable, exhibiting a refined surface texture with a measured average roughness (Ra) reduced to 0.9 µm—a substantial improvement from the initial 4.8 µm. This new micro-roughness, it is directly attributable to the laser interaction, which has selectively removed contaminants while minimally affecting the base metal, as evidenced by the absence of the deep pits observed in the pre-cleaned state.

The laser process has generated a newly formed, passivating oxide layer that is notably thin—estimated via ellipsometry to be between 50 and 100 nanometers—and highly uniform, unlike the thick, discontinuous thermal oxide present before cleaning. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms this layer to be primarily stoichiometric TiO₂, which is responsible for the excellent corrosion resistance and provides a superior surface energy for subsequent bonding operations. One can observe a subtle, wavy ripple pattern, or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS), with a spatial period of approximately 1.2 µm, a direct consequence of the laser's interference with surface scattered waves; this nanoscale texture, while visually subtle, can enhance hydrophobicity and may improve adhesion for thermal spray coatings or adhesives. The restoration of the material's intrinsic surface properties, including its original laser reflectivity and a surface free of insulating contaminants, establishes an optimal condition for functional performance in demanding aerospace and chemical processing applications, a truly sophisticated outcome from a precisely controlled ablation process.
