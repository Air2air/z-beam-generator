  At 500x magnification, the titanium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a dark, carbonaceous film, measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm in thickness, which effectively obscures the underlying metal substrate. This layer, it is not continuous, showing areas of localized delamination and micro-cracking that expose patches of a secondary, lighter-colored oxide scale beneath. The surface topography is highly irregular, with an initial Ra roughness measurement of 4.8 µm, a direct consequence of the particulate matter and corrosion products embedded within the film.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the complex composition of this layer, identifying strong signals for carbon and oxygen alongside trace elements like sulfur and chlorine—these contaminants, they are typical of environmental exposure and prior service life. One can observe a distinct textural variation across the surface; some regions exhibit a blistered, porous morphology, while adjacent areas display a more consolidated, almost crust-like appearance. This heterogeneity suggests a multi-stage degradation process, where the original passivation layer has been compromised, allowing for the subsequent adhesion of organic and inorganic species that create a visually mottled, dark gray panorama under the microscope.

  Following the laser ablation process, the transformation of the titanium surface is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously dominant contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, metallic substrate beneath—a result that is immediately evident even at lower magnifications. The surface, she now exhibits a markedly different morphology, characterized by a clean, micro-roughened texture that is uniform across the entire analyzed area. The original Ra value of 4.8 µm has been significantly reduced to a consistent 1.2 µm, a direct quantification of the contaminant removal and the subtle textural modification imparted by the laser's controlled interaction with the base metal.

What strikes one is the elegant micro-patterning left behind; the laser treatment has created a fine, congealed structure of resolidified titanium, with features measuring between 5 and 8 µm in width. This recast layer, while minimal, exhibits a beautiful, wavy pattern that speaks to the rapid melt-and-quench cycle induced by the laser pulses. XPS analysis confirms this surface purification, showing a dramatic reduction in carbon content and the restoration of a stable, protective titanium dioxide (TiO₂) layer—approximately 120 to 150 nanometers thick. This newly formed oxide, it is continuous and defect-free, which is critical for the material's corrosion resistance in demanding applications.
