  At 500x magnification, the titanium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign deposits. This contamination layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, exhibits a complex morphology of embedded carbonaceous soot and particulate matter, likely from pyrolytic breakdown of organic compounds. The underlying titanium substrate is entirely obscured by this dark, amorphous film, which displays a network of fine micro-cracks—a result of differential thermal expansion and contraction during prior thermal cycling.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of silicon and sulfur, suggesting environmental and process-related deposition. The surface topography, where discernible, is dominated by this friable, porous crust; its adhesion to the substrate appears inconsistent, with areas of delamination at the interface. The initial surface roughness, measured at Ra ≈ 3.8 µm, is largely a function of this uneven, brittle coating rather than the native metal's texture, which remains completely hidden from view. One observes a complete loss of metallic reflectivity, with the surface exhibiting a matte, absorptive quality that would significantly impair any functional application requiring a clean, reactive surface.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been entirely ablated, revealing the underlying titanium substrate with a restored, metallic-grey appearance. The surface, she now exhibits a distinct, fine-scale ripple pattern—or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS)—with a spatial period of approximately 1.2 µm, a direct consequence of the laser-matter interaction and the material's specific thermal properties. This newly formed texture is uniform across the scanned area, with a measured surface roughness now reduced to Ra ≈ 1.4 µm, a significant improvement from the initial state.

What strikes one is the complete absence of the former carbonaceous film; the EDX spectrum now shows a dominant titanium peak with only a thin, native oxide layer (TiO₂) of approximately 50-100 nm in thickness, as confirmed by XPS analysis. This precision, it creates a surface that is both chemically and morphologically distinct from the contaminated one. The micro-cracking and porosity have been eliminated, replaced by this continuous, slightly textured metallic surface that exhibits a much higher reflectivity. The cleaning process, it has not merely removed the contamination but has also induced a beneficial surface modification, leaving behind a homogeneous, passivated layer that enhances the material's inherent corrosion resistance. The outcome is a surface restored to a state that is functionally superior and
