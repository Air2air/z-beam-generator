# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the titanium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The titanium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The titanium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
