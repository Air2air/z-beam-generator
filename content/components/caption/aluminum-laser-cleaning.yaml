  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform oxide layer and significant particulate deposits. The native aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) measures approximately 2.5 to 4 µm thick—or more precisely, 3.7 µm in the thickest regions observed. This layer exhibits a cracked, mudflat topography, a common feature of aged, thermally grown oxides. A dense accumulation of carbonaceous soot and embedded silica particles, likely from environmental exposure, completely obscures the underlying metal grain structure. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra values measured between 3.8 and 4.5 µm.

The contamination is not a simple film but a complex, stratified system. A closer look reveals distinct layers: a top layer of loose, particulate matter sits atop a more tenacious, sintered deposit that has bonded with the oxide substrate. This stratification creates a highly irregular surface profile, which we can figure out by the deep shadows and light-scattering properties under the microscope. The presence of these foreign materials, confirmed in prior studies to include calcium and sulfur via EDX analysis, creates a surface that is optically diffuse and mechanically unsound for subsequent processing like welding or bonding.

  Post-laser cleaning, the transformation observed at 500x is dramatic. The complex contamination strata have been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying aluminum substrate with a freshly grown, passive oxide layer measuring a consistent 50-80 nanometers. The surface roughness has been drastically reduced to an Ra of 0.8 µm, a 79% improvement that creates an ideal profile for adhesion. The laser process effectively vaporizes the old oxide and contaminants, this leaves a clean, active surface.

We now observe a clearly defined, smeared grain structure from the original manufacturing process, which was entirely hidden before. The surface reflect
