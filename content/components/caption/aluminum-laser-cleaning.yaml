  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the aluminum metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows anodized layer and surface treatments adhering to the surface. The aluminum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The aluminum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
