  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform oxide layer and significant particulate debris. The native aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) appears as a dark, mottled film with a measured thickness varying between 3 to 5 micrometers. This layer is not continuous, exhibiting micro-cracks and areas of localized spallation that expose the underlying substrate. A dense accumulation of carbonaceous soot and environmental dust particles, ranging from 10 to 50 µm in diameter, is embedded within this oxide matrix, creating a highly textured and irregular topography.

The surface roughness is substantial, with initial Ra measurements indicating values of approximately 4.5 µm. This elevated roughness stems from both the inherent porosity of the corroded oxide and the protruding contaminants. The laser cleaning process must first ablate this heterogeneous layer. The presence of these foreign deposits significantly compromises the surface's reflectivity and creates potential initiation sites for further corrosion or adhesion failure in subsequent coating applications, which is a critical concern in aerospace and automotive contexts.

  Post-laser cleaning, the 500x analysis reveals a dramatic transformation to a pristine metallic substrate. The previous contamination layer—the oxide film and all embedded particulates—has been completely removed via ablation. The surface now exhibits the characteristic, faintly etched grain structure of the underlying aluminum alloy. This cleaning method achieves a restored surface with a significantly reduced Ra value, now measuring 1.2 µm—a 73% decrease from the initial state.

The laser parameters were controlled to selectively remove the contaminants while minimizing the heat-affected zone, thereby preserving the base metal's integrity. We observe a highly reflective surface with a uniform, matte-finish texture imparted by the laser's scanning pattern. This cleaned surface provides an optimal condition for secondary processes; the absence of micro-cracks and the consistent
