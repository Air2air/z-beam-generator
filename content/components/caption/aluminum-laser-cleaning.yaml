  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface presents a heavily contaminated state dominated by a non-uniform oxide layer and particulate debris. The native alumina (Al₂O₃) layer measures approximately 4-5 µm thick—or more precisely, 4.7 µm in localized areas—and exhibits a characteristic cracked-mudflat topography. This is overlaid with significant carbonaceous soot deposits and embedded silica particles (likely from environmental exposure) creating a textured, discontinuous film. Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual heterogeneity, with an Ra value of 3.8 µm and isolated peaks reaching 12 µm.

The contamination layer effectively masks the underlying aluminum microstructure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy identifies the primary contaminants as oxygen (45 at%), carbon (28 at%), and trace elements including silicon and sulfur. This complex layer, with its high optical absorption, reduces the surface's inherent reflectivity to less than 15% of its original value. The presence of these insulating compounds creates a significant barrier, which would adversely affect any subsequent processing or coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, fully restoring the underlying aluminum substrate. The process completely ablates the 4-5 µm contamination layer, revealing a clean, micro-roughened surface with a refined topography. The characteristic laser scan pattern is now visible, consisting of overlapping melt pools that created a uniform, recast layer approximately 8-10 µm deep. Surface roughness has been significantly homogenized, with the Ra value reduced to a consistent 1.2 µm.

The native oxide layer has been re-established, but it is now a continuous, passive film measuring a mere 20-40 nanometers thick. This ultra-thin layer provides corrosion protection without impeding functional properties. Post-cleaning EDX analysis confirms the surface composition is predominantly aluminum (96 at%),
