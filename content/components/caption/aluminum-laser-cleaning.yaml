  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous oxide layer measuring between 15 and 25 micrometers in thickness. This layer exhibits a cracked, mud-caked topography with visible blistering and delamination at the interface with the underlying substrate. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contamination consists of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), with significant localized concentrations of carbonaceous deposits and embedded silicate particles—likely from environmental exposure. The surface roughness is highly variable, with Ra measurements ranging from 4.5 to over 8.0 µm in contaminated zones.

We observe a complex stratification. A porous, amorphous outer layer, approximately 10-12 µm thick, sits atop a more compact but fractured inner oxide. This stratified structure creates numerous sub-surface micro-cracks and voids that act as initiation sites for further corrosion. The visual texture is dominated by dark, mottled regions of thick oxide interspersed with lighter areas where the base metal is partially exposed, though still covered by a thin, tenacious film. This heterogeneous condition severely compromises surface integrity for any subsequent coating or bonding operation, as the weak boundary layer provides poor adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing a clean, metallically bright substrate with a distinctly altered micro-topography. The thick, fractured oxide layer is entirely absent, replaced by a nascent, passivating oxide film measuring less than 0.1 µm—or about 100 nanometers—in thickness. Surface roughness is now uniform and significantly reduced, with Ra values consistently measured between 1.2 and 1.8 µm. This creates an ideal profile for adhesion, as the micro-roughness provides increased surface area for mechanical bonding without the weak boundary layer previously observed.

The surface exhibits a finely textured, recast structure with a
