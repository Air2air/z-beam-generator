  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the aluminum Laser cleaning of aluminum utilizes short pulses (ns-range) from fiber lasers at 1064 nm wavelength. The process relies on the rapid thermal expansion of surface contaminants, which have a lower vaporization threshold than the underlying aluminum substrate (melting point ~660°C). This allows for selective removal of oxides, paints, and oils while preserving the base material's integrity and preventing heat-affected zones (HAZ) when parameters are correctly optimized.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The aluminum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The aluminum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
