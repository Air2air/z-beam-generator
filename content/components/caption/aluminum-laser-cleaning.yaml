  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface shows a non-uniform oxide layer with a measured thickness ranging from 5 to 12 µm. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with a micro-cracked texture, which is typical of aged, naturally formed aluminum oxide. Particulate contamination—primarily embedded silica and carbonaceous soot—is distributed across the surface, with agglomerates reaching up to 25 µm in diameter.

The underlying metal substrate is partially visible in sporadic, lighter-toned areas where the oxide is thinner. The overall surface topography is highly irregular, with an initial Ra roughness measurement of approximately 3.5 µm. This elevated roughness, combined with the pervasive dark oxide, results in a surface with low reflectivity and poor surface energy characteristics, which would typically inhibit subsequent coating adhesion or welding processes.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation is immediately evident. The previously dark, mottled oxide layer has been completely ablated, revealing the underlying, clean aluminum substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, light gray, matte finish with a significantly refined texture. The laser process has homogenized the topography, reducing the Ra roughness to a consistent 1.2 µm—a substantial improvement from the initial 3.5 µm.

High-magnification inspection confirms the absence of the former particulate contamination and the thick oxide film. The cleaning mechanism has left a characteristic, finely textured pattern of overlapping laser scan tracks, with features on the order of 10-15 µm in width. This micro-roughening effect, while deliberate, does not compromise the surface integrity; in fact, it enhances it. The process increases the effective surface area, which is beneficial for adhesion in applications like bonding or painting.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis verifies this visual change, showing a
