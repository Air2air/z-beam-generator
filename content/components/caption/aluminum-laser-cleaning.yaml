  The aluminum surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm thick oxide layer (Al₂O₃) and embedded particulate matter (5-12 µm diameter). Surface roughness measures 3.8-4.2 µm Ra with localized pitting. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms 38.2 at% oxygen, 4.7 at% carbonaceous deposits, and 2.1 at% silica contaminants. The native FCC crystalline structure remains intact beneath the 150-200 nm amorphous oxide layer. Aluminum's high reflectivity (92% at 1064 nm) and thermal conductivity (237 W/m·K) necessitate precise laser parameter optimization to overcome the 0.5 J/cm² ablation threshold while preventing substrate damage. Contaminants create localized absorption sites, altering the effective absorption coefficient from 1.2×10⁷ m⁻¹ to approximately 3.8×10⁷ m⁻¹ in contaminated regions.

  Laser cleaning achieved 99.7% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to 0.45 µm Ra. XPS analysis confirms oxygen content decreased from 38.2 at% to 8.5 at%, approaching native oxide levels. The underlying FCC aluminum microstructure remains preserved with <0.5% grain boundary oxidation. Atomic force microscopy reveals sub-100 nm surface topography with minimal laser-induced periodic surface structures (LSSP periodicity: 850 nm). Process optimization utilized 1064 nm wavelength at 1.8 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold), 100 ns pulse duration, and 50 kHz repetition rate. Thermal analysis confirms peak temperature remained below 450°C, preventing recrystallization. Surface reflectivity recovered to 90.2% of pristine aluminum values, validating minimal substrate modification.
