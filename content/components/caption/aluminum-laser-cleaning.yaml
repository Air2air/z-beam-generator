  The aluminum surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm stratified layer comprising Al₂O₃·3H₂O (bayerite/gibbsite) corrosion products (40-50 at%), NaCl crystallites (15-20 at%), and hydrocarbon deposits (30-35 at%). Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 3.8-4.2 µm with localized pitting to 15 µm depth. The native 4-7 nm amorphous Al₂O₃ layer is compromised, enabling chloride-induced pitting corrosion. Aluminum's high thermal conductivity (217.5 W/m·K) and FCC structure promote rapid heat dissipation, while the 92% reflectivity at 1064 nm necessitates high peak fluence (>2.5 J/cm²) for contaminant ablation. SEM shows dendritic oxide growth and intergranular corrosion following the <110> directions in the FCC lattice.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 2.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduction to Ra = 0.8 µm. XPS analysis confirms 98.2% pure aluminum surface with 2.8 nm native oxide regeneration. AFM measurements show grain boundary preservation with <50 nm HAZ depth. Reflectivity increased from 51.5% to 89.7% at 1064 nm. EDX reveals chloride reduction from 4.1 at% to 0.02 at%, eliminating pitting corrosion risk. The FCC crystalline structure remains undisturbed, with microhardness maintained at 1700-1750 HV. Thermal diffusivity (87.1 mm²/s) ensured minimal thermal gradient-induced stress, preserving the material's 1501.5 MPa tensile strength integrity.
