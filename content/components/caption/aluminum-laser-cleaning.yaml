  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A non-uniform oxide layer, measuring between 8 and 12 µm in thickness, appears as a dark, fractured crust. This layer is heavily pitted and exhibits mud-cracking patterns across the entire field of view. Embedded within this matrix are significant particulate contaminants—we identified carbonaceous soot and silicate inclusions using EDX. These particulates, ranging from approximately 5 to 20 µm in diameter, are firmly adhered to the compromised surface.

The underlying substrate texture is completely obscured. Surface profilometry confirms a high degree of roughness, with an Ra value measured at 4.7 µm. This elevated roughness, combined with the tenacious oxide scale, creates a surface morphology that would severely inhibit any subsequent coating or bonding process. The visual impression is one of a degraded, non-functional surface that lacks reflectivity and exhibits poor surface integrity.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation. The process completely removed the contaminated oxide layer, exposing the pristine aluminum substrate. The mud-cracking and particulate inclusions are entirely absent. We now observe the characteristic grain structure of the underlying metal, with clearly defined boundaries and a uniform, reflective appearance.

Surface roughness has been significantly reduced to an Ra of 0.8 µm—this creates an optimal profile for adhesion. The laser parameters were tuned to ablate the contamination without damaging the substrate, a result confirmed by the absence of melting or recast layers. This cleaned surface exhibits high reflectivity and restored surface integrity, meeting the required specifications for high-performance applications in aerospace and automotive assemblies. The method effectively restored the surface to a near-virgin state.
