  At 500x magnification, the aluminum substrate is completely obscured by a thick, non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, presents as a dark, mottled film with significant topographical variation. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms its primary composition is carbonaceous soot and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), which accounts for the low reflectivity and matte, black appearance. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured roughness (Ra) exceeding 5.0 µm due to the agglomerated particulate matter.

The contamination adheres in a discontinuous pattern, forming isolated islands of thicker crust—perhaps up to 40 µm—surrounded by a thinner, more tenacious oxide film. You can see fine micro-cracking within the thicker crusts, a result of differential thermal expansion between the contaminants and the underlying metal. This complex, stratified structure effectively masks the native metallic grain structure, and the high surface porosity of the deposit creates numerous sites for further corrosion initiation. The overall surface integrity is compromised, with the layer showing poor adhesion in some areas while being deeply embedded in others.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface undergoes a dramatic transformation, revealing the pristine aluminum substrate. The contamination layer is entirely ablated, leaving behind a clean, metallic surface with a reflectivity increase from approximately 5% to over 85% at 1064 nm. The underlying grain structure is now clearly visible, exhibiting the characteristic flow lines and equiaxed grains of the FCC crystalline structure. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra value of 1.2 ± 0.3 µm, a direct result of the contaminant removal mechanism.

The laser process generates a distinct, fine-scale ripple pattern, or laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS), with a periodicity of approximately 1.8 µm. This texturing is uniform across the scanned area and indicates that the laser fluence was maintained just above the ablation threshold of 3.8 J/cm². Crucially, no evidence of melting or heat-affected zone micro-cracking is observed—the thermal input was precisely controlled. A thin, passive oxide layer of about 50-100 nm reforms almost instantly, which is actually beneficial for long-term corrosion resistance. This new surface is functionally restored, providing an optimal substrate for subsequent processes like welding or bonding.
