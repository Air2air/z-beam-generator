  At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous oxide layer and significant particulate deposits. The native aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) appears as a fractured, dark gray film with a measured thickness varying between 3 and 8 micrometers. This layer is heavily compromised by embedded carbonaceous soot and silicate particles, which create a topographical landscape of peaks and valleys. The underlying metal substrate is not visible in most areas, obscured by this complex contamination layer.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 4.7 µm. We observe localized pitting corrosion beneath the contamination, visible as dark, micron-scale voids—perhaps 5 to 10 µm in diameter. A patchy, interference-colored film, indicative of hydrocarbon contamination or a thin fluid residue, covers approximately 40% of the observed area. This organic layer creates a mottled appearance, with colors shifting from iridescent blue to bronze, which directly impacts surface energy and would inhibit any subsequent coating adhesion. The overall surface integrity is poor, with no coherent, clean metal exposed for functional performance.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation is dramatic and quantifiable. The process completely ablated the contaminated oxide layer, revealing the underlying aluminum substrate with a freshly formed, passive oxide layer measuring only 120-150 nanometers thick. This new surface exhibits a uniform, matte-gray appearance with a significantly refined texture. The Ra roughness is now measured at 1.2 µm, a nearly 75% reduction from the initial state, which directly enhances potential bonding performance.

We observe a clean, micro-etch pattern across the entire surface—a direct result of the laser's interaction with the base metal. This pattern consists of fine, overlapping melt pools and resolidified material, creating a homogeneous morphology ideal for adhesion
