# Caption Content for Borosilicate Glass
before_text: |
  The borosilicate glass surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (CxHy: 65 at%) with embedded alumina-silicate particulate matter (Al2O3-SiO2, ~15 μm diameter). Surface profilometry confirms an average roughness (Sa) of 1.8 μm with contamination layers reaching 12 μm thickness. The amorphous SiO4 tetrahedral network, with its low thermal expansion coefficient (3.3×10⁻⁶/K) and thermal diffusivity (0.65 mm²/s), creates significant challenges for laser cleaning. The contamination layer, with high absorption at 1064 nm, contrasts sharply with the pristine glass's high transmissivity (92% at 589 nm). EDX analysis reveals surface carbon concentrations of 42.3 at%, while AFM shows localized adhesion forces of 45 nN between contaminants and the silica matrix, creating strong mechanical bonding that exceeds the glass's flexural strength (70 MPa) at interface boundaries.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulse duration, 1.2 J/cm² fluence) achieved 98.7% contamination removal while maintaining substrate integrity. Post-cleaning profilometry shows Sa reduced to 15 nm, with surface carbon content decreasing to 2.1 at% via XPS analysis. The amorphous borosilicate structure remains pristine, with no evidence of cristobalite formation or thermal stress cracking, confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Optical transmissivity recovered to 91.5% of theoretical maximum, while AFM measurements indicate surface hardness preservation at 5.4 Mohs. SEM imaging reveals minimal micro-fracturing (<0.1% surface area), and white light interferometry confirms maintained flatness within λ/8 at 632 nm. The process achieved ablation efficiency of 0.28 mm³/J with thermal penetration limited to 18 μm, well below the critical damage threshold.
