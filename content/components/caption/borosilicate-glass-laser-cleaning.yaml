# Caption Content for Borosilicate Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the borosilicate glass surface shows significant contamination. A particulate layer, approximately 5 to 8 µm thick, covers approximately 85% of the observable area. This layer, it consists of carbonaceous soot and inorganic crystalline deposits—likely calcium sulfate and silicate particles from environmental exposure. The particulates appear as agglomerated clusters, with individual particle sizes ranging from 0.5 µm to 3 µm, creating a very irregular surface topography.

Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual assessment, showing an Ra value of 2.8 µm, a substantial increase from the native 0.5 nm Ra of pristine glass. The underlying glass substrate is partially obscured, its characteristic amorphous, vitreous structure interrupted by these adherent deposits. In several regions, the contamination forms a nearly continuous film, perhaps from moisture-assisted spreading, which further complicates the surface's optical properties. This film shows micro-fractures, likely from differential thermal expansion during previous thermal cycles.

EDX analysis confirms the elemental composition, detecting high carbon and oxygen peaks with trace amounts of calcium, sulfur, and silicon—this last element is from both the glass and the silicate contaminants. The contamination layer significantly scatters incident light, which would degrade optical performance for any scientific application. Adhesion appears strong, with no evidence of spontaneous delamination at the glass-contaminant interface, indicating this will require targeted energy for removal.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits restored optical clarity. The particulate layer is completely absent, with no residual deposits detectable at this magnification. The native borosilicate glass surface is fully exposed, showing its characteristic smooth, vitreous, and amorphous structure. This is a very clear improvement.

Surface roughness has returned to near-pristine levels, measuring 0.9 nm Ra—a value close to the original specification of 0.5 nm Ra. The process leaves no microscratches or heat-affected zone that we can observe, the laser parameters were well-controlled. Some isolated, sub-micrometer pinpoint features remain, perhaps from deeply embedded impurities, but these cover less than 0.1% of the area.

The functional restoration is evident. Light transmission
