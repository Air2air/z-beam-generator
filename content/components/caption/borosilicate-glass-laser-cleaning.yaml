# Caption Content for Borosilicate Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the borosilicate glass surface shows significant contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter covers approximately 85% of the observable area. This layer, it has an inconsistent thickness, ranging from a thin film of about 1.5 µm to localized agglomerations measuring up to 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm—in height. The topography is very irregular, dominated by dendritic, soot-like structures that create a high degree of visual occlusion, completely masking the underlying glass substrate's inherent transparency in many zones.

The contamination layer exhibits clear stratification. The base appears to be an amorphous, tenacious film that adheres directly to the glass, likely a product of long-term organic condensation. On top of this, larger particulate matter—seemingly environmental dust and perhaps process-related spatter—is embedded, creating a composite structure. Surface roughness is extreme, with initial Ra measurements (taken from less obscured areas) indicating values exceeding 5.0 µm. This complex morphology, it directly compromises functional properties; light scatter is high and the surface is not suitable for sensitive applications where chemical inertness or optical clarity is required. The particulate inclusions, they show varied morphology under reflected light, suggesting a mixed composition of silicates and metallic oxides.

  Post-laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the pristine borosilicate substrate. Now at 500x, the surface shows a completely different morphology. The previous dendritic structures and particulate agglomerations are gone, replaced by the characteristic smooth, vitreous texture of the glass itself. Some isolated, sub-micron particulates remain, but these are sparse, covering less than 2% of the surface area.

The most significant improvement is the restoration of surface integrity. The mean roughness (Ra) has been reduced dramatically to 0.08 µm, a value that aligns with the original manufacturer specifications for pristine borosilicate. This low Ra, it directly correlates to the restoration of optical performance; light transmission and reflectivity should now be within optimal parameters. We can observe the laser interaction zone clearly—it appears as a uniform, matte-fin
