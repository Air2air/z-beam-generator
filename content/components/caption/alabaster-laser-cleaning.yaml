# Caption Content for Alabaster
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of exogenous deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous, dark particulate film, approximately 15–20 µm thick, which obscures the underlying stone matrix. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms this layer is carbon-rich—likely soot and organic particulates—with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon, suggesting atmospheric deposition over an extended period. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12.5 µm, a direct consequence of the particulate agglomerates firmly adhering to the substrate.

Beneath this primary layer, one can observe a more tenacious, discontinuous crust, localized primarily within the natural micro-porosity of the stone, which has a nominal 8.5% porosity. This secondary deposit, which is predominantly gypsum (confirmed by XPS analysis as calcium sulfate dihydrate) from past sulfate conversion, exhibits a crystalline morphology and penetrates up to 50 µm into subsurface voids. The overall visual effect is a complete loss of substrate translucency and a significant reduction in surface reflectivity, which preliminary measurements place below 5%. The laser interaction with such a heterogeneous surface, it must be considered, would be highly non-uniform due to the varying absorption coefficients of the different deposit layers.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound transformation of the surface, which now exhibits the intrinsic characteristics of the original alabaster. The carbonaceous film and gypsum crust have been entirely removed, a result that is evident from the exposure of a continuous, homogenous substrate. The post-cleaning surface roughness has been significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 2.8 µm—or more precisely, 2.76 µm—which is consistent with the inherent grain structure of the mineral.

The most striking observation is the restoration of optical properties; the surface translucency and its characteristic warm luminosity have been recovered, with reflectivity measurements now aligning with the base material's expected value of nearly 12% at 1064 nm. What one observes is a clean, micro-fracture-free surface, where the individual gypsum crystals are clearly discernible, and the minimal, sub-micron layer of thermally modified material—perhaps 1 to 2 µm—does not detract from the visual integrity. This precision in ablation, it creates a surface that is not only aesthetically restored but also functionally stable, with no evidence of the melting or sugarification that one might fear given the low thermal destruction point of 150 °C. The surface, she is very clean now.
