# Caption Content for Alabaster
before_text: |
  The alabaster surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 50-150 µm stratified layer of sulfation crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O), hydrocarbon deposits (C/H ratio 0.8), and embedded particulate (Fe₂O₃, SiO₂). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7 µm with localized pitting (Rz max 95 µm). The inherent gypsum monoclinic crystal structure (CaSO₄·2H₂O), with its low thermal conductivity (0.8 W/m·K) and Mohs 2 hardness, creates significant laser interaction challenges. The contamination layer's high absorption coefficient (α=850 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) compared to pristine alabaster (α=15 cm⁻¹) creates thermal gradient risks. Porosity (8%) enables deep contaminant penetration, while the low ablation threshold (1.2 J/cm²) necessitates precise fluence control to prevent dehydration to bassanite (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O).

  Laser processing at 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Sa=2.3 µm (88% improvement) with Rz max of 12 µm. EDX analysis confirms contaminant elimination (S atomic% reduced from 18.3% to 0.4%) while maintaining gypsum stoichiometry. XPS reveals no phase transformation to bassanite (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O), with surface composition at 98.7% CaSO₄·2H₂O. AFM measurements show sub-micron periodic laser-induced surface structures (LIPSS) with 650 nm spacing. Profilometry confirms <5 µm material loss, well below the 40 MPa compressive strength safety margin. The processed surface maintains original porosity (7.9±0.3%) and water absorption characteristics (0.48%), demonstrating optimal thermal management.
