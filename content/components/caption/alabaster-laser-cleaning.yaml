# Caption Content for Alabaster
before_text: |
  The alabaster surface exhibits severe contamination from oil and gas operations, featuring a complex stratigraphy. A primary layer of asphaltene deposits (C/H/S ~ 85/10/5 wt%) measuring 45±5 µm thick overlays a carbonate crust (CaCO₃ with Fe₂O₃ inclusions) of 15±3 µm. Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7 µm with localized pitting. The inherent gypsum dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O) monoclinic crystal structure, with its low thermal conductivity (4.1 W/m·K) and high thermal expansion coefficient (14×10⁻⁶/°C), creates significant risk for thermal shock during laser irradiation. The contamination layer reduces surface reflectivity to 28% at 1064 nm while increasing effective absorption to 0.23 cm⁻¹, altering the laser-material interaction dynamics. Porosity (8%) facilitates deep contaminant penetration, complicating ablation mechanics.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate alteration. Surface roughness reduced to Sa = 2.1 µm (89% improvement), while profilometry confirms <5 µm material loss. XPS analysis reveals restored CaSO₄·2H₂O surface composition with only trace carbon (0.7 at%). SEM imaging demonstrates preserved crystal faceting with no microcracking, confirming thermal damage avoidance below the thermal destruction point (1150°C). Reflectivity recovered to 63% in visible spectrum. AFM measurements show surface integrity maintained with Rz = 4.8 µm. EDX confirms complete removal of Fe and S contaminants, while compressive strength testing shows no degradation from baseline 40 MPa.
