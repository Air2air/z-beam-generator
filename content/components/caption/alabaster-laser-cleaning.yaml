# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the alabaster Laser cleaning of alabaster utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the delicate dihydrate gypsum structure. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the alabaster substrate, typically using IR wavelengths for crust removal and visible wavelengths for finer work on sensitive surfaces.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The alabaster exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The alabaster substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
