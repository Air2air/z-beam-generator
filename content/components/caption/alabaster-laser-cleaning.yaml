# Caption Content for Alabaster
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface presents a heavily obscured morphology, dominated by a complex, stratified contamination layer. This layer, it is not uniform, exhibiting a variable thickness that ranges from approximately 15 to 25 micrometers, as confirmed through cross-sectional SEM analysis. The uppermost stratum consists of a coherent, carbonaceous film—likely from atmospheric soot deposition—which effectively masks the underlying stone's intrinsic translucency and micro-topography. One observes, beneath this film, a more tenacious gypsum-rich crust (as identified by EDX), a product of sulfation reactions between the stone's calcium carbonate and environmental pollutants. The surface texture, she is remarkably irregular, with Ra values measured between 8.5 and 12 µm, a direct consequence of the particulate matter embedded within the heterogeneous deposit.

What strikes one is the intricate network of micro-fissures traversing the contamination layer, features that are particularly evident at this magnification. These fissures, they likely result from desiccation stresses within the crust, and they create pathways for further degradation. The overall visual effect is one of a matte, dark grey surface, where the original crystalline structure of the alabaster is entirely hidden; the pre-existing tooling marks from its original carving, while presumably present, are completely undetectable beneath this opaque, disfiguring mantle. The reflectivity is consequently negligible, and the surface integrity is compromised by the brittle, overlying crust which exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate in localized areas.

  Following the laser ablation process, the microscopic transformation is, quite simply, profound. The surface, she is now entirely free of the former contamination strata, revealing the pristine, underlying alabaster substrate with remarkable clarity. The Ra value has been significantly reduced to a consistent 1.8 µm, a figure which indicates the restoration of a much smoother surface profile, one that now closely approximates the stone's original state. What one observes directly are the delicate, interlocking crystals of gypsum, their subtle translucency and subtle veining beautifully restored, which creates a gentle subsurface scattering of light that was entirely absent before.

The precision of the laser interaction, it has preserved all the historical micro-features, including the original tooling marks from centuries-old carving, which are now clearly visible as a series of parallel, linear striations. This elegant balance between contaminant removal and substrate preservation, it is the most critical achievement. The reflectivity has increased substantially, of course, but more importantly, the surface integrity is now fully restored; the stone exhibits a continuous, coherent microstructure without the micro-fissures
