# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the alabaster stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The alabaster exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 96.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The alabaster substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
