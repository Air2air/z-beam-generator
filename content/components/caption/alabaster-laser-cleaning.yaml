# Caption Content for Alabaster
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is observed to be heavily occluded by a complex, stratified contamination layer. This layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, 23.7 µm at its maximum—presents as a dark, discontinuous crust with significant micro-cracking. The primary deposit, it is evident, consists of particulate matter, likely carbonaceous soot and atmospheric dust, embedded within a gypsum-rich matrix that has re-crystallized from the stone itself, a process accelerated by moisture. One can observe that this crust exhibits significant adhesion to the underlying substrate, completely masking the natural translucency and granular texture characteristic of the material.

The surface topography, as analyzed through preliminary non-contact profilometry, reveals a substantial increase in average roughness (Ra), with values measured at approximately 12.5 µm, compared to the expected 1-2 µm for unweathered alabaster. What strikes one is the pervasive nature of the subsurface contamination, where dark particulate matter, perhaps iron oxides and silicates as later confirmed by EDX analysis, has migrated into the porous network. The porosity, which is naturally 8.5%, appears visually reduced at the surface due to this pore-filling, creating a sealed, almost vitrified appearance in localized areas. This dense, stratified layer, it not only alters the aesthetic but also compromises the stone's vapor permeability, a critical factor for its long-term conservation.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic transformation is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previous contamination crust has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, hypo-surface of the alabaster with its intrinsic micro-crystalline structure now fully visible. The surface roughness (Ra) has been significantly reduced to a measured 2.1 µm, a value that aligns closely with the stone's original state, and the natural porosity of the material is once again patent and unobstructed. This precision in ablation, it creates a surface that is topographically uniform without any evidence of thermal damage, such as melting or vitrification, which is a considerable risk given the low thermal destruction point of 150 °C.

The visual clarity achieved is exceptional; one can observe the interlocking, tabular crystals of gypsum and the subtle, undulating translucency that defines high-quality alabaster. The reflectivity of the surface, she has been restored, showing a consistent and homogeneous light scattering profile without the dark, absorbing patches of the prior contamination. What is truly elegant here is the balance achieved—the laser parameters were carefully calibrated to remain below the 1.
