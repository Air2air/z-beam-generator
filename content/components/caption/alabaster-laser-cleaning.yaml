# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the alabaster stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The alabaster exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The alabaster substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
