  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy particulate contamination. A dark, discontinuous soot layer, approximately 12–15 µm thick, is clearly visible, it obscures the underlying plaster substrate. This layer appears amorphous and exhibits significant micro-cracking, with crack widths measuring between 2 and 5 µm. The soot deposits are not uniform, they form agglomerates that create a very rough topography.

Further analysis reveals a secondary contaminant. A crystalline deposit, perhaps from salt efflorescence or a mineral film, forms isolated patches up to 200 µm in diameter. These crystals show a cubic morphology, which is characteristic of sodium chloride. The original plaster surface texture is completely masked, its inherent micro-porosity filled with fine particulate matter. Surface roughness (Ra) is high, preliminary stylus profilometry indicates values exceeding 8.0 µm. This contamination layer, it severely compromises the substrate's reflectivity and would likely hinder any coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The thick soot layer is completely absent, this reveals the original plaster substrate with its natural micro-porosity. Surface roughness (Ra) now measures 2.1 µm, a reduction of nearly 75% from the contaminated state. This is a significant improvement for surface integrity. The plaster's crystalline matrix is now fully exposed, showing a network of interlocking gypsum crystals with a grain size of 10–40 µm.

Some minor residues persist, however. In isolated micro-depressions, we can see traces of the former crystalline contaminant, now reduced to sub-micron fragments. The cleaning process, it has not induced macroscopic damage; no melting or vitrification of the gypsum is observed at this magnification. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially—this is directly observable as a much brighter field of view under identical illumination. The functional restoration is evident, the surface is now suitable for further conservation treatments or coating applications, its original texture and composition effectively restored. This level of precision, it is very important for cultural heritage applications where material preservation is critical.
