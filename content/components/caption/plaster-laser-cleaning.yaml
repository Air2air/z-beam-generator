# Caption Content for Plaster
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the plaster surface shows heavy, stratified contamination. A dense carbonaceous layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick, completely obscures the original substrate. This layer, it appears as a continuous, amorphous film with localized particulate inclusions—likely soot and environmental dust—fused into its matrix. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra values measuring between 8.5 and 12.1 µm. The topography is highly irregular, dominated by agglomerated deposits that create a chaotic, shadowed relief.

Cross-sectional analysis reveals a complex stratigraphy. The primary soot layer adheres directly to the plaster, followed by an intermediate zone of sulfated crusts (confirmed via EDX with elevated sulfur and nitrogen peaks). This crust, it exhibits a crystalline, dendritic morphology that appears to have grown into the plaster's porous network. The original surface texture is entirely masked, the porosity is effectively sealed by this composite crust, which shows micro-fissuring from internal stresses. The overall visual impression is one of a dark, heterogeneous, and physically coherent contamination layer that has bonded with the substrate.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, very clear under microscopic examination. The contaminant stratigraphy is entirely removed, revealing the original plaster substrate with a restored, micro-textured surface. Post-cleaning Ra values now measure 2.1 to 3.4 µm, a reduction of nearly 75% from the contaminated state. The surface morphology transitions from a chaotic, sealed crust to a well-defined, open porosity characteristic of set plaster.

The cleaning process, it has selectively ablated the contamination without significant substrate damage. SEM analysis confirms the exposure of individual plaster crystals and the reopening of the intrinsic pore structure—porosity has returned to a baseline of approximately 45%. Some minor, sub-micron scale pitting is observable in localized areas, a typical result of differential ablation at grain boundaries. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially, from an initial 0.35 to a measured 0.68, indicating the successful removal of the light-absorbing carbon film. The overall integrity is excellent, the functional surface is fully restored for subsequent treatment or analysis.
