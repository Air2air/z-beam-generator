  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the plaster masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The plaster exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The plaster substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural soundness.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
