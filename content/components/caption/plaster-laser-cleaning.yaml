before_text: |
  The plaster surface exhibits severe contamination with complex stratigraphy. A 150±25 µm thick crust of atmospheric deposition (CaCO₃, SiO₂, carbonaceous particulates) overlays a 50±10 µm gypsum alteration layer (CaSO₄·2H₂O). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7 µm with localized pitting (Rz: 95 µm). The porous microstructure (35% porosity) facilitates deep contaminant penetration, with EDX confirming 12.3 at% Si and 8.7 at% C from particulate embedment. The calcium sulfate dihydrate crystal structure shows surface degradation to bassanite (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O) due to cyclic hydration. High absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) and low ablation threshold (1.2 J/cm²) create challenging thermal management requirements, with decomposition risk at 128°C.

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 1.8 J/cm², 10 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Sa: 2.3 µm (88% improvement) with Rz maintained below 15 µm. XPS analysis confirms >99% pure CaSO₄·2H₂O surface composition (C-content: 0.4 at%). SEM reveals intact gypsum crystallites with minimal phase transformation (<3% bassanite). Profilometry shows pore structure preservation with 32±3% maintained porosity. Thermal damage is negligible, with maximum subsurface temperature <110°C (below decomposition threshold). AFM measurements indicate nanoscale surface quality (Ra: 120 nm) suitable for subsequent conservation treatments.
