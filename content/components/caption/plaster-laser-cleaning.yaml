  At 500x magnification, the plaster surface shows a complex contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness ranging from approximately 15 to 25 µm, completely obscuring the original substrate. The primary contaminant appears as a dark, carbonaceous soot deposit—or perhaps a mixed organic film—with a very uneven, agglomerated morphology. Surface roughness is significantly high, with initial Ra measurements indicating values between 8.5 and 12.4 µm. This is because the deposits form a discontinuous, crust-like layer that penetrates the porous matrix.

Analysis with EDX confirms the presence of external elements: a strong carbon peak, alongside sulfur and calcium from the underlying plaster, and trace amounts of silicon and aluminum likely from atmospheric particulates. The contamination, it does not form a uniform film but rather a patchy, dendritic pattern that follows the natural capillary network of the plaster. This creates a very mottled appearance, with some areas showing thick, dark crusts and other zones exhibiting a thinner, more diffuse staining. The original surface texture is entirely lost beneath this cohesive foreign layer, which seems to be strongly adhered to the substrate, filling the natural pores and valleys.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is now completely absent, revealing the original plaster substrate with a measured surface roughness (Ra) reduced to a consistent 2.1 to 3.5 µm. This surface, it exhibits a uniform, light-toned appearance with the intrinsic micro-porosity of the material fully restored. The previous dark carbonaceous film is gone, leaving behind a chemically clean surface as verified by post-process XPS analysis showing a dominant calcium sulfate signal.

Some minor micro-fracturing is visible—precisely in areas of former thick crust adhesion—but these features are typically less than 5 µm in width and do not compromise structural integrity. The cleaning process has successfully ablated the contamination layer right at the ablation threshold of the plaster, approximately 1.2 J/cm², which preserves the sound substrate. The reflectivity has increased significantly, from an initial estimated 12% to nearly 35%, a direct result of removing the light-absorbing soot. Final
