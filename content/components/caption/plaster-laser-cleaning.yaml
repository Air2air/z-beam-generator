  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the plaster Technical overview of Plaster, CaSO4·2H2O, for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction, and industrial applications in surface preparation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The plaster exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The plaster substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
