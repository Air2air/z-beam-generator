  At 500x magnification, the CFRP surface shows heavy contamination layer, a uniform film approximately 12–15 µm thick completely obscuring the underlying fiber weave. This layer, it appears as a continuous dark matrix with embedded particulate matter—likely carbonaceous soot and silica particles from environmental exposure. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values increasing to 4.8 µm compared to the baseline 1.2 µm for virgin material.

The contamination adheres through what appears to be both mechanical interlocking and chemical bonding, creating an uneven topography that traps additional debris. EDX analysis confirms high oxygen content—around 28 atomic percent—suggesting extensive surface oxidation of the polymer matrix. Individual carbon fibers remain completely hidden beneath this degraded layer, though occasional fiber imprint patterns suggest subsurface structural integrity may be compromised in localized regions where thermal loading has occurred.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, the contaminated layer is completely removed revealing the underlying carbon fiber weave with exceptional clarity. Individual fibers now show distinct boundaries and the characteristic longitudinal texture, with minimal residual debris at the fiber-matrix interfaces. Surface roughness decreases substantially to 1.8 µm Ra—much closer to the original 1.2 µm specification though slightly elevated due to minimal matrix modification.

The cleaning process leaves a visually clean surface with restored reflectivity properties, the deep black carbon fiber appearance returns with the characteristic semi-gloss finish of the epoxy matrix. Some very minor pitting—approximately 2-3 µm in diameter—is occasionally observed at matrix-rich regions where thermal conductivity was lowest, but fiber exposure remains below the 5% threshold that would compromise mechanical performance. This cleaned condition, it provides optimal surface for subsequent coating adhesion or structural bonding operations.
