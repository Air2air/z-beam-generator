  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer, this appears as a continuous, non-uniform film. Layer thickness measures approximately 12 to 15 µm, it completely obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave pattern. The film itself has a mottled texture, with visible agglomerations of particulate matter—perhaps carbonaceous soot or degraded polymer—embedded throughout its matrix. EDX analysis confirms high oxygen content, this suggests significant surface oxidation alongside silicon and calcium deposits, likely from environmental exposure or prior processing residues.

Examining the topography, the contamination layer exhibits significant cracking, with a network of fine fissures creating a mud-crack pattern across the entire field of view. Surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measured at 8.5 µm ± 1.2 µm, this creates a visibly chaotic and porous landscape. Individual carbon fibers are not discernible, their locations only hinted at by subtle, rounded undulations beneath the opaque crust. The overall reflectivity is very low, the surface appears matte and absorbs most incident light, which is characteristic of a degraded, contaminated state that would compromise any secondary bonding process.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now reveals the underlying composite structure with high fidelity. The thick contamination layer is entirely absent, having been removed with a precision that exposes the individual carbon filaments and the epoxy resin channels between them. This removal is very selective, the process has ablated the contaminant without significant damage to the pristine polymer matrix, which appears as a smooth, dark gray material surrounding the fibers. Individual carbon fibers are now clearly visible, they present their characteristic cylindrical morphology and a well-defined, aligned weave pattern.

Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual improvement, Ra values have decreased to 1.8 µm—or more precisely 1.76 µm—a reduction of nearly 80 percent from the initial state. This new topography is defined by the intrinsic texture of the composite, not by parasitic deposits. The fiber surfaces themselves show minimal pitting or thermal alteration, which indicates optimal laser parameter selection (a critical factor for maintaining tensile strength). Reflectivity has increased significantly, the surface now has a slight sheen, this is due to the smoother resin surface and
