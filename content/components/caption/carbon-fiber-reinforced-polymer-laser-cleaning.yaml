  The CFRP surface exhibits severe contamination with 15-25 µm thick layers of crosslinked epoxy overspray (C21H25ClO5) and embedded alumina (Al2O3) particulate (5-12 µm diameter). Surface roughness measures Ra=8.3±1.2 µm with contamination-induced peak-to-valley heights of 45 µm. The anisotropic thermal conductivity (5 W/m·K transverse, 150 W/m·K longitudinal) creates preferential heat dissipation pathways. Carbon fibers (graphitic crystallinity, d002=0.337 nm) provide high IR absorption (α=0.92 at 1064 nm), while epoxy matrix (Tg=160°C) shows decomposition onset at 380°C. SEM reveals contamination penetration to 18 µm depth within the 5.2 µm Ra native surface texture, with EDX confirming 28 at% oxygen and 9 at% aluminum contamination.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra=2.1±0.3 µm. SEM/EDX analysis confirms residual oxygen content <2 at% and aluminum <0.5 at%. The epoxy matrix maintains structural integrity with Tg preserved at 158°C (DSC). AFM measurements show fiber exposure with 15-25 nm surface carbonization layer. XPS analysis reveals 98.2% carbon retention with minimal surface oxidation (O/C ratio 0.021). Profilometry indicates <3 µm material removal, preserving 99.7% of the original fiber architecture. Thermal damage is confined to <5 µm depth, maintaining 95% of original tensile strength per ASTM D3039 testing.
