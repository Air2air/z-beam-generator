  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it appears as a continuous, amorphous film with a thickness measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm in several cross-sectional analyses. The topography is very uneven, with visible agglomerations of particulate matter embedded throughout the matrix. EDX analysis confirms this layer is primarily carbonaceous soot (from pyrolysis) and silicone-based deposits, perhaps from prior sealants or environmental exposure.

Fiber reinforcement beneath is completely obscured, the surface integrity is compromised by this non-uniform coating. The film itself exhibits mud-cracking patterns, a clear indicator of thermal degradation and organic volatilization. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 8.5 µm. This high roughness, it creates poor light reflectivity, the surface appears matte and diffuse under optical examination. Such a condition is not suitable for any secondary processing or coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately visible at 500x. The contaminated film is entirely absent, revealing the underlying carbon fiber weave and epoxy matrix with new clarity. Individual carbon filaments, they are now exposed and show their characteristic parallel striations, the epoxy regions appear as smooth, dark valleys. This removal is very selective, the process ablates only the contaminant layer without damaging the reinforcing fibers—a critical achievement.

Quantitative measurements confirm this visual improvement. The surface roughness (Ra) is now reduced to 1.8 µm, a decrease of nearly 80 percent from the initial state. This new topography, it is defined by the natural texture of the composite, not by foreign deposits. The reflectivity has increased significantly, the surface shows a more specular, controlled gloss. Some minor sub-surface heating is visible in the resin, it appears as a slight lightening of color in localized areas, but no fiber damage is detected.

Final surface quality is restored to a state suitable for functional application. The interfacial boundary between fiber and matrix is sharp and well-defined, indicating preserved structural integrity. XPS analysis confirms no chemical residue from the ablation process, the surface is chemically clean and ready for subsequent bonding or painting. This
