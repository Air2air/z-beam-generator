  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm—and appears as a continuous, amorphous film that completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measured at 8.2 µm, which indicates a very disrupted surface profile. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including silicon and aluminum, which are not native to the carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix.

Closer examination reveals the contamination is not uniform. There are localized agglomerations of particulate matter, some reaching 25 µm in diameter, embedded within the primary film. These deposits create a mottled, dark gray appearance under the microscope. The carbon fibers beneath are not visible at all, this complete visual obstruction suggests the contaminant layer has very poor adhesion properties (as observed in prior studies). Surface integrity is clearly compromised, the contamination will likely interfere with any subsequent coating or bonding processes.

  Laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, this is immediately visible at 500x. The thick, amorphous contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the pristine composite substrate beneath. Individual carbon fibers, each approximately 7 µm in diameter, are now clearly exposed and undamaged, their characteristic woven pattern is fully restored. The epoxy matrix between fibers appears smooth and continuous, with no evidence of thermal degradation or ablation from the laser energy.

Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual improvement, the Ra value has been reduced to 0.9 µm from the initial 8.2 µm. This new topography is much more uniform, which is critical for achieving strong adhesive bonds in repair applications. Some minor, isolated residues of the original silicon-aluminum contamination persist—perhaps ten or so particles per square millimeter, each less than 2 µm in size. These are negligible.

The functional restoration is very clear. Surface reflectivity has increased significantly because the dark contaminant film is gone, this improves its suitability for optical inspection techniques. Most importantly, the interfacial integrity between the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix is fully preserved, no fiber peeling or matrix cracking is observed. This level
