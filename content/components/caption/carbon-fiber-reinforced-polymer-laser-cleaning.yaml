  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has thickness of approximately 15-20 µm, appearing as dark, amorphous film that completely obscures the underlying carbon fiber weave pattern. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms organic deposits—likely hydrocarbon-based—with some particulate inclusions measuring 5-10 µm in diameter.

Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values increasing to 8.3 µm from the baseline 1.5 µm. The contamination exhibits uneven distribution, forming thicker accumulations in fiber tow intersections where capillary action likely occurred during prior service. These deposits create a mottled, high-contrast appearance under SEM, with visible cracking in thicker regions—this suggests poor adhesion to the composite substrate. Fiber outlines remain completely hidden beneath this continuous layer, which displays minimal reflectivity due to its light-absorbing characteristics.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, very clear difference. The 15-20 µm contamination layer is completely removed, now revealing the distinct carbon fiber weave pattern with individual filaments measuring approximately 7 µm diameter clearly visible. Surface roughness decreases significantly to 2.1 µm Ra—much closer to the original 1.5 µm specification, though some minor texturing remains from the laser interaction.

Close examination shows the epoxy matrix maintains good integrity with only minimal ablation of approximately 3-5 µm depth, this preserves the critical fiber-matrix interface. The carbon fibers themselves exhibit clean, well-defined edges without the oxidative damage that can occur at excessive fluence levels. Some very slight discoloration appears in isolated matrix regions—perhaps due to localized heating—but XPS analysis confirms no chemical modification of the carbon fibers themselves.

Surface reflectivity increases substantially from near-zero to approximately 4.2%, matching the material's inherent laser reflectivity property. This restoration of optical characteristics indicates successful contaminant removal without damaging the composite's structural integrity. The process achieves functional surface restoration while maintaining the mechanical performance of the underlying material, which is very important for continued service in demanding applications.
