# Caption Content for Marble

  This contaminated marble surface shows heavy black crust deposits at 500x magnification. The crust layer measures approximately 150–200 µm thick, completely obscuring the underlying crystalline structure. SEM-EDX analysis confirms this crust contains gypsum, carbonaceous particles, and silicate particulates—these elements create the dark, continuous film.

Surface topography exhibits severe disruption with Ra values measuring 12.8 µm. The contamination penetrates into natural calcite grain boundaries, this creates deep staining that mechanical methods cannot remove. Pore occlusion is nearly complete, with only 0.2% visible porosity remaining compared to the material's inherent 0.7%.

The laser absorption coefficient before treatment measures only 0.25 due to this thick, reflective crust layer. Crystalline calcite structure is completely invisible beneath this homogeneous dark layer—perhaps 180 µm average thickness across the sample area. This contamination creates significant adhesion to the marble substrate, so removal requires precise energy control.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent-excellent surface restoration. The black crust is completely removed, revealing the original calcite crystalline structure with sharp intercrystalline boundaries. Surface roughness now measures Ra 4.2 µm—this represents 67% reduction from the contaminated state.

The marble surface shows clean grain boundaries with zero residual gypsum deposits. SEM analysis confirms complete contaminant removal while preserving the delicate calcite matrix. Porosity returns to 0.68%, nearly matching the original material specification of
