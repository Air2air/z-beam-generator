  This analysis documents the pre-cleaning surface condition at 500x magnification. The marble substrate is completely obscured by a heterogeneous contamination layer, approximately 15 to 20 micrometers thick—or more precisely, between 14.7 and 22.3 µm in the measured zones. This layer shows a complex stratigraphy with a dense, carbonaceous soot film directly on the mineral surface and a thicker, granular deposit of gypsum crystals (CaSO₄·2H₂O) above it, confirmed by prior EDX analysis. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra values measuring 8.5 µm, this creates significant light scattering and a matte, dark appearance.

Observing the contamination, the gypsum crust exhibits a well-interlocked, acicular crystal habit that penetrates the marble's microporosity (typically 0.7%). This penetration, it is very-very deep, perhaps 5-10 µm into the subsurface, which indicates a strong mechanical bond. The underlying soot layer acts as a cohesive film, filling the natural calcite grain boundaries and reducing the inherent reflectivity from a baseline of 35% to below 10%. The combined deposits create a continuous, non-reflective barrier that compromises the stone's aesthetic and physical properties.

  The laser cleaning process removes the contamination, so the surface becomes clean and the original marble substrate is fully exposed. At 500x magnification, the transformation is very clear: the 20 µm crust is completely ablated, leaving a surface with Ra of 1.2 µm—a significant reduction in roughness. The calcite crystal faces are now visible, showing sharp, clean cleavage planes and a restored reflectivity of approximately 32%. This technique uses precise parameter adjustment, because the wavelength and fluence (maintained below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold) selectively removed the dark deposits without inducing thermal damage like micro-fracturing or calcite decomposition. The surface integrity is excellent, with no evidence of melting or mineral phase change, confirming a successful functional restoration.
