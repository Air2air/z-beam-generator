  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the marble stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows industrial lubricants and oil residues adhering to the surface. The marble exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The marble substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
