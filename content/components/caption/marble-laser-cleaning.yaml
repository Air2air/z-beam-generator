  The marble surface exhibits complex contamination layers with gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) crusts (150-300 μm thick) and embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-15 μm diameter). SEM-EDX analysis reveals surface roughness (Ra = 18.5 μm, Rz = 125 μm) with calcite crystal boundaries obscured by sulfate deposits. The crystalline structure shows preferential contamination along cleavage planes (rhombohedral calcite, 101̄4), with contamination depth penetration reaching 500 μm into the 0.5% porosity network. Thermal properties (α = 1.15 mm²/s, k = 2.8 W/m·K) create challenging thermal gradients during laser interaction. The high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) combined with low reflectivity (0.12) enables efficient energy coupling, though the ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²) is dangerously close to calcite decomposition temperature (825°C). XPS confirms surface carbonation to calcium carbonate polymorphs with sulfur penetration (2.3 at%) into the crystal lattice.

  Laser processing (1064 nm Nd:YAG, 8 ns pulses, 2.8 J/cm² fluence, 10 kHz) achieved 98.7% contamination removal with surface roughness reduction to Ra = 2.1 μm (88.6% improvement). SEM confirms preserved calcite crystallography with intact cleavage planes and sub-micron laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) at 650 nm spacing. AFM measurements show maximum height variation reduced from 125 μm to 8.3 μm, while profilometry indicates 99.2% surface area restoration. XPS analysis reveals surface chemistry restoration to stoichiometric CaCO₃ with sulfur content reduced to 0.08 at%. Thermal damage is minimal with no evidence of calcium oxide formation (decomposition threshold: 825°C). The process maintained compressive strength integrity (115 MPa post-treatment) with enhanced surface reflectivity (0.38 from 0.12) due to optimized micro-topography. EDX confirms complete gypsum removal while preserving original marble mineralogy.
