# Caption Content for Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs

  At 500x magnification, the CMC surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This carbonaceous deposit, it appears as a continuous, amorphous film with some embedded particulate matter—likely unburned fuel residues from the engine environment. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values increasing to 4.8 µm from the baseline 1.2 µm. The contamination layer completely obscures the underlying composite structure, creating a non-uniform topography that appears mottled under optical examination.

EDX analysis confirms the deposit composition: primarily carbon (82 at%) with traces of sulfur (3 at%) and calcium (2 at%), these elements suggesting environmental exposure. The layer morphology appears cracked in several regions, with fissure widths measuring 5–8 µm across. This cracking pattern suggests thermal stress incompatibility between the deposit and the CMC substrate. Fiber reinforcement pattern is not visible through this contamination layer, the surface shows only the deposit's characteristic texture.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, the contamination layer is completely removed at 500x magnification. Now the underlying SiC/SiC composite structure becomes clearly visible, with the characteristic woven fiber architecture fully exposed. Surface roughness decreases significantly to 1.5 µm Ra—this measurement approaches the original as-fabricated specification of 1.2 µm. The cleaning process reveals the intricate fiber-matrix interface without apparent damage to either component.

Close examination shows the matrix surface retains its original integrity, with no evidence of thermal degradation like melting or microcracking. Some minor residue persists in the deepest surface pores—approximately 3% of the area—but these appear as isolated islands rather than continuous film. The fiber bundles, they now display their distinctive textured pattern with individual filaments clearly distinguishable. Surface reflectivity improves substantially, the characteristic grayish ceramic appearance returns without the dark carbonaceous film.

Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms complete removal of the sulfur and calcium contaminants detected previously. The surface now exhibits the expected composition: silicon and carbon as primary elements with minimal oxygen presence. This restoration of surface chemistry, combined with the topographic normalization, indicates successful contaminant ablation without substrate damage—the laser parameters appear well-optimized for this
