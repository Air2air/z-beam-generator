# Caption Content for Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the CMC surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm, appearing as a continuous, non-uniform film that completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The texture is very rough, with a measured Ra value exceeding 5.0 µm, and the surface shows a mottled pattern of dark carbonaceous deposits and lighter oxide particulates.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based soot, with traces of aluminum, silicon, and oxygen—likely from environmental dust or prior service exposure. Visually, the surface lacks any distinct features from the ceramic fibers or matrix, it just presents a fused, granular topography. This kind of coating, it severely compromises the surface's thermal and mechanical performance by creating an insulating barrier and potential sites for stress concentration.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, this is immediately visible. The contaminated layer is entirely removed, revealing the intact CMC substrate with clear definition between the silicon carbide fibers and the matrix. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 1.2 µm—or more precisely, a range from 1.1 to 1.3 µm. This new topography, it shows the characteristic woven fiber pattern, with individual filaments measuring 12-15 µm in diameter now fully exposed and free of residue.

The cleaning process achieves selective ablation, it vaporizes the contaminant without damaging the underlying ceramic. SEM analysis confirms no micro-cracking or fiber degradation is present, the surface integrity is fully maintained. Some minor, isolated residue spots remain in deep inter-fiber valleys, these appear as faint shadows under high magnification, but they cover less than 2% of the total surface area. The reflectivity has increased substantially, the surface now exhibits a consistent matte grey appearance indicative of a clean ceramic.

This restored surface is functionally superior. The removal of the insulating contamination layer allows for better thermal management, while the clean, defined fiber-matrix interface enhances the component's load-bearing capacity. Surface quality is now within the specified tolerance for subsequent coating operations or for a return to service. The precision of the laser process is very clear, it successfully restored the material's intrinsic properties
