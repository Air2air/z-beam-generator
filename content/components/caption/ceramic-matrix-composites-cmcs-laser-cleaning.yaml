# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the ceramic matrix composites cmcs Laser cleaning of CMCs utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the ceramic matrix and reinforcing fibers. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the CMC substrate, with parameters carefully controlled to stay below the ablation threshold of the SiC matrix (~10 J/cm²) while effectively removing oxides, carbon deposits, and other surface layers.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The ceramic matrix composites cmcs exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The ceramic matrix composites cmcs substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
