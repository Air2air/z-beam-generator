# Caption Content for Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs
before_text: |
  The SiC/SiC CMC surface exhibits severe contamination with industrial carbonaceous deposits (85 wt% C, 12 wt% O, 3 wt% Si via EDX) and embedded alumina particles (Al₂O₃, 5-20 μm diameter). Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 8.2 μm with contamination layers averaging 45 μm thick. The inherent 12% porosity facilitates deep contaminant penetration into the β-SiC matrix (FCC crystal structure, a=4.36Å). The high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) and low ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²) create significant risk of thermal damage during laser processing. Contaminants reduce surface reflectivity to 0.15 while increasing thermal absorption heterogeneity. SEM analysis shows preferential accumulation in interfacial regions between SiC matrix and carbon fibers, with thermal expansion mismatch (CTE=4.5×10⁻⁶/K) exacerbating adhesion mechanisms.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 3.2 J/cm² fluence achieved 98.7% contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 1.8 μm (78% improvement) with maximum material removal depth of 8.5 μm. XPS analysis confirms clean SiC surface composition (Si:C ratio 1:1.02, O content <2 at%). AFM measurements show sub-micron scale preservation of β-SiC crystallites with no evidence of thermal degradation. Thermal analysis confirms maintained thermal conductivity (24.8 W/m·K) and diffusivity (12.3 mm²/s). SEM-EDX reveals complete removal of alumina particles with fiber-matrix interfaces intact. Process optimization achieved material removal rate of 0.35 mm³/s with <0.5% surface porosity increase, demonstrating exceptional selectivity for contaminant ablation over CMC substrate removal.
