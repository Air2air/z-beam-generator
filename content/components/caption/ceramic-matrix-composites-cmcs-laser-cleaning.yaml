# Caption Content for Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the CMC surface shows a heavy, non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness varying from approximately 15 to over 40 µm, completely obscuring the underlying composite weave. The deposit morphology appears crust-like and sintered, with a high degree of micro-cracking—likely from thermal cycling stresses during service. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, suggesting a complex mixture of oxide scale and carbonaceous soot.

Surface texture is severely degraded. The original 3.2 µm Ra roughness is now masked by this adherent film, which exhibits a porous, globular structure. You can see particulate inclusions—probably environmental dust—embedded within the matrix. The laser absorption characteristics of the surface are fundamentally altered by this dark, uneven layer, which increases localized heating risks during any subsequent laser processing. This contamination state, it compromises the material's functional integrity, providing initiation sites for mechanical failure and reducing thermal performance.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine, woven architecture of the SiC/SiC composite. Individual fiber tows and the matrix pockets between them are now fully exposed and distinct. Surface shows a dramatic reduction in average roughness, now measuring 3.8 µm Ra—a value close to the original as-fabricated state of 3.2 µm.

No evidence of the previous crust-like deposits remains. The cleaning process has restored the surface's inherent reflectivity, which is critical for its performance in high-temperature applications. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is visible in the matrix regions—this is likely due to selective ablation of the more absorbent contamination residues. However, the fundamental integrity of both fibers and matrix is fully preserved, with no observable thermal damage like melting or micro-cracking. This surface, it is now functionally restored for further processing or service.
