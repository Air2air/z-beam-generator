# Caption Content for Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the CMC surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm, appearing as a continuous, non-uniform film that completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The topography is very irregular, with agglomerated particulate matter—likely carbonaceous soot and metal oxides from service—embedded throughout a darker matrix. Surface roughness is high, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 4.8 µm.

Examining the deposit morphology reveals a cracked-mud pattern, this is characteristic of thermally grown oxides. You can see fine, spherical particles, probably unburned carbon, adhering to the surface. Some areas show signs of localized degradation, perhaps from hot corrosion, which creates pits beneath the contamination. The overall surface reflectivity is very low, it appears matte and dark, which compromises any visual or eddy-current inspection potential. Fiber weave pattern of the composite is not visible at all.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, this is immediately obvious at 500x. The contaminant layer is entirely removed, the original CMC surface topography is now fully exposed and clearly defined. What was a 15 µm thick film is now gone, revealing the characteristic fiber-matrix architecture with precise definition. The SiC fibers, they are now clearly visible, each with a diameter of approximately 13.5 µm, and they sit within the ceramic matrix without any visible coating or residue.

Surface roughness shows a very significant improvement. Ra values have decreased to about 1.2 µm, this creates a much smoother profile that is closer to the substrate's native state. The previous mud-crack pattern is eliminated, replaced by the intrinsic granular texture of the sintered matrix. Some isolated, sub-micron particulate remnants may be present, but these are not bonded to the surface. Reflectivity increases substantially, the surface now has a distinct grey, metallic sheen.

Critical functional restoration is achieved. The interface between fiber and matrix is now clean, this is vital for maintaining the composite's mechanical integrity—any residual deposits at this interface can act as stress concentrators. No thermal damage, such as micro-cracking or melting, is observed on the
