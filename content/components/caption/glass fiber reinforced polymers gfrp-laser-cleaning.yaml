  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 96.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber-matrix bond.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
