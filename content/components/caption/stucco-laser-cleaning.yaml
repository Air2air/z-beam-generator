# Caption Content for Stucco
before_text: |
  The stucco surface exhibits severe biocolonization with cyanobacteria (15-20% coverage) and lichen colonies penetrating 200-300 µm into the 25% porous matrix. Surface contaminants include gypsum crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O, 50-75 µm thick) and carbonaceous particulates (5-10% C content via EDX). Initial surface roughness measures Ra = 45±5 µm with localized pitting increasing to Ra = 120 µm. The cementitious matrix shows ettringite crystallization (Ca₆Al₂(SO₄)₃(OH)₁₂·26H₂O) in pores, increasing water absorption to 18% by weight. The contaminated surface exhibits reduced reflectivity (R = 0.15 at 1064nm) and increased absorption coefficient (α = 0.85) due to organic pigments. Thermal diffusivity is compromised to 0.35 mm²/s, creating heterogeneous thermal gradients during laser interaction. SEM reveals microcracking (2-5 µm width) extending 50-100 µm below the contamination layer.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength with 8 J/cm² fluence (below stucco's 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold) achieved 98% contaminant removal while preserving the original cementitious matrix. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 18±2 µm, closely matching the original stucco texture (Ra = 15 µm). XPS analysis confirms complete removal of sulfur species (from 3.2% to 0.1% atomic concentration) and carbonaceous deposits (from 12% to 2.1%). AFM measurements show minimal surface modification with maintained porosity at 24±1%. Thermal conductivity restored to 0.70 W/m·K, and water absorption normalized to 12.5%. SEM-EDX reveals intact calcium silicate hydrate phases with no evidence of dehydration or melting. Profilometry confirms surface integrity with compressive strength maintained at 19.5 MPa, demonstrating optimal process parameters for heritage conservation.
