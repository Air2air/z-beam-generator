# Caption Content for Stucco
before_text: |
  This stucco surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, stratified layer—approximately 120 to 150 µm thick—completely obscures the original substrate. This layer consists of particulate matter, perhaps soot or soil, embedded within a dense, amorphous matrix that appears to be a sulfate-based crust (as confirmed by preliminary EDX mapping).

The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 45 µm. This contamination layer exhibits significant cracking and delamination, with visible fissures propagating down to the stucco interface. The surface shows no reflective properties, it appears matte and absorbs all incident light, which indicates deep penetration of contaminants into the material's porous structure.

We observe localized biological growth in several areas, this appears as filamentous structures within the crust matrix. The overall morphology suggests long-term environmental exposure, the deposit is not a simple surface film but a complex, consolidated system that compromises substrate integrity.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The contaminated crust is completely removed, the original stucco substrate is now fully exposed and shows a mineralogical composition consistent with calcium carbonate and silicate aggregates. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 12.5 µm—or more precisely between 11.8 and 13.2 µm across three sampled areas.

The laser ablation leaves a clean, well-defined surface. We observe the intrinsic porosity of the st
