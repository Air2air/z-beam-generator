  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the stucco masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The stucco exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The stucco substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
