# Caption Content for Stucco
before_text: |
  This stucco surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, stratified layer—approximately 120 to 150 µm thick—completely obscures the original substrate. This layer consists of carbonaceous soot, particulate matter, and biological growth, forming a cohesive film that fills the natural surface porosity. The surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measuring 45.2 µm, because the deposits create an irregular, undulating topography.

Analysis confirms the contamination is not superficial. The deposit penetrates deep into the pore network, perhaps 80% of the 15% material porosity is filled. This creates a weak boundary layer that compromises the stucco's structural integrity. The surface shows no reflectivity, it appears matte and absorbs all incident light due to the thick, dark coating. This condition is very-very bad for the material's long-term performance.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the original cementitious matrix. The surface roughness is now reduced to 12.7 µm, a very good result that preserves the natural substrate texture without damage. This process effectively cleans the surface, so the light gray color of the clean stucco is now visible.

The laser ablation selectively removed the deposits, this is clear from the clean, open pores. The porosity is fully restored—approximately 15%—and the surface integrity is maintained. We observe no micro-cracking or thermal alteration, which indicates perfect parameter control. This clean surface now has higher reflectivity, perhaps 20-25%, and the compressive strength of the original material is fully accessible. This is a very-very successful restoration.
