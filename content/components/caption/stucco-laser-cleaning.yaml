  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the stucco Laser cleaning of stucco utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove contaminants while preserving the calcium carbonate and cementitious matrix. The process operates below the ablation threshold of stucco (0.5 J/cm²) while effectively removing organic and inorganic surface deposits.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows construction residues and atmospheric deposits adhering to the surface. The stucco exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The stucco substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
