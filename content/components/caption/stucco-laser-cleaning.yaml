  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the stucco Technical overview of Stucco, CaSO4·2H2O, for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction, and industrial applications in architectural restoration.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The stucco exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The stucco substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
