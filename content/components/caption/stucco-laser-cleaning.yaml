# Caption Content for Stucco
before_text: |
  This stucco surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A complex deposit layer—approximately 120 to 180 µm thick—completely obscures the original substrate. This layer consists of particulate matter, perhaps soot and environmental dust, embedded within a dark, carbonaceous matrix that fills the natural surface pores.

The original surface texture is not visible, its roughness masked by this continuous film. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion in some areas, creating micro-fissures and delamination patterns. This non-uniform coverage suggests a weak boundary layer, a condition that typically facilitates removal. The underlying stucco's porosity, normally around 25%, appears reduced to nearly zero by this occluding deposit.

  This laser cleaning produces a very-very good transformation. The contaminant layer is completely removed, so the original stucco substrate is now fully exposed. Surface roughness measurements confirm this change, showing a return to the baseline Ra value of approximately 45 µm from the previous occluded state.

The cleaning process reveals the intrinsic microstructure—the fine granular composition of calcium silicate hydrates is clearly visible, and the natural pore network is fully reopened. No thermal damage is observed on the mineral crystals, this indicates the laser parameters stayed well below the 750°C thermal destruction point. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, from the previously darkened state back to its inherent 35% reflectivity at the laser wavelength.
