  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the travertine stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The travertine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The travertine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
