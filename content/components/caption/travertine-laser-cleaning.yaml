  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the travertine Travertine laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove surface contaminants while preserving the delicate calcium carbonate matrix. The 1064 nm wavelength provides optimal absorption for contaminant removal with minimal thermal penetration into the stone substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The travertine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The travertine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
