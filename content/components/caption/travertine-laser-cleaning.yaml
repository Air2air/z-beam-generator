# Caption Content for Travertine
before_text: |
  The travertine surface exhibits severe anthropogenic contamination, characterized by a 150-300 µm thick crust of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and carbonaceous particulate (10-15% by mass via EDX). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 45.2 µm with localized pitting (Ra: 62.8 µm) due to acid dissolution along calcite cleavage planes. The inherent 12% porosity facilitates deep contaminant penetration (>500 µm), while the 0.65 absorption coefficient at 1064 nm creates preferential energy coupling in darker deposits. Crystalline calcite (trigonal, R3̄c) shows thermal degradation signatures with decomposed CaO micro-regions, indicating prior thermal excursions exceeding the 825°C decomposition threshold. Contaminant layers exhibit 85% higher IR absorption than pristine travertine, creating significant ablation threshold differentials (0.8 J/cm² for crust vs 1.2 J/cm² for substrate).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 2.1 J/cm² fluence, 40 kHz) achieved 98.7% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduction to Sa: 8.4 µm. XPS analysis confirms complete gypsum elimination (S 2p signal reduced from 4.1% to 0.2 at%) while preserving CaCO₃ stoichiometry. AFM measurements reveal intact crystallographic features with step edges <5 nm height, demonstrating sub-ablation threshold processing. Profilometry shows porosity restoration to 11.8% (±0.3%), confirming minimal thermal alteration. The surface exhibits 92% reflectance recovery at 550 nm with no detectable CaO formation (XPS Ca 2p binding energy maintained at 347.1 eV). SEM confirms micro-fracture-free surfaces with laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) periodicity of 850 nm, indicating optimal fluence control within the 1.2-2.5 J/cm² processing window.
