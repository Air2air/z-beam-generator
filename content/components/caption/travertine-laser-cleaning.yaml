# Caption Content for Travertine
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the travertine surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a continuous dark film, completely obscuring the natural stone texture underneath. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values around 8.5 µm, which is significantly higher than the substrate's inherent roughness. EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based particulate matter—likely soot and environmental deposits—with localized concentrations of sulfur and calcium sulfate.

Looking closer at the surface morphology, the contamination fills the natural porosity completely. Pores that should be visible, they are instead capped with dark, crust-like formations. The deposit shows a stratified structure in cross-section, with a dense upper layer and more granular lower interface. This creates a very uneven surface topography, with peak-to-valley distances measuring up to 45 µm in some regions. The laser absorption characteristics are undoubtedly affected by this dark layer, which appears to have very low reflectivity.

The interface between contamination and stone substrate is not sharp but rather interpenetrating, particularly at the pore boundaries. Some deposits extend 5–7 µm into the pore channels, creating a mechanical anchoring effect that would make mechanical removal difficult. The overall surface shows no visible crystalline structure of the underlying calcite—just this homogeneous, dark gray layer that compromises both aesthetic and physical properties.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The 15–20 µm contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine travertine substrate beneath. Surface roughness now measures Ra 2.1 µm—a 75% reduction from the contaminated state—which closely matches the stone's inherent texture. The natural porosity pattern is fully restored, with pore diameters ranging from 10 to 200 µm clearly visible again without any obstructions.

The surface now exhibits the characteristic microcrystalline structure of calcite. Individual crystal faces reflect light brightly, creating a speckled appearance under magnification. This visual change corresponds to a measured increase in surface reflectivity to approximately 36%, which aligns with the material's baseline property of 38.2%. Some minor, sub-micron particulate residue remains in the deepest pore channels, but it constitutes less than 2% of
