  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the travertine stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The travertine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The travertine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
