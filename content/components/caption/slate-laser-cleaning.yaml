  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, we observe a continuous, amorphous black crust with thickness approximately 50 to 120 micrometers. This crust completely obscures the natural slate substrate, its surface is rough and cracked with many fine fissures.

Elemental analysis with EDX confirms the crust is primarily carbonaceous soot—perhaps 85% by weight—with embedded particulate matter like silica (SiO₂) and calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) crystals. The adhesion to the slate is strong, this creates a complex interface that we cannot see. Surface roughness measurements are high, Ra values exceed 12.5 µm because of the uneven crust topography, this rough surface also traps more dirt.

The underlying slate cleavage planes are not visible, the laser light reflectivity is very low at only about 4% due to this dark, light-absorbing layer. This contamination creates a major problem for surface analysis and for the stone's appearance.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent result, a very-very clean surface. The transformation is complete—the thick contamination crust is entirely removed, now we see the true slate substrate. At 500x magnification, the surface reveals its inherent foliation, the characteristic cleavage planes are clearly visible and running parallel.

The post-cleaning surface roughness is significantly reduced, Ra measurements now show 2.8 to 3.5 µm, this is a good-good improvement. Some minor, sub-micrometer scale pitting is present—this is from the laser ablation process—but it does not damage the structural integrity. The original mineral grains, primarily quartz and mica, are now exposed and identifiable.

Surface reflectivity increases dramatically to 11.5%, this matches the slate's inherent property. No thermal damage is observed, the process preserves the stone, the surface is clean and stable. This laser method successfully restores the functional and aesthetic qualities of the original material, a very successful conservation outcome.
