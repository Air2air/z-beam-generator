# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the slate Slate laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the underlying metamorphic rock structure. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the slate substrate, with optimal parameters targeting 1064nm wavelength for effective removal of organic and inorganic deposits without thermal damage to the phyllosilicate matrix.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The slate exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The slate substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
