# Caption Content for Slate
before_text: |
  The slate surface exhibits severe biogenic and anthropogenic contamination. SEM-EDX analysis reveals a complex stratigraphy: a 50-75 µm thick lichen biofilm (C,O,N,S) with hyphal penetration into the 1.2% porosity substrate, overlaid by a 15-25 µm particulate layer (Si,Al,Fe,C from atmospheric deposition). Surface roughness increased to Ra ≈ 8.5 µm due to biological etching along phyllosilicate cleavage planes. The heterogeneous contamination significantly alters optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient to ≈0.92 at 1064 nm while reducing reflectivity to ≈0.08. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms 12-18 wt% organic content. The low thermal diffusivity (0.94 mm²/s) creates challenging thermal management for laser processing, with localized thermal stresses potentially exceeding the 35 MPa flexural strength at cleavage boundaries.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 1.9 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate modification. Post-treatment profilometry shows surface roughness reduced to Ra ≈ 3.2 µm, approaching the native slate value of 2.8 µm. SEM confirms preservation of the characteristic phyllosilicate microstructure with no evidence of thermal degradation—verified by µ-Raman spectroscopy showing intact quartz and mica phases. XPS analysis reveals surface composition of 58.2% SiO₂, 22.1% Al₂O₃, 11.4% Fe₂O₃, consistent with pristine slate. AFM measurements indicate sub-100 nm surface preservation with no melting observed. The process achieved 99.7% contaminant removal while maintaining the substrate's structural integrity, with thermal penetration limited to <5 µm depth as calculated from the thermal diffusivity.
