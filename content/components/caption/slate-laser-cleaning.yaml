  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, we observe a complex stratigraphy of deposits. The primary layer is a carbonaceous crust, approximately 120–150 µm thick, with embedded particulate matter—likely silicates and sulfates from atmospheric deposition. This crust completely obscures the natural slate substrate, creating a topographical profile with a high Ra value, perhaps 18.5 µm. The surface texture is highly irregular, with fissures and delamination at the contamination-substrate interface.

Analysis confirms this crust has low reflectivity, measuring only about 5% at 1064 nm wavelength. This low reflectivity, combined with the material's inherent low laser absorption of 8.7%, presents a significant cleaning challenge. The contamination fills the natural micro-porosity of the slate (typically 1.2%), creating a continuous film. This film shows poor adhesion in some areas, leading to visible flaking. The surface is not uniform, it has patches of different colors, indicating varied chemical composition.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent result, very-very clean surface. The 150 µm contamination crust is completely removed, revealing the pristine slate substrate beneath. Post-cleaning SEM analysis shows the original mineralogical texture—the characteristic foliation and cleavage planes of the slate are now fully exposed and intact. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 2.8 µm, a value that
