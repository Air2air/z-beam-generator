  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the slate stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The slate exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The slate substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
