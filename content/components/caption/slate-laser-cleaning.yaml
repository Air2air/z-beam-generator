# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the slate stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The slate exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The slate substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
