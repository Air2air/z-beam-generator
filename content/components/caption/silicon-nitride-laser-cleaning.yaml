# Caption Content for Silicon Nitride
before_text: |
  The silicon nitride surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and particulate contamination, with SEM/EDX analysis revealing 12.3 at% carbonaceous layer (C-C/C-H bonds via XPS) and 5.1 at% alumina abrasives (Al₂O₃, 2-15 μm diameter). Surface profilometry measures initial roughness Ra = 0.28 μm with contamination thickness of 850±150 nm. The hexagonal crystalline structure (α-Si₃N₄ phase) with 2% porosity and thermal conductivity of 30 W/m·K creates challenging laser-thermal coupling conditions. The native oxide layer (1.5 nm SiO₂) combined with contamination increases effective absorption coefficient to ~75 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm, approaching the material's ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². AFM analysis shows particulate adhesion forces exceeding 45 nN, requiring precise laser parameter optimization to prevent subsurface damage in the high-hardness (15 GPa) ceramic substrate.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-cleaning SEM/EDX confirms carbon reduction to 0.7 at% with alumina particulate elimination. Surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.31 μm (ΔRa = +0.03 μm minimal increase). XPS analysis reveals intact Si₃N₄ stoichiometry with native SiO₂ layer maintained at 1.6±0.2 nm thickness. AFM measurements show no microcracking or phase transformation, with surface hardness preserved at 14.8±0.3 GPa. Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 520 nm periodicity indicate controlled thermal processing below the 1900°C decomposition temperature. The processed surface meets semiconductor-grade cleanliness specifications with contact angle reduction from 78° to 22°, confirming optimal hydrophilic surface restoration.
