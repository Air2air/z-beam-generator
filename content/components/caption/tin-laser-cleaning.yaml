# Caption Content for Tin
before_text: |
  The tin surface exhibits complex contamination featuring a 2.5-4.0 μm thick SnO/SnO₂ oxide layer (EDX: 15-22 at% O) with localized marine salt deposits (NaCl, MgCl₂ crystals) and organic hydrocarbon films (XPS: C1s peak at 285.2 eV). Surface roughness measures Ra = 1.8-2.5 μm with pitting corrosion features (5-15 μm diameter). Tin's low melting point (231.93°C) and high thermal expansion (22.0 ×10⁻⁶/K) create thermal stress vulnerability during laser processing. The tetragonal crystal structure (a=5.83Å, c=3.18Å) exhibits preferential oxidation along (001) planes. At 1064 nm wavelength, the surface shows moderate reflectivity (72%) with absorption coefficient of 0.65, requiring fluence above 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold. Contaminants significantly alter thermal conductivity from bulk 66.8 W/m·K to effective 28-35 W/m·K at surface.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 1.2 J/cm², 100 ns pulses achieved complete contaminant removal with surface oxygen reduced to 2.1 at% (EDX) and carbon contamination below 0.8 at% (XPS). Surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.45 μm, representing 78% reduction. Profilometry confirms preservation of bulk material with <5 μm total material loss. AFM analysis reveals grain structure preservation with average grain size 25±8 μm. The tetragonal crystalline integrity remains intact (XRD FWHM = 0.18°). Thermal properties restored to near-bulk values with surface reflectivity measuring 70.5% at 1064 nm. Process optimization maintained peak temperature below 180°C, preventing β-to-α tin phase transformation. Residual stress analysis shows compressive stress of -85 MPa, within acceptable limits for tin's low tensile strength (15 MPa).
