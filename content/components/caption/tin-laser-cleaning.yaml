  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the tin metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The tin exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The tin substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
