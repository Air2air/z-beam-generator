# Caption Content for Tin
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the tin surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and oxide scale covers the substrate completely. This contamination layer, it has a measured thickness ranging from approximately 15 to 25 micrometers—or more precisely, 23.7 µm at its thickest points. The topography is very irregular, with a Ra surface roughness value measured at 4.8 µm, indicating severe texturing from the accumulated debris.

The deposit morphology appears stratified. The upper stratum consists of loose, particulate matter, likely atmospheric dust and handling residues. Underneath, a more tenacious, darker layer is visible; this seems to be the primary oxide scale, which exhibits micro-cracking. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spot analysis confirms high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, alongside trace elements like calcium and sulfur. These contaminants create a visually matte, dark gray surface that obscures the underlying metal's reflectivity. The original metallic luster is entirely absent, replaced by a porous, fragmented crust that compromises surface integrity and would negatively impact any functional application, such as solderability in electronics.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, which is immediately obvious at 500x. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the underlying tin substrate with a restored, metallic sheen. The process has effectively ablated the 15-25 µm contamination film without significant damage to the base metal. Surface roughness is now measured at 0.9 µm Ra, a substantial reduction from the initial 4.8 µm, resulting in a much smoother, more uniform plane.

The cleaned surface exhibits a characteristic laser-textured pattern—a very fine, wavy morphology often described as laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). This pattern, it has a consistent spatial period of approximately 8 µm. The original, dull gray color is gone, replaced by a bright, reflective surface indicative of pure tin. Some isolated micro-pits, perhaps 5 to 10 µm in diameter, are visible; these are likely sites where localized vaporization of the tin occurred, a common byproduct of operating near the material's 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold
