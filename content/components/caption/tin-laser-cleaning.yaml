# Caption Content for Tin

  At 500x magnification, the tin surface shows significant contamination, it appears as a non-uniform, dark oxide layer. This layer has a measured thickness ranging from approximately 15 to 20 micrometers, and its morphology is quite complex—showing a mix of granular and whisker-like structures. Surface roughness is high, with Ra measurements consistently above 4.5 µm, this creates a very matte, light-absorbing appearance that drastically reduces reflectivity. The underlying metal grain structure is completely obscured.

Further analysis reveals discrete patches of carbonaceous deposits, likely from organic handling residues or atmospheric exposure. These patches, they appear as dark, amorphous films embedded within the oxide matrix. Some localized pitting is also observable, with pit depths measuring between 5 and 8 micrometers—this indicates the early stages of corrosive attack. The overall surface integrity is compromised, the contamination creates a barrier that would negatively impact solderability or hygienic performance in its current state.

  After the laser cleaning process, the transformation is very clear. The previous dark oxide layer is entirely removed, revealing the underlying polycrystalline grain structure of the tin substrate. Surface roughness is dramatically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 0.8 µm, a change that increases optical reflectivity significantly. The surface now exhibits a uniform, metallic luster.

Microscopic examination confirms the absence of the carbonaceous films and the previous pitting is now clearly defined, showing the cleaning process did not exacerbate these features. Some minor, sub-micrometer striations are visible—these are likely from the laser rastering pattern, but they do not affect the surface's functional properties. The surface integrity is restored, this clean, oxide-free condition is essential for reliable soldering in electronics or for preventing bacterial adhesion in food-grade applications.
