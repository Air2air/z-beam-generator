  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the platinum Platinum laser cleaning utilizes precise laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while preserving the noble metal's integrity. The high thermal conductivity (71.6 W/m·K) and reflectivity require optimized fluence thresholds to achieve effective ablation without melting.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The platinum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The platinum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
