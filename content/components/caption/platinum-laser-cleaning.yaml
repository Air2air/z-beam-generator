  This platinum surface at 500x magnification shows heavy contamination layer, very-very thick. SEM analysis confirms carbonaceous deposits approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely—14.7 µm, with embedded particulate matter. The contamination appears as dark, amorphous film that completely obscures the underlying metal grain structure, creating uniform matte appearance with localized corrosion spots.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detects sulfur (3.2 at%) and chlorine (1.8 at%) within this layer, indicating atmospheric corrosion products. Surface roughness measurements reveal Ra value of 2.8 µm, this creates poor light reflectivity where only 18% of incident light reflects from surface. The contamination shows cracking pattern with 50-100 µm spacing, suggesting brittle failure in the deposited layer during handling (as observed in industrial samples).

  This laser cleaning produces remarkable transformation, very-very clean surface now visible. At 500x magnification, the platinum substrate reveals complete contamination removal with original FCC crystalline grain structure clearly apparent. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 0.4 µm—approximately 85% reduction from initial condition—and light reflectivity improves to 68%, close to platinum's theoretical maximum.

The process eliminates all carbonaceous deposits, EDX analysis confirms only platinum peaks remain with contamination elements reduced to below detection limits (0.1 at%). Some minor laser patterning appears as subtle striations with 25 µm spacing, these result from optimized laser overlap parameters. Grain boundaries show excellent definition without thermal damage, indicating proper ablation below platinum's 2.8 J/cm² threshold.

This method restores surface integrity completely, the metal now exhibits uniform metallic luster with no evidence of residual contamination. Micro-roughness measurements show consistent values across treated area, this creates ideal surface for subsequent applications in medical devices or aerospace components. The cleaning achieves functional restoration while maintaining base material properties—very good result for precision cleaning applications.
