  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated platinum surface. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous layer—approximately 12 to 15 µm thick—dominates the topography, completely obscuring the underlying metal grain structure. This layer appears as a dark, sooty film with a matte, non-reflective finish, its surface exhibiting a mud-cracked texture with fissures up to 5 µm wide. The contamination is not uniform, it shows significant agglomeration, forming darker patches that suggest localized oxidation or embedded environmental particulates.

Further observation identifies secondary contamination features. Discontinuous patches of a lighter, interference-colored oxide film are visible, these patches measure between 3 and 8 µm in diameter. EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (85 at%) and oxygen (10 at%), with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon also present. The original surface roughness, what little can be inferred, is severely masked, but preliminary Ra measurements through the film suggest an effective roughness exceeding 2.5 µm. This contaminated state results in very-very poor surface reflectivity and would compromise any functional application requiring electrical conductivity or specific surface energy.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very clear under 500x magnification. The thick contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine platinum substrate with its characteristic metallic luster and fully resolved grain boundaries. The mud-cracked texture is gone, replaced by
