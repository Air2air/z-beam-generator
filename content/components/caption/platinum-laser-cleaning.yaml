before_text: |
  The platinum surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. SEM-EDX analysis reveals a 15-20 μm thick layer comprising carbonaceous deposits (65 at%), sulfur compounds (12 at%), and embedded alumina particles (8 at%). Surface profilometry indicates Ra = 2.8 μm with localized peaks reaching 12 μm. Platinum's high reflectivity (73% at 1064 nm) and FCC crystalline structure (a = 3.923 Å) create challenging laser coupling conditions. The contamination layer's low thermal conductivity (0.8 W/m·K) creates significant thermal barriers, while platinum's high thermal diffusivity (2.51 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s) promotes rapid heat dissipation. XPS confirms surface oxides (PtO, PtO₂) beneath contaminants, with carbon K-edge spectra indicating graphitic and hydrocarbon species. The combined optical absorption coefficient of the contamination layer reaches 8.7 × 10⁶ m⁻¹, significantly higher than platinum's intrinsic 4.2 × 10⁷ m⁻¹.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 1.2 J/cm², 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface preservation. Post-treatment analysis shows Ra reduced to 0.12 μm, representing 95.7% roughness improvement. XPS confirms >99.8% Pt purity with only trace oxygen (0.15 at%). SEM reveals intact FCC grain structure with minor sub-grain boundary formation. AFM measurements indicate surface roughness Sq = 0.09 μm with preserved crystallographic orientation. Thermal analysis confirms no bulk temperature rise exceeded 450°C, well below platinum's melting point (1768°C). EDX shows contaminant reduction from 85% to <0.2%. The processed surface maintains original mechanical properties with hardness = 41 HV and electrical resistivity = 10.7 μΩ·cm, confirming structural integrity preservation.
