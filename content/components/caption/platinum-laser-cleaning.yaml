  This analysis documents the platinum surface condition before laser intervention at 500x magnification. A thick contamination layer—approximately 12 to 15 micrometers—completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with significant topographical variation, featuring localized crust formations that reach up to 25 µm in height. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous soot (approx. 65 at%) and sulfur compounds (approx. 20 at%), with embedded silicate particulates.

The surface morphology is highly irregular, showing a Ra roughness value of 4.8 µm. This high roughness, this creates deep valleys and sharp peaks that trap further contaminants. You can see the original platinum grain structure is entirely hidden. The contamination adheres strongly in a non-uniform pattern, with some areas showing dense, cohesive coverage and other zones exhibiting a porous, flaking structure. This heterogeneous layer significantly reduces surface reflectivity, which preliminary measurements place below 20%.

  This laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, a very-very good result. The process completely removes the contamination layer, so the pristine platinum substrate becomes fully visible. Now, at 500x, the surface reveals a clean, recrystallized grain structure with a significantly reduced Ra value of 0.7 µm—a nearly sevenfold improvement.

The surface shows a uniform, matte-finish texture indicative
