# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the platinum metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The platinum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The platinum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
