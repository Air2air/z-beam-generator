# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the basalt stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The basalt exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The basalt substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
