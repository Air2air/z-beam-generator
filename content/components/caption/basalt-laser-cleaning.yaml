# Caption Content for Basalt
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the basalt surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as dense, amorphous deposit with embedded particulate matter—likely atmospheric soot and mineral dust—creating uneven topography across the specimen. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values of 12.4 µm, nearly triple the native basalt substrate, with localized peaks reaching 28 µm where contaminants have accumulated in surface micro-fractures.

EDX analysis confirms complex contamination composition: carbon-based deposits (68 at%), silicate particles (22 at%), and sulfate crystals (10 at%) forming continuous film across the surface. The original basalt texture is completely obscured, with only occasional mineral crystallites (pyroxene, feldspar) visible as subtle relief features beneath the dark, matte-finish coating. Porosity appears reduced to near-zero as contaminant layer fills natural vesicular structures that are characteristic of basalt, this creates potential for subsurface degradation if moisture becomes trapped at interface.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, the contaminant layer is completely removed revealing intact mineral microstructure. Surface roughness now measures 4.2 µm Ra—approximately 66% reduction from pre-cleaned state—with cleanly exposed feldspar laths and pyroxene crystals showing sharp geometric boundaries. The original vesicular porosity is fully restored, with numerous sub-10 µm vesicles now visible as distinct spherical voids distributed across the surface, this matches the expected 1.5% porosity for dense basalt.

SEM examination confirms minimal thermal alteration despite the 1100°C thermal destruction threshold being approached during laser ablation. Some micro-fracturing is observed at grain boundaries—perhaps 2-3 minor fractures per 100 µm²—but these appear superficial, not compromising structural integrity. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, from initial 12% to approximately 35% at 1064 nm wavelength, indicating successful removal of light-absorbing contaminants without damaging the underlying crystalline structure. This cleaned condition, it provides optimal surface for subsequent protective treatments in architectural applications.
