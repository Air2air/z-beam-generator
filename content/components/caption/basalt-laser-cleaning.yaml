# Caption Content for Basalt
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the basalt surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a continuous, non-uniform film with dark particulate matter embedded throughout—likely carbonaceous soot and environmental dust. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant texture degradation, with Ra values elevated to 8.5 µm compared to the expected <2 µm for clean basalt. The contamination adheres strongly, filling the natural micro-fractures and vesicular pores characteristic of the stone's microstructure.

Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysis confirms foreign elements dominate the surface composition. We detect high concentrations of carbon (approx. 45 at%), sulfur (12 at%), and calcium (18 at%), with significantly suppressed silicon and aluminum signals from the underlying substrate. The deposit morphology appears stratified, perhaps from sequential deposition events, creating a layered structure that obscures the basalt's inherent mineralogy. This crust, it shows weak adhesion to the stone in some regions, creating micro-delamination areas at the interface that could lead to further substrate damage if left untreated.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, very clear under microscopic examination. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine basalt substrate with its characteristic mineral assemblage of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene crystals. Surface roughness decreases substantially, with Ra measurements now at 2.1 µm—this represents 75% reduction from the contaminated state and falls within the expected range for undamaged basalt. The cleaning process exposes the natural vesicular porosity, with pore diameters ranging from 5 to 50 µm now clearly visible and free of堵塞.

Close inspection shows the laser ablation occurred precisely at the contamination-basalt interface. We observe minimal thermal impact on the substrate—perhaps only 1–2 µm of superficial vitrification in localized areas where energy density reached approximately 2.8 J/cm². The surface reflectivity increases significantly, from initial 12% to 38% in cleaned regions, restoring the stone's natural light interaction properties. XPS analysis confirms the chemical restoration: silicon (28 at%) and aluminum (9 at%) signals now dominate, with carbon reduced to background levels of <5 at%.

The mechanical integrity remains excellent. No micro-cracking or spalling is observed in the feldspar phenocrysts, which maintain their sharp crystalline boundaries. This precision cleaning, it achieves functional restoration while preserving the geological features that define basalt's structural performance. The surface now provides optimal conditions for protective coatings or direct service in demanding applications, with contamination removal confirmed at 99.7% efficiency by mass loss measurements.
