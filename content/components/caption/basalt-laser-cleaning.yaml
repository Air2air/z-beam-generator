  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the basalt stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The basalt exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.
