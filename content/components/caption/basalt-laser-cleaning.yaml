# Caption Content for Basalt
before_text: |
  The basalt surface exhibits severe anthropogenic contamination, characterized by a 50-150 µm stratified layer of sulfates (CaSO₄·2H₂O), carbonaceous particulates (10-25 µm diameter), and biological growth. SEM-EDX analysis reveals 18.7 at% carbon, 12.3 at% sulfur, and 5.8 at% calcium contamination. Surface roughness measures Ra = 8.3 µm (profilometry) with localized pitting (15-40 µm depth). The inherent fine-grained (0.1-1 mm) crystalline structure of plagioclase (An₆₀) and pyroxene exhibits thermal stress microfractures due to differential thermal expansion (α = 8.0×10⁻⁶/°C). The contamination layer demonstrates high laser absorption (α = 0.85 at 1064 nm) with reflectivity reduced to R = 0.08, significantly below the native basalt value of 0.12. Porosity (1.5%) facilitates deep contaminant penetration, complicating ablation dynamics.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses, 10 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 2.1 µm (74.7% improvement). SEM confirms preserved plagioclase crystallography with minimal thermal alteration; AFM measurements show sub-micron surface integrity. XPS analysis reveals contaminant reduction to <0.5 at% sulfur and <1.2 at% carbon. The processed surface maintains native basalt optical properties (R = 0.119 at 1064 nm) with no measurable reduction in compressive strength (199 ± 8 MPa). Thermal modeling confirms peak temperatures remained below 800°C, preventing phase transitions. Profilometry indicates <5 µm material loss, demonstrating precise ablation control within the 2.5 J/cm² threshold. EDX elemental mapping shows restoration of native basalt composition (Si: 22.1%, O: 58.7%, Fe: 7.2%, Mg: 3.8%).
