# Caption Content for Gorilla Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the Gorilla Glass surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The primary contaminant appears as a carbonaceous soot layer, approximately 3–5 µm thick, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 15 µm. This layer displays a matte, topographically complex surface that completely obscures the underlying glass substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of carbon (85 at%), oxygen (10 at%), and trace silicones (5 at%), suggesting a mixture of combustion byproducts and fingerprint residues.

The contamination morphology is highly irregular, featuring a network of fine fissures and a cauliflower-like surface texture that increases the effective surface area. This porous structure traps significant light, reducing measured reflectivity to less than 15%—a substantial drop from the native 42.5%. Surface roughness measurements across this deposit yield an Ra value of 1.8 µm, a significant increase from the pristine glass baseline of 0.5 nm Ra. The particulate matter is firmly adhered, with some regions showing evidence of localized thermal degradation, perhaps from prior exposure events.

  Laser cleaning achieves a complete restoration of the native Gorilla Glass surface. The previously opaque contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the pristine, transparent substrate beneath. Post-process SEM analysis confirms the removal of all foreign material, with EDX spectra now showing a composition of 60 at% silicon and 40 at% oxygen—matching the expected stoichiometry of the base glass.

The surface now exhibits its characteristic smoothness, with Ra measurements returning to the specified 0.5 nm. This topographical restoration directly correlates with a recovery of optical performance; reflectivity measurements confirm a return to the baseline 42.5%. A close inspection at 500x reveals no evidence of laser
