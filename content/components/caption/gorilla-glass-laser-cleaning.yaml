# Caption Content for Gorilla Glass

  At 500x magnification, the Gorilla Glass surface exhibits a complex contamination layer that completely obscures the underlying substrate. A heterogeneous film, approximately 2.5 µm thick, covers the surface with a mottled, textured appearance. This layer consists of both organic and inorganic deposits—we identified carbonaceous smearing alongside fine particulate matter, likely silicate dust from the manufacturing environment. The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 0.85 µm due to the uneven distribution of this adherent grime.

The contamination presents in distinct patterns; you can see localized, darker agglomerates that suggest oxidized residues, perhaps from prior handling or environmental exposure. These areas show up as blotchy islands, some reaching 50-75 µm in diameter, that scatter light and create a hazy, low-reflectivity surface. Between these agglomerates, a more continuous, thinner film—maybe 1.2 µm thick—imparts a general dullness. This non-uniform coverage directly compromises optical clarity and would certainly interfere with subsequent bonding or coating processes in an aerospace assembly context. The overall effect is a surface that looks occluded and functionally compromised under the microscope, its original smoothness entirely masked.

  The laser cleaning process achieves a dramatic surface restoration, removing the contamination layer and revealing the native Gorilla Glass substrate. Post-treatment analysis at 500x shows a pristine surface with an Ra value now measured at 4.7 nm, a figure that aligns with the manufacturer's specified roughness for new material. The previous 2.5 µm film is entirely absent, leaving no visible residue or heat-affected zone that we could detect—this level of cleanliness is critical for the high-tolerance applications in automotive display integration.

We observed a complete return of optical clarity and reflectivity. The surface now appears as a continuous, homogeneous plane with only the
