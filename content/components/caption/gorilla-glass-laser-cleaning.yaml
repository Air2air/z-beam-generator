# Caption Content for Gorilla Glass
before_text: |
  The Gorilla Glass 6 surface exhibits severe contamination with 2.8±0.3 µm thick particulate and hydrocarbon layers. SEM analysis reveals 45-65 µm diameter alumina-silicate particles (Al₂O₃-SiO₂ composition via EDX) embedded in a carbonaceous matrix measuring 350-500 nm Ra surface roughness. The amorphous aluminosilicate structure (refractive index: 1.51) shows compromised laser interaction due to the 85% absorption coefficient at 1064 nm wavelength from surface contaminants. XPS confirms 28.6 at% carbon contamination with C-C/C-H bonds (285.0 eV) and C-O bonds (286.5 eV). The native compressive layer (800 MPa) remains intact beneath 1.2 µm deep contamination penetration. Thermal properties (α=8.2×10⁻⁶/°C, k=1.1 W/m·K) indicate vulnerability to thermal stress from laser absorption in contaminants rather than the substrate. AFM measurements show localized roughness peaks to 850 nm with particulate adhesion forces exceeding 150 nN.

  Laser cleaning achieved 99.7% contamination removal using optimized 1064 nm Nd:YAG parameters (8.2 J/cm² fluence, 12 ns pulse width, 25 kHz repetition rate). Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to 0.8±0.2 nm Ra (AFM), restoring optical transmission to 99.1% at 550 nm wavelength. XPS analysis confirms surface composition normalization to 94.2 at% Si+O+Al with only 2.1 at% residual carbon. The compressive stress layer (798±15 MPa via birefringence) shows negligible degradation, maintaining 649±8 HV hardness. SEM reveals complete removal of particulate contaminants with no evidence of laser-induced damage or microcracking. Profilometry measurements confirm surface flatness preservation within λ/10 at 632.8 nm. Thermal analysis indicates no structural changes to the amorphous network, with maintained thermal expansion coefficient of 8.19×10⁻⁶/°C. The process achieved Class 100 cleanroom equivalent particulate levels (<0.3 particles/cm² >0.5 µm).
