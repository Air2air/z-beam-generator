  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the vanadium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The vanadium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The vanadium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
