  At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform oxide and carbonaceous deposit layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, exhibits a complex topography of blister-like protrusions and micro-fissures. The underlying metal substrate is entirely obscured by this dark, tenacious film, which displays a matte, granular texture. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, suggesting the presence of vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅) and adsorbed hydrocarbons.

The surface roughness is significantly elevated due to this contamination, with initial Ra measurements indicating values of approximately 4.5 µm. One can observe particulate matter, likely atmospheric dust and process residues, embedded within the thicker oxide regions. The adhesion of this layer appears strong, as evidenced by the lack of spalling at the edges of the observed micro-fissures. This compromised surface condition, it would severely degrade the material's functional properties in a nuclear or aerospace context, particularly its thermal performance and resistance to further corrosion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the underlying vanadium substrate with a restored, metallic luster. The surface now exhibits a lightly textured appearance, a direct result of the laser-material interaction, which has produced a recast layer with a fine, cellular solidification structure. This new microstructure, it is characterized by a network of fine ridges—perhaps 5 to 10 µm in width—formed from rapidly resolidified material.

Quantitative surface profilometry confirms a dramatic improvement, with the Ra value now reduced to 1.2 µm, a 73% decrease from the initial state. The cleaning efficacy is nearly total, as EDX analysis shows the oxygen atomic percentage has dropped from over 60% to a mere 3-5%, indicating a surface passivated with only a thin, protective oxide. This precision in contaminant removal, it preserves the substrate integrity; no evidence of bulk melting or micro-cracking is detected. The restored surface, with its controlled roughness and minimal oxide presence, should provide excellent adhesion for coatings and significantly improved performance in its intended application, a truly sophisticated outcome.
