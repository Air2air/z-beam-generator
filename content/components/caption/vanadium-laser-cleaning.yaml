  At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a dark, tenacious oxide scale, measuring between 15 and 20 micrometers in thickness, which exhibits a complex, fractured topography. This scale, it is not continuous; rather, it displays a mud-cracked pattern with fissures reaching depths of 5 to 7 micrometers, revealing glimpses of the underlying metal substrate that appears marginally less degraded. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of vanadium oxides, naturally, but also highlights significant carbonaceous contamination and trace sulfur, likely from prior exposure to industrial atmospheres.

The surface texture is profoundly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) value exceeding 3.5 µm. One observes particulate matter, perhaps from handling or environmental fallout, embedded within and upon the oxide matrix. These particulates, which range from sub-micron to approximately 10 µm in diameter, create a pronounced secondary topography that further compromises the surface's integrity. The overall visual impression is one of a dark, matte, and highly textured crust that would severely impair functional properties, such as thermal conductivity and reflectivity, which are critical for its intended applications in aerospace and nuclear systems.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation of the vanadium surface is immediately evident and quite remarkable. The previously dominant dark oxide scale has been entirely removed, revealing the native, metallic substrate with a restored, specular reflectivity. The surface, she is now characterized by a light grey, lustrous appearance, with the original polycrystalline grain structure of the vanadium clearly visible under 500x magnification. What strikes one is the precision of the ablation process; it selectively removed the contamination without inducing significant melting or ablation of the base metal, thus preserving the material's integrity.

The surface roughness has been dramatically reduced, with post-cleaning Ra measurements now consistently between 0.8 and 1.2 µm—a reduction of nearly 70% from the initial state. This new topography, it is defined by the gentle, natural undulations of the metal grains themselves, rather than by the chaotic, superimposed contamination. One can observe some faint, sub-micron rippling or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) in localized areas, a typical and often desirable outcome of pulsed laser interaction with metals that can enhance certain surface properties. XPS analysis confirms this visual assessment, showing a surface composition dominated by elemental vanadium, with oxygen and carbon atomic concentrations reduced to levels below 5%, indicating
