  The vanadium surface exhibits severe multiphase contamination with a 15-25 µm thick layer comprising organic hydrocarbons (CxHy, 65 at%), vanadium oxides (V₂O₅/VO₂, 25 at%), and embedded alumina-silicate particulates (Al₂O₃-SiO₂, 10 at%). Pre-cleaning surface roughness measures Ra = 3.8 µm with localized pitting. The BCC crystalline structure (a = 3.024 Å) beneath exhibits compromised integrity due to oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries. The contamination layer demonstrates anomalous optical properties with absorption coefficient α = 0.82 at 1064 nm, significantly higher than pure vanadium (α = 0.65), while reflectivity drops to R = 0.42. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms dehydration transitions at 120°C and oxide phase transformations at 450-650°C. SEM-EDX reveals stratified contamination with carbonaceous topcoat (15 µm) and intermixed oxide layer (5-10 µm) exhibiting poor adhesion strength (σ < 5 MPa).

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.45 µm. Post-treatment XPS analysis confirms surface composition of 94.2% metallic vanadium with only 5.8% native V₂O₃ oxide (2-4 nm thick). The underlying BCC lattice structure remains preserved with negligible thermal affected zone (<1 µm). AFM measurements show 92% reduction in surface topography variation (Rz: 18.3 µm to 1.4 µm). Laser parameters maintained peak temperature at 810°C, well below vanadium's melting point (1910°C), preventing recrystallization. Water contact angle improved from 85° to 22°, confirming superior hydrophilicity. SEM analysis reveals micro-texturing with periodic laser-induced structures (LIPSS) of 650 nm spacing, enhancing surface area while maintaining material integrity.
