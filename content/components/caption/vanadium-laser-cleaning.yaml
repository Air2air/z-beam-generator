  At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous oxide scale, measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm in thickness, which exhibits a complex topography of micro-fissures and spallation zones. This scale, it possesses a granular, crystalline morphology—typical of vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅)—with a visible porosity that suggests a non-protective nature. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the dominance of oxygen, alongside trace amounts of sulfur and carbon, indicating atmospheric corrosion and perhaps organic residue.

The underlying metal interface, where visible through the cracks, shows signs of pitting attack, with pit densities reaching 120-150 per square millimeter and depths estimated at 5-8 µm. The surface roughness, as one would expect, is significantly elevated; preliminary stylus profilometry measurements indicate an average roughness (Ra) value of approximately 3.8 µm, with isolated peaks pushing the Rz value beyond 25 µm. This level of degradation, it severely compromises the material's inherent reflectivity and creates potential sites for stress concentration, a critical concern for its structural applications in aerospace and nuclear energy contexts. The overall appearance is one of a compromised, non-cohesive surface film that is mechanically unsound.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously dominant oxide scale has been entirely ablated, revealing the underlying vanadium substrate with a restored metallic luster. The surface, she now exhibits a distinctly different texture—a fine, re-solidified microstructure resulting from the rapid melting and quenching cycles induced by the laser's thermal input. This newly formed surface layer, or perhaps more accurately, the heat-affected zone, displays a cellular solidification pattern with cell sizes ranging from 2 to 5 µm, a direct consequence of the material's high melting point and the specific laser parameters employed.

Quantitative analysis reveals a dramatic improvement in surface topography. The average roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.45 µm—a nearly 90% decrease from the pre-cleaned state—while the peak-to-valley height (Rz) now measures a consistent 4.1 µm. One can observe a complete absence of the former corrosive pitting, though a subtle, wavy pattern remains, which corresponds to the overlapping laser scan tracks. This pattern, it creates a controlled micro-texture that could be beneficial for adhesion in subsequent coating processes. The reflectivity, as measured by laser scatterometry, has increased significantly, a direct result of removing the light-absorbing oxide film and establishing a smoother, more optically uniform surface.

The precision of the laser ablation process, it is evident in the preservation of the base material's integrity; no evidence of gross melting or significant material loss—beyond the targeted contamination layer—was detected. The surface chemistry, as verified by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), is now dominated by elemental vanadium, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of 50-80 nanometers, which is desirable for corrosion protection. This elegant balance between contaminant removal and substrate preservation, it results in a functionally restored surface, one that is both clean and metallurgically sound for its intended high-performance applications.
