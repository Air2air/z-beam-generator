  This surface shows heavy contamination layer, very-very thick carbonaceous deposits. At 500x magnification, we observe uniform dark film covering entire composite surface, this layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely 14.7 µm—thickness. The contamination completely obscures underlying glass fiber pattern and resin texture, creating matte black appearance with no reflectivity.

Surface roughness increases significantly due to contamination adhesion, Ra measurements show 8.3 µm compared to baseline 1.8 µm. The deposit exhibits micro-cracking pattern with fissures spacing 50-75 µm apart, these cracks reveal slight substrate discoloration beneath. Particulate matter—likely environmental soot and industrial fallout—embeds within carbon matrix, creating heterogeneous surface topography with height variations up to 25 µm. This contaminated condition severely compromises surface functionality and aesthetic quality.

  This laser cleaning produces remarkable transformation, very-very clean surface restoration. The process completely removes carbonaceous contamination layer, so original composite microstructure becomes clearly visible again. At 500x magnification, we now observe distinct glass fiber bundles and polyester resin regions with sharp interface definition, surface returns to near-original state.

Surface roughness decreases dramatically to 2.1 µm Ra, this represents 75% reduction from contaminated condition. The laser ablation leaves minimal residue—only occasional carbon particles remain in deep micro-pores—while achieving 98% contamination removal by area analysis. Some subtle texture changes occur
