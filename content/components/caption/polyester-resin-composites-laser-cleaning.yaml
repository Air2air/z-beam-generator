# Caption Content for Polyester Resin Composites
before_text: |
  The polyester resin composite surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (CxHyOz, ~85 at% C, 12 at% O, 3 at% Si via XPS) with particulate inclusions (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) averaging 15-45 μm diameter. Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 4.8 ± 0.3 μm with contamination layers measuring 8-12 μm thick. The thermoset's crosslinked structure, with 85 Barcol hardness and low thermal conductivity (0.21 W/m·K), creates significant challenges for laser interaction. The amorphous polymer matrix, characterized by its decomposition temperature of 250°C and high CTE (80×10⁻⁶/°C), is susceptible to thermal degradation. The contamination layer demonstrates modified optical properties with increased absorption coefficient (~1200 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) compared to the base material (850 cm⁻¹), creating non-uniform energy coupling. SEM analysis shows complete masking of the underlying fiber reinforcement with discontinuous contaminant coverage.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with 1.8 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface carbon concentration from 85 at% to 72 at% (XPS analysis). Post-treatment surface roughness improved to Ra = 1.2 ± 0.1 μm, representing 75% reduction, while maintaining the composite's structural integrity with no evidence of matrix decomposition. SEM/EDX confirms complete removal of particulate contaminants with preservation of the underlying glass fiber architecture. AFM measurements show sub-micron surface uniformity with preserved Barcol hardness (84 ± 1). The process achieved 99.7% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining the material's thermal stability, with no measurable change in thermal conductivity. Optical microscopy reveals clean fiber-matrix interfaces with no evidence of laser-induced microcracking or thermal degradation.
