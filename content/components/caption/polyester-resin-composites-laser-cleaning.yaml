  This analysis documents the surface condition before laser intervention at 500x magnification. A thick contamination layer, approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm—is clearly visible, this layer completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The deposits appear as a continuous, amorphous film with a sooty, particulate texture, and EDX analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content, suggesting hydrocarbon-based soiling mixed with some silicate particles (as observed in prior studies).

The surface itself shows significant degradation beneath the contamination layer. We observe many micro-cracks, perhaps from thermal cycling, and the original fiber reinforcement is not visible. Surface roughness measurements are high, with an Ra value of approximately 8.5 µm, this creates a very-very uneven topography. The overall appearance is dark and matte, a direct result of light scattering from the complex surface geometry and the light-absorbing contamination.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the result is very-very good. At 500x magnification, the contaminated layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine polyester resin matrix and the embedded glass fibers. The surface integrity is now fully restored, with no evidence of the previous micro-cracks or subsurface damage that we were concerned about.

Quantitative measurements confirm this visual improvement. The surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 1.2 µm, this creates a much smoother plane that is good-good for adhesion. The reflectivity
