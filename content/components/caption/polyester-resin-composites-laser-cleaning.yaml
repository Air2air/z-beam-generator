  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination, very-very clear under 500x magnification. A thick carbonaceous layer—approximately 25 to 40 µm thick—covers the entire composite surface, this layer completely obscures the underlying polymer texture. The deposit is not uniform, it shows a cracked-mud pattern with fissures up to 5 µm wide, and embedded particulate matter, likely soot and environmental dust, is visible throughout.

The contamination layer has a spongy, porous morphology that increases surface roughness significantly. Initial Ra measurements indicate a value of approximately 18.5 µm, a tenfold increase from the substrate's baseline. This degraded surface shows no fiber exposure, the glass reinforcement is completely hidden. The soot layer exhibits low reflectivity, it appears matte black and absorbs most incident light, which is a typical characteristic of heavy carbon deposition on polymer composites (as seen in fire-damaged specimens).

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good result, the surface transformation is dramatic. The thick contamination layer is completely removed, this reveals the original polyester resin matrix with a measured surface roughness now at 2.1 µm Ra—a value that nearly matches the original substrate specification. The cleaning exposes the woven fiber pattern, individual glass filaments are now clearly visible, they show no thermal damage from the laser ablation process.

The surface color reverts to the composite's native light-beige tone, this indicates minimal oxidative damage. Reflectivity increases substantially, from near-zero to approximately 14%, which is close to the material's inherent reflectivity. Some minor sub-surface porosity—about 2.5%—is now observable, these are inherent to the composite and not cleaning artifacts. The process restores surface integrity, the fiber-matrix interface appears intact and well-bonded, which is critical for structural performance in marine and aerospace applications.
