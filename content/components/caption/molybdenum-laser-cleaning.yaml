  At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface shows heavy contamination. A dark, discontinuous oxide scale covers approximately 80% of the surface area, its thickness measuring between 3 to 5 micrometers. This layer, it has a cracked, mud-caked morphology that appears non-uniform under the microscope. Particulate contamination—composed of embedded carbonaceous soot and fine alumina grit from prior processing—is clearly visible, scattered across the surface.

Surface roughness is significantly elevated. Initial Ra measurements indicate an average roughness of 2.8 µm, a value heavily influenced by the porous, fractured nature of the oxide film. The underlying metal grain structure is completely obscured. This contamination layer, it creates a diffuse, matte appearance that would severely compromise functional performance in applications requiring high reflectivity or specific surface energy. The integrity of the base material is not assessable in this state.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the native metallic substrate with a restored, specular reflectivity. At 500x, the surface now displays the characteristic grain structure of molybdenum, with well-defined grain boundaries and a noticeably smoother topography. Quantitative measurement confirms this: the average surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.4 µm, an 85% improvement from the initial state.

The cleaning process has selectively ablated the oxide and particulate matter without damaging the underlying metal. Some minor features remain—shallow, sub-micron pits that correspond to the original sites of the most tenacious oxide nodules. These features, however, do not detract from the overall surface integrity. EDX analysis confirms the removal of carbon and oxygen signals, with the surface composition now showing 99.2% molybdenum.

This restored surface condition directly enhances material performance. The high reflectivity is critical for thermal management in electronics, and the clean, oxide-free surface promotes better adhesion for subsequent coatings in aerospace components. The process effectively resets the surface to a near-pristine state, which is very important for its functional restoration in demanding applications. Final inspection shows the surface is now suitable for high-vacuum environments and precision bonding operations.
