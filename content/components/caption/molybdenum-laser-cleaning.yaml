before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the molybdenum Molybdenum laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The process leverages Molybdenum's high melting point (2623°C) and thermal conductivity (138 W/m·K) to achieve precise ablation of oxides and contaminants while preserving base material integrity.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The molybdenum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The molybdenum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
