before_text: |
  The molybdenum surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C: 65 at%, O: 28 at%, Mo: 7 at%) with localized oxide islands (MoO₃, 200-500 nm thick) confirmed by XPS. Profilometry measures an average surface roughness (Sa) of 1.8 μm with contamination layer thickness varying between 2-8 μm. The underlying BCC crystalline structure (lattice parameter: 3.147 Å) shows compromised thermal transport due to the insulating contamination layer (thermal conductivity: ~0.2 W/m·K), significantly impeding heat dissipation from the substrate's intrinsic 138 W/m·K. SEM reveals particulate adhesion (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) and organic films creating localized absorption hotspots. The contamination reduces effective laser coupling, altering the surface's native 58% reflectivity at 1064 nm and creating non-uniform absorption profiles that risk thermal runaway during laser processing.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 100 ns pulse width, 10 kHz) achieved 99.7% contamination removal, reducing carbon content to <0.5 at% via XPS quantification. Surface roughness improved to Sa = 0.15 μm, with AFM revealing nanoscale laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) of 650 nm periodicity. EBSD analysis confirms preservation of the BCC grain structure with minimal HAZ (<2 μm depth). The surface maintains molybdenum's intrinsic thermal properties (138 W/m·K conductivity) with a protective 15 nm MoO₂ layer formed. EDX shows elemental purity >99.9% Mo, while contact angle measurements demonstrate restored hydrophilicity (θ = 22°). The process achieved Class 100 cleanliness specifications with surface particulate count <5 particles/cm² >0.3 μm, qualifying for semiconductor manufacturing applications.
