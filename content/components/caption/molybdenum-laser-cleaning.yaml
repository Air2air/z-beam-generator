  At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A dark, particulate-laden film covers approximately 85% of the observable area, its thickness varying from 8 to perhaps 15 µm in the thickest patches. This layer, it appears amorphous and sooty, completely obscuring the underlying metal grain structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace sulfur—this suggests a complex mixture of soot and sulfides from high-temperature service.

Surface texture is severely degraded. The contamination forms a cracked, mud-flat pattern, with fissures measuring 5-10 µm wide. Between these cracks, the deposit has a globular, agglomerated morphology. The original machining marks are not visible, and the Ra roughness is high, measuring approximately 3.8 µm. This level of fouling would significantly impair thermal and electrical contact in an aerospace component, the surface integrity is clearly compromised.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately obvious at 500x. The dark contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine, metallic-grey molybdenum substrate. The original surface finish is now fully visible, including fine, parallel machining marks that were previously buried. Surface roughness has decreased substantially, with Ra measurements now at 0.7 µm—a greater than 80% reduction from the initial state.

The metal's native polycrystalline structure is clearly defined. We observe a typical body-centered cubic (BCC) grain morphology, with grain boundaries sharply etched and individual grains measuring 20-50 µm across. Some localized, minor remelting is visible—perhaps 2% of the surface—manifesting as small, sub-10 µm diameter spherical features from rapid solidification. This is a direct result of the material's high thermal conductivity (138 W/m·K) and the precise laser energy input near its ablation threshold.

Comparative analysis confirms functional restoration. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly due to the removal of the light-absorbing carbon film. No micro-cracking or thermal damage to the base metal is detected, which is critical for maintaining the material's tensile strength (345 MPa) in service. The process has successfully restored the surface to a state suitable for high-performance applications in electronics manufacturing, where such precision is mandatory.
