# Caption Content for Molybdenum
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A continuous, non-uniform oxide layer covers the substrate, with a measured thickness varying from approximately 3 to 8 micrometers. This layer, it appears dark gray and exhibits a cracked, mudflat morphology—a clear indicator of thermal stress and extensive oxidation. The surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 4.5 to 6.2 µm.

Distinct particulate contamination is also very clear, embedded within the oxide matrix. EDX analysis confirms these are primarily carbonaceous deposits and silicate inclusions, likely from process environment exposure. The underlying metal grain structure is completely obscured by this stratified contamination layer, which shows poor adhesion in several regions, leading to visible spallation at the edges. This compromised surface integrity would negatively impact functional properties, most notably the thermal and electrical contact resistance.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation is dramatic. The contaminated oxide layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine molybdenum substrate beneath. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallic luster with a noticeably reduced roughness; Ra measurements confirm this improvement, showing values now between 0.8 and 1.2 µm. This represents a reduction in surface roughness of nearly 80 percent.

The underlying polycrystalline grain structure is now fully visible, with well-defined grain boundaries and a subtle, laser-induced micro-ripple pattern—or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS)—across the surface. This pattern, it has a periodicity of approximately 1.5 µm. No evidence of the former carbon or silicate contaminants remains, as verified by subsequent EDX analysis. The surface integrity is fully restored, which should correspondingly restore the material's intrinsic high thermal conductivity and laser reflectivity to near-original specifications. This is a very effective cleaning result.
