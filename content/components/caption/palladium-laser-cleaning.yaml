before_text: |
  The palladium surface exhibits severe contamination with a multi-layer structure: a 15-25 µm thick carbonaceous soot layer (85 at% C, 8 at% O, 7 at% H) overlying a 2-5 µm oxide scale (PdO, PdO₂). Surface roughness measures Ra = 3.8 µm, Rz = 28.5 µm with visible intergranular corrosion penetration to 8 µm depth. The FCC crystalline structure (a = 3.890 Å) shows surface deformation with increased dislocation density (10¹² cm⁻²). Contamination significantly reduces optical reflectivity to 38% at 1064nm, increasing absorption coefficient to 2.3×10⁶ cm⁻¹. Thermal conductivity is compromised to 45 W/m·K in contaminated regions, creating heterogeneous thermal gradients during laser interaction. EDX analysis confirms 12.3 at% sulfur and 5.8 at% chlorine contaminants at grain boundaries.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength, 8ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.45 µm, Rz = 3.2 µm. XPS analysis confirms 99.2% pure Pd surface with oxygen content reduced from 18.3 at% to 0.8 at%. The FCC crystal structure remains intact with minimal grain growth (average grain size 25.4 µm → 26.1 µm). Microhardness measures 41.2 HV, indicating no thermal degradation. Optical reflectivity restored to 70.5% at 1064nm. AFM topography shows atomic-scale smoothing with step-terrace features characteristic of Pd(111) surfaces. Residual thermal stress measures <15 MPa via XRD peak broadening analysis. Process achieved 99.97% contamination removal efficiency with <0.5 µm material loss.
