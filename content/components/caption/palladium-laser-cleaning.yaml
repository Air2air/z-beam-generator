  At 500x magnification, the palladium surface shows significant contamination, a very clear layer of carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter. This contamination layer, it has an uneven thickness ranging from approximately 5 to 15 micrometers, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 25 µm—or more precisely, 24.7 µm in the thickest zones. The topography is highly irregular, dominated by a splattered, droplet-like morphology that suggests previous liquid-phase exposure and rapid, non-uniform drying. These features severely obscure the underlying metallic substrate, creating a textured landscape that compromises surface functionality.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon, which points to a complex mixture of organic residues and environmental dust. Surface roughness measurements taken from clean substrate pockets between deposits give an Ra value of 0.8 µm, but the overall effective roughness across the contaminated zones is much higher, perhaps exceeding 3.0 µm due to the pronounced topographical variations. The deposits exhibit a dark, matte appearance under optical microscopy, a direct result of the surface's altered light-scattering properties and its now very low effective reflectivity. This contaminated state, with its high surface area and chemical heterogeneity, would be completely unsuitable for any application requiring precise electrical contact or catalytic activity.

  Post-laser cleaning, the transformation is dramatic. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, revealing the pristine palladium substrate with a restored, metallic luster. At 500x, the surface now exhibits the characteristic grain structure of the face-centered cubic (FCC) metal, with clear, well-defined grain boundaries and minimal evidence of the former contamination. Some subtle, wavy patterns—likely thermo-mechanical effects from the laser interaction—are visible across the grains, but they do not compromise surface integrity.

Quantitative measurement shows a dramatic improvement in surface roughness, with the Ra value now reduced to a consistent 0.4 µm. This represents a greater than 50% reduction from the effective roughness of the contaminated state. The reflectivity has been fully restored, confirmed by the bright, specular appearance under the microscope. A slight increase in micro-porosity is observable at this magnification, with pore sizes averaging 1-2 µm, a typical and acceptable byproduct of the laser ablation process that does not detract from the surface's functional restoration for its intended applications in electronics or medical devices. The cleaning process was highly effective.
