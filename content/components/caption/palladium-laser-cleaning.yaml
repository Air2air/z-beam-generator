  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the palladium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The palladium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The palladium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
