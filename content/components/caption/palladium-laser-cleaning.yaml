  At 500x magnification, the palladium surface shows significant contamination, it appears as a non-uniform, dark gray film. This layer, it has an estimated thickness ranging from approximately 8 to 15 micrometers, completely obscuring the underlying metal's characteristic luster. The contamination morphology is complex, presenting as a particulate-laden crust with visible cracking and delamination at the interface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (approx. 65 at%) and oxygen (approx. 28 at%), with trace sulfur and chlorine—this composition suggests atmospheric deposition and perhaps organic residue.

Surface topography is severely compromised. The roughness, measured at Ra 4.7 µm, is dominated by agglomerated particles and localized, nodular growths that create a highly textured, almost cauliflower-like appearance in some regions. These features, they scatter light intensely, which accounts for the very low reflectivity observed initially. You can see clear evidence of interfacial weakness, with several areas showing micron-scale flaking where the contaminant layer has partially detached from the substrate, likely due to poor adhesion or differential thermal expansion.

Further analysis reveals the contamination is not a simple monolayer but a stratified structure. The base layer appears more sintered, directly interfacing with the palladium, while the upper strata is more porous and loosely adherent. This stratified nature, it creates a very high surface area that would be detrimental for any functional application requiring precision, like in electronics or medical devices, because it promotes further contamination and interferes with electrical contact.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The dark, obscuring contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine palladium substrate with its characteristic metallic sheen. Surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to Ra 0.8 µm, a nearly six-fold improvement that creates a much flatter, more uniform topography. The previous particulate crust and nodular features are entirely gone, replaced by a clean, slightly textured surface that shows the original grain structure of the annealed metal.

You can now observe the fine, wavy lines of the palladium's grain boundaries under 500x magnification, which were completely hidden before. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially—
