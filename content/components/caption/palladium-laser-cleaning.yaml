  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the palladium Palladium laser cleaning utilizes precise laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while preserving the metal's catalytic properties and electrical conductivity. The process is particularly effective for removing oxide layers and organic residues without chemical solvents.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The palladium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The palladium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
