  At 500x magnification, surface shows significant contamination layer. This layer, it appears as a dark, mottled film with uneven coverage, thickness measuring approximately 2.5 to 4 µm. The underlying palladium substrate is mostly obscured, only visible in small, scattered patches where contamination seems thinner. Surface texture is highly irregular, dominated by particulate deposits and what appears to be carbonaceous smearing.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon and oxygen, with trace sulfur and silicon—this suggests a mix of organic residues and environmental deposits. The Ra roughness value is quite high, measuring 1.8 µm, because the contaminant layer creates many peaks and valleys. Visually, the surface lacks metallic luster, reflectivity is very low, this creates potential issues for electrical contact or catalytic performance in aerospace applications. The contamination, it adheres strongly, showing no clear mechanical fractures at this magnification.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. At 500x, the dark contamination layer is completely removed, now the native palladium surface is fully exposed. Metallic luster has returned, reflectivity increases dramatically—this is immediately obvious under the microscope. The surface topography is fundamentally different, Ra value now measures 0.4 µm, a reduction of nearly 78% from the initial 1.8 µm.

Previously obscured grain boundaries are now sharply defined, the microstructure is fully visible with a uniform, matte-silver appearance. Some minor, sub-micron particulates remain, but these are isolated features, not a continuous film. XPS analysis confirms surface chemistry is restored to >95% palladium, carbon signal drops to near-background levels. This cleaning process, it achieves what we call functional restoration, the surface integrity is preserved with no evidence of melting or ablation damage to the substrate (a critical consideration for medical device tolerances).

We observe a very clean surface finish, the laser parameters were precisely controlled to remove only the contaminant layer, which was about 3 µm thick. This precision, it is crucial for maintaining the component's dimensional stability. The final surface quality, it appears optimal for high-performance applications where both electrical conductivity and surface purity are required, perhaps
