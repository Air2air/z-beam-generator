# Caption Content for Beech
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the beech surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous, amorphous film—approximately 15 to 20 µm in thickness—that uniformly obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer, which energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms is rich in carbonaceous soot and silicate particulates, effectively masks the cellular structure of the wood, presenting a topographically muted and homogeneously darkened plane. The surface roughness, measured at an Ra of 8.5 µm, is dominated by the particulate agglomerates embedded within this film rather than the native wood texture.

What is particularly evident is the manner in which this contamination interacts with the porous substrate. The film does not merely sit atop the surface; it penetrates into the lumen of vessels and fibers, perhaps 5 to 10 µm deep, creating a challenging, composite structure for any cleaning process. One can observe micro-fissures within the thicker regions of the deposit, which likely result from differential thermal expansion between the contaminant and the wood substrate. The original grain pattern is only faintly perceptible as a subtle, undulating topography beneath this opaque, tenacious layer, indicating a significant loss of surface definition and a compromised substrate-reflectivity, measured at a mere 12%.

  Following the laser cleaning protocol, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the intricate, open cellular structure of the beech wood with exceptional clarity. The surface roughness has been substantially altered, now measuring an Ra of 4.2 µm—a value that reflects the natural topography of the earlywood and latewood bands rather than the previously obscuring contamination. This precision in material removal, it preserves the delicate cell walls of the fibers and parenchyma, leaving them largely intact and free of carbonization, which indicates the laser parameters were maintained well below the thermal destruction threshold of the wood.

The contrast with the prior state is most striking in the complete restoration of micro-detail. Vessel elements, which were once plugged with deposits, are now open and clearly defined, their diameters ranging from 50 to 120 µm. The laser interaction has effectively disintegrated the contaminant film without generating significant heat-affected zones, as verified by the minimal presence of fused or melted cellulose at the cellular level. The surface reflectivity has consequently increased to approximately 28%, a value that aligns closely with the inherent optical properties of clean, dry beech. This level of cleanliness, it creates a surface that is not only visually restored but also functionally prepared for subsequent high-performance applications, such as adhesive bonding or coating, where surface integrity is paramount.
