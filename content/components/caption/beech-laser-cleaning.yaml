  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the beech wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The beech exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The beech substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
