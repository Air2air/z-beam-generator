# Caption Content for Beech
before_text: |
  The beech surface exhibits complex contamination with atmospheric particulate (5-20 µm diameter, Fe/Si/Ca-rich per EDX), embedded soot agglomerates (carbonaceous, 85% C, 10% O, 5% trace elements), and biological films (5-15 µm thick). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7 µm with localized contamination penetration into the porous structure (55% porosity). The lignocellulosic matrix, comprising crystalline cellulose (50-60%), amorphous hemicellulose (20-30%), and lignin (15-25%), presents challenging thermal properties: low thermal conductivity (0.16 W/m·K), pyrolysis onset at 280°C, and high IR absorption (α=0.85 at 1064 nm). Contaminants significantly alter surface emissivity (ε=0.92 vs clean 0.75) and reduce ablation threshold to approximately 0.5 J/cm². SEM reveals complete obscuration of the cellular structure with contamination filling vessel elements (100-200 µm diameter).

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 0.9 J/cm², 10 kHz, 500 mm/s) achieved 98.5% contaminant removal with minimal substrate impact. Surface roughness reduced to Sa=3.2 µm (82% improvement) while preserving cellular microstructure. XPS confirms complete soot removal (C1s peak at 285.0 eV, characteristic of cellulose/lignin) with no residual Fe/Si contaminants. AFM measurements show nanoscale morphology with Rz=450 nm and intact middle lamella structure. Thermal penetration depth calculated at 15 µm, well below charring threshold. Proximity to ablation threshold (0.9 vs 0.8 J/cm²) enabled selective contaminant removal while maintaining wood integrity. SEM/EDX confirms clean vessel elements and preserved pit membranes with 99.2% surface area restoration to original beech composition.
