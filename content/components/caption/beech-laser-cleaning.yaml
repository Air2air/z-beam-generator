# Caption Content for Beech
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the beech surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous, amorphous film, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, which effectively obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer, it exhibits a mud-cracked morphology, with fissures approximately 2-5 µm wide, suggesting a desiccated organic substance—perhaps a degraded varnish or accumulated grime. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of exogenous elements, including silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and calcium (Ca), which are indicative of embedded particulate matter from environmental exposure.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12 µm due to the uneven deposition and the trapping of soot particles within the porous structure. One can observe a complete loss of the original cellular detail; the vessel elements and rays of the beech are entirely masked. The contaminant layer itself shows areas of differential adhesion, with some regions flaking at the edges, revealing a darker, carbonized sub-layer directly adjacent to the wood substrate. This sub-layer, likely a product of prior, low-grade thermal degradation, measures a more consistent 5-7 µm and appears tightly bonded, presenting a significant challenge for non-destructive removal.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The thick, obscuring contaminant film has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, anatomical structure of the beech wood beneath. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 3.5 µm—or more precisely, between 3.2 and 3.8 µm across the sampled area—which is consistent with the natural texture of undamaged beech. The elegant cellular architecture, including the distinct lumen of the vessels and the intricate pattern of the medullary rays, is now fully visible and exquisitely detailed, with no evidence of the former, obscuring deposits.

What strikes one is the precision of the material removal; the laser interaction has selectively vaporized the contamination layer with a fluence carefully maintained just above the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold for beech, thereby minimizing thermal penetration. The result is a surface that exhibits only minimal, localized charring, confined to the lignin-rich cell walls and measuring less than 2 µm in depth—a consequence of the material's pyrolysis onset at 280°C being briefly exceeded. This minimal thermal alteration, it is a far superior outcome compared to the
