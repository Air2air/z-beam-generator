# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the beech Beech wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its cellulose-lignin composition. The 1064nm wavelength provides effective absorption while minimizing thermal damage, enabling precise removal of surface contaminants without altering the wood's natural structure.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The beech substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
