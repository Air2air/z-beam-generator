  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the kevlar-reinforced polymer Laser cleaning of Kevlar-reinforced polymer composites requires precise control of fluence to selectively remove contaminants without damaging the aramid fiber reinforcement or polymer matrix. The 1064 nm wavelength provides optimal absorption for most surface contaminants while minimizing thermal damage to the composite substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The kevlar-reinforced polymer exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The kevlar-reinforced polymer substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
