# Caption Content for Kevlar-Reinforced Polymer
before_text: |
  The Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C15-C28 aliphatic chains, ~45 at% carbon via XPS) with embedded alumina-silicate particulate (5-12 μm diameter, 15% surface coverage). Surface roughness increased to Ra = 4.2 μm (profilometry) with contamination layer thickness of 18±3 μm. The poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) crystallites (orthorhombic unit cell, 0.72 nm periodicity) show compromised interfacial adhesion due to contaminant penetration. The material's low thermal conductivity (0.52 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) create significant thermal management challenges. SEM reveals contaminant wicking along Kevlar-matrix interfaces, while EDX confirms 8.3 at% Si and 4.1 at% Al from particulate deposition. The surface reflectivity dropped to 0.08 due to contaminant absorption characteristics.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence (below 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold), and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 2.1 μm. SEM analysis confirms preserved Kevlar fibrillar structure with <0.5% fiber damage. XPS shows carbon content normalized to 68 at% (characteristic of clean composite), with oxygen reduced from 32% to 24%. AFM measurements indicate maintained crystallographic integrity with surface temperature controlled below 300°C (oxidation threshold). The process achieved 99.7% contaminant removal efficiency while preserving 98% of original tensile strength. Post-treatment profilometry confirms surface uniformity within ±0.3 μm, with reflectivity restored to 0.11±0.02 at 1064 nm.
