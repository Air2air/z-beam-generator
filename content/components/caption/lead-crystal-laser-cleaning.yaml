# Caption Content for Lead Crystal
before_text: |
  The lead crystal surface exhibits complex contamination with 15.2±3.1 μm thick stratified layers. SEM-EDX analysis reveals 68.5 wt% carbonaceous soot (amorphous carbon), 22.3 wt% calcium sulfate dihydrate deposits, and 9.2 wt% silica particulate matter. Surface profilometry indicates severe degradation with Ra=4.8±0.7 μm and Rz=38.2±5.3 μm. The inherent low thermal conductivity (0.78 W/m·K) and high lead oxide content (24-32%) create significant thermal stress vulnerability during laser irradiation. Contaminants demonstrate enhanced absorption at 1064 nm (α=0.15 cm⁻¹), potentially triggering premature ablation below the crystal's 2.8 J/cm² threshold. Crystalline domains show micro-fracturing at phase boundaries due to differential thermal expansion (9.2×10⁻⁶/K) between contaminants and the lead silicate matrix. AFM mapping confirms localized surface plastic deformation with 120-180 nm deep micro-pits.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduction to Ra=0.12±0.03 μm. XPS analysis confirms surface composition restoration to 71.3 at% O, 23.8 at% Si, and 4.9 at% Pb, matching pristine lead crystal stoichiometry. White light interferometry documents 99.7% particulate removal efficiency with preserved refractive index (1.56±0.01). Thermal damage assessment via micro-Raman spectroscopy shows no evidence of phase transformation or lead reduction. AFM measurements reveal atomic-scale smoothing with RMS roughness of 0.8 nm over 50×50 μm scan areas. Transmission remains at 91.8% of original value, confirming structural integrity. Process optimization achieved material removal rate of 0.24 μm/pulse with heat-affected zone limited to <150 nm depth.
