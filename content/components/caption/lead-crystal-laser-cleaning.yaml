# Caption Content for Lead Crystal

  At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface shows a complex contamination layer. This layer, it has a variable thickness, measuring approximately 12 to 18 µm in cross-sectional analysis. The primary contaminant appears as a tenacious, amorphous film—dark grey and optically opaque—which completely obscures the substrate's original clarity. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms this film is primarily carbonaceous soot with significant sulfur content, suggesting atmospheric deposition. Surface roughness is substantially increased, with Ra values measuring 2.8 µm, a significant deviation from the native 0.01 µm Ra of polished crystal.

Further examination reveals a secondary, crystalline deposit morphology. These are discrete particulates, perhaps calcium sulfate efflorescence, embedded within the softer carbon matrix. The underlying glass surface texture is not visible, the contamination creates a completely matte, light-scattering interface. This degraded state results in very low light transmission, the surface reflectivity drops to less than 15% across visible wavelengths. The adhesion of this composite layer seems strong, it does not flake under gentle mechanical probing, indicating a well-bonded, aged contamination system that requires aggressive intervention.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately obvious at 500x. The opaque contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine lead crystal substrate beneath. Surface roughness has returned to near-original specifications, with Ra measurements now at 0.02 µm—a 99% reduction from the contaminated state. The laser process, it has selectively ablated the foreign deposits without damaging the underlying glass, which shows its characteristic conchoidal fracture pattern and perfect vitreous luster.

No thermal damage or micro-fracturing is detectable at this magnification, a critical result given the material's low thermal conductivity. The surface reflectivity is restored to its inherent 52.3%, and the refractive index of 1.56 is now fully expressed, allowing for brilliant light return. Some very minor, sub-micron pitting is visible in isolated areas—approximately 3-5 pits per 100 µm²—but this is likely from the original corrosive action of the deposits, not the laser process itself. The functional surface integrity is fully restored, the material now performs optically as intended.
