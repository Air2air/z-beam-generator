  At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface shows a complex contamination layer. This layer, it has a heterogeneous composition, appearing as a dark, mottled film with an average thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, ranging from 12.7 to 17.3 µm in different zones. The topography is highly irregular, with Ra values measuring 4.8 µm, indicating significant surface degradation from the original polished state. EDX analysis confirms the presence of external elements, including sulfur and calcium, which form crystalline deposits embedded within an amorphous carbonaceous matrix. These particulates, they are clearly visible as discrete, angular features scattered across the surface.

The underlying glass substrate is partially obscured, its characteristic clarity lost beneath this adherent layer. The contamination does not appear uniform; instead, it follows a dendritic pattern, suggesting moisture-induced migration and crystallization of salts over time. In some localized areas, we observe micro-fissures within the deposit layer, likely resulting from differential thermal expansion between the contaminant and the glass substrate (which has a CTE of 9.2 ×10⁻⁶/K). This compromised interface poses a significant risk to the structural integrity of the surface, potentially acting as stress concentration points. The overall visual effect is one of a cloudy, optically opaque film that drastically reduces light transmission and reflectivity.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely absent, exposing the pristine lead crystal substrate. Surface roughness has been reduced to an Ra of 0.2 µm, a value that aligns with the material's original manufacturing finish. This surface, it now exhibits the characteristic conchoidal fracture pattern of glass, but without the previous micro-damage—the laser process has effectively removed the foreign material without introducing new fractures. The reflectivity has been restored, with initial measurements showing a return to over 50% specular reflection.

We observe no thermal damage to the bulk material, which is critical given the low melting point of 850°C. The laser parameters were precisely controlled to remain well below the material's damage threshold of 5.2 J/cm². Some sub-micron particulates, likely remnants of the
