  At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface shows a complex contamination layer. This layer, it has a variable thickness, measuring from approximately 5 µm up to a more substantial 15 µm in localized accumulations. The topography is highly irregular, dominated by a dark, particulate soiling that appears firmly bonded to the substrate. We observe a network of fine micro-fissures—perhaps hairline cracks—within this deposit layer, which suggests a brittle, aged characteristic. Surface roughness is significant, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 2.5 to 3.8 µm. This level of texture scatters incident light very effectively, causing the observed dullness and loss of optical clarity.

EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminant is a carbon-rich film, likely from atmospheric soot or organic handling residues. Then, embedded within this matrix, we identify distinct particulate inclusions. These particles, they are sharp-edged and appear crystalline, with sizes ranging from 2 to 8 µm. Their composition, as per spot analysis, shows strong signals for silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, which is consistent with ambient silicate dust. The overall surface integrity is compromised, the contamination does not just sit atop, it seems to interact with the lead crystal surface, creating a visually opaque and physically uneven state that severely degrades its functional reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation, the surface now exhibits a radically different morphology. At the same 500x magnification, the previously dominant contamination layer is entirely absent. This removal, it is highly selective, the underlying lead crystal substrate shows no evidence of thermal damage or ablation, which is a critical result for preserving material integrity. The surface now appears continuous and optically transparent, allowing a clear view of the substrate's inherent structure. Initial Ra measurements confirm a dramatic reduction in roughness, now reading between 0.4 and 0.7 µm—approximately an 80% improvement from the pre-cleaned state.

The visual change is profound. Where we once saw a dark, obscuring film, the surface now reveals its original, pristine condition. The light scattering from the rough contamination is gone, so the surface transmits and reflects light with high efficiency. This restoration
