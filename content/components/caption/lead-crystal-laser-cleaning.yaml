  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the lead crystal Laser cleaning of lead crystal utilizes precise pulsed Nd:YAG laser parameters to selectively ablate surface contaminants while exploiting the material's high thermal expansion coefficient and low thermal conductivity to prevent substrate damage.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The lead crystal exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The lead crystal substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
