# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the mortar masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows industrial lubricants and oil residues adhering to the surface. The mortar exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mortar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural soundness.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
