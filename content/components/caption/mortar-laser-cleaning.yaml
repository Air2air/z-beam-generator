# Caption Content for Mortar
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the mortar surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous, dark biological film—likely a consortium of cyanobacteria and fungi—with an average thickness of approximately 45 µm, though it reaches up to 80 µm in localized colonies. This biofilm, it exhibits a mucilaginous, cohesive structure that effectively occludes the underlying substrate, masking the natural granular texture of the mortar. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high concentrations of carbon and oxygen, alongside trace sulfur and phosphorus, which is consistent with organic metabolic byproducts.

Beneath this organic layer, one can observe a discontinuous crust of particulate matter, primarily composed of carbonaceous soot and silicate particles from atmospheric deposition. This secondary layer, it has a variable thickness ranging from 10 to 25 µm and is firmly adhered to the mortar surface through the binding action of the biofilm. The original surface topography is completely obscured, resulting in a Ra surface roughness value measured at 18.7 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent texture. The profound laser absorption coefficient of this composite layer, estimated at 0.85, indicates a surface that is highly efficient at converting optical energy to thermal energy, a critical factor for the subsequent cleaning process.

  Following the laser cleaning intervention, the microscopic analysis reveals a dramatic transformation, with the original mortar substrate now fully exposed and largely free of contamination. The stratified deposit layers have been completely ablated, a process confirmed by the absence of the characteristic carbon and sulfur peaks in post-treatment EDX spectra. The surface, she now displays the intrinsic mineral aggregate—primarily quartz and limestone sand—with clear boundaries between the cementitious matrix and the fine aggregate particles, which was entirely invisible before.

The laser interaction, it has produced a remarkably clean surface with a measured Ra roughness of 4.2 µm, a value that aligns closely with the known profile of sound, unweathered mortar. One can observe minimal thermal alteration; only isolated, sub-micron vitrification spots are present, indicating that the laser fluence was maintained precisely at or just above the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold. This precision, it has preserved the original surface integrity while achieving a reflectivity increase from an initial 0.25 to a final value of 0.28, a subtle but functionally significant restoration of the material's inherent optical properties. The porosity is now clearly visible and measurable at approximately 15%, confirming the successful removal of pore-clogging contaminants without inducing micro-fracturing.
