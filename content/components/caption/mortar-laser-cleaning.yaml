before_text: |
  The contaminated mortar surface exhibits complex multi-layer deposition, featuring a 150-300 µm thick crustose layer of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum: CaSO₄·2H₂O) intermixed with carbonaceous particulates (10-15 vol% carbon). Surface roughness measures Ra = 45.2 µm with localized pitting (Rz up to 180 µm). The contamination layer demonstrates high laser absorption (α = 0.92 at 1064 nm) due to embedded soot particles, contrasting with the underlying mortar's moderate reflectivity (R = 0.15). The calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) matrix shows compromised integrity with microcracking (2-8 µm width) along portlandite (Ca(OH)₂) crystal boundaries. EDX analysis confirms 18.7 at% sulfur penetration to 80 µm depth through the 15% porous network. Thermal analysis indicates the contamination layer's ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) is significantly lower than the mortar substrate (1.2 J/cm²), creating preferential removal conditions.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 1.5 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving the C-S-H matrix integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 12.8 µm with 95% sulfur reduction confirmed by XPS analysis. Profilometry shows exposed aggregate surfaces with minimal damage (<5 µm ablation depth). The treated surface maintains original compressive strength (25 MPa) with no thermal degradation of calcium silicate hydrate phases. AFM measurements reveal nanoscale surface morphology with 45 nm RMS roughness on cementitious regions. Optical microscopy confirms preservation of the original pore structure (15% porosity) with complete removal of gypsum crystallization. Process optimization achieved 98% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining substrate temperature below 350°C, preventing β-to-γ-C₂S phase transformation. SEM analysis shows intact ettringite needles and unaltered portlandite crystallites.
