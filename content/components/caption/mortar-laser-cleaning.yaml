# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mortar masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The mortar exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The mortar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural soundness.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
