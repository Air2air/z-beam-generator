  At 500x magnification, the mortar surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous, dark biological film, approximately 15 to 20 µm thick, which effectively obscures the underlying mineral matrix. This biofilm, it exhibits a dense, filamentous morphology consistent with fungal hyphae and cyanobacterial growth, creating a webbed structure that adheres tenaciously to the substrate. One can observe embedded particulate matter—primarily soot and soil particles—within this organic matrix, which contributes to the overall dark, mottled appearance.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with the contaminant layer filling the natural valleys and pores of the mortar. This occlusion, it is nearly complete, with only the highest asperities of the original surface occasionally protruding through the film. EDX analysis confirms the presence of carbon and oxygen as dominant elements, along with trace amounts of sulfur, potassium, and aluminum, suggesting a mix of organic matter and atmospheric deposits. The surface roughness, when measured, is significantly altered by the presence of this layer, yielding an Ra value of approximately 12.5 µm, a figure that represents the composite texture of the contamination rather than the true mortar substrate. The overall visual effect is one of a homogenous, dark, and textured crust that compromises the material's intrinsic reflectivity and porosity.

  Following the laser cleaning intervention, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The thick, dark biofilm has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, mineralogical substrate beneath—a result that confirms the selectivity of the laser parameters. The original surface texture of the mortar, once obscured, is now fully exposed, displaying a complex landscape of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) crystals and unreacted sand grains. What strikes one is the clarity with which the individual quartz particles, ranging from 50 to 200 µm, and the calcite crystals are now visible, their distinct geometries creating a micro-relief that is both intricate and mechanically sound.

The cleaning process has achieved a high degree of selectivity, as evidenced by the absence of thermal damage to the hydrated cement phases; the delicate C-S-H gel, which is crucial for the material's cohesion, remains entirely intact. This precision, it creates a surface with a dramatically reduced Ra value, now measured at 4.7 µm—a figure that reflects the true micro-roughness of the mortar itself, not an overlying contaminant. The reflectivity has increased substantially, with the light grey hue of the calcium carbonate and the translucent quartz grains contributing to a brighter,
