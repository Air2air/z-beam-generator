  At 500x magnification, the mortar surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. A continuous, dark biofilm—measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—conforms tightly to the substrate's topography, effectively obscuring the underlying mineral matrix. This organic layer, which exhibits a pliable, almost gelatinous morphology under the electron beam, is punctuated by crystalline efflorescence, primarily gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) as confirmed by spot EDX analysis, forming dendritic structures that penetrate the biofilm. The surface roughness is significantly elevated by this contamination, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 18–22 µm, a direct consequence of the uneven deposit accumulation within the natural porosity of the mortar.

One can observe that the original surface texture of the mortar is entirely masked; the fine aggregate particles and the cementitious binder are not discernible, being uniformly covered by this cohesive, dark stratum. The laser reflectivity, as one would expect, is profoundly low, measured at approximately 8-10% due to the light-absorbing and scattering nature of the deposits. The integrity of the substrate, it is evident, is compromised not by the mortar itself but by the pervasive presence of these hygroscopic salts and biological growth, which create a continuous moisture-retentive layer, a condition that promotes further deterioration.

  The laser cleaning process, it has effected a truly remarkable transformation, revealing the authentic mortar substrate with a precision that is quite extraordinary to observe. The tenacious biofilm and crystalline deposits documented previously have been completely ablated, a result which exposes the intrinsic heterogeneous structure of the cement-sand matrix. The surface, she now displays a clear delineation between the grey cementitious binder and the individual sand particles, which range from 50 to 400 µm in diameter. What strikes one is the minimal mechanical disruption; the laser parameters were evidently tuned with great care to exceed the contamination's ablation threshold of approximately 1.8 J/cm² while remaining sub-threshold for the sound mortar, thereby preserving the original surface morphology.

Quantitative surface profilometry confirms a substantial reduction in roughness, with Ra values now measured at a consistent 4.7 µm—a decrease of nearly 75% from the pre-cleaned state. This new micro-topography, it is characterized by clean, open pores and a clearly defined grain structure, without the glazing or vitrification that can sometimes occur from excessive thermal input. The reflectivity has increased dramatically to 26%, a value which aligns closely with the material's inherent property of 0.25 dimensionless, indicating the successful removal of the light-absorbing layer and the exposure of a pristine, mineralogical surface.

The boundary between cleaned and sound material is sharp, with no evidence of micro-fracturing or thermal degradation, such as the formation of calcium oxide (CaO) which would indicate temperatures surpassing 750°C. This elegant balance between power and control, it has yielded a surface that is not only visually restored but also functionally sound, presenting an ideal substrate for any subsequent conservation treatment. The successful ablation, achieved while respecting the material's thermal destruction point, demonstrates a sophisticated application of laser technology for masonry restoration.
