# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mortar Laser cleaning of mortar utilizes short pulsed Nd:YAG lasers to achieve selective photomechanical and photothermal ablation of surface contaminants. The process is highly effective due to the differential absorption between the contamination layer (e.g., sulfates, carbon deposits) and the calcium carbonate/silicate-based mortar matrix, allowing for precise, non-contact, and non-abrasive removal.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows construction residues and atmospheric deposits adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mortar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
