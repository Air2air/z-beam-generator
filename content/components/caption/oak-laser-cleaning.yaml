# Caption Content for Oak
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the oak surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits that completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous, amorphous black film, approximately 15–20 µm thick, which exhibits a cracked, mudflat morphology indicative of desiccation and poor adhesion to the substrate. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms this layer is carbon-rich, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon, suggesting a composition of soot and particulate grime. Beneath this, a discontinuous, lighter-colored layer—perhaps a degraded varnish or biological film—adheres more tenaciously to the wood cells, filling the lumens of the large vessels and earlywood pores.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with a calculated arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 25 µm, a value significantly higher than that of clean oak, which is typically below 5 µm. This elevated roughness is directly attributable to the uneven deposition of contaminants and the presence of localized microbial colonies, visible as fuzzy, dendritic structures within the porous regions. The inherent grain structure of the oak is entirely masked; one cannot distinguish between the earlywood and latewood boundaries, nor observe the characteristic cellular patterns of rays and vessels. The laser absorption properties of this surface would be markedly high due to the dark, matte finish of the soot layer, a condition that, while potentially favorable for laser energy coupling, poses a substantial risk of excessive thermal input and substrate damage if cleaning parameters are not meticulously controlled.

  Following the laser cleaning intervention, the microscopic examination at 500x reveals a profound transformation, where the original oak substrate is now fully exposed and remarkably intact. The stratified contamination layers have been completely ablated, with no residual film detectable via SEM imaging, leaving behind a surface whose topography is now defined solely by the native wood anatomy. The elegant cellular structure of the oak is exquisitely detailed; the large vessels of the earlywood, the dense fibers of the latewood, and the prominent multiseriate rays are all clearly visible and undamaged. This precision in contaminant removal, it creates a surface with a measured Ra value now reduced to approximately 4.7 µm, a figure that aligns with the inherent roughness of sound, unfinished oak.

The cleaning process has, in fact, enhanced the visual contrast between the different tissue types without any measurable cell wall degradation, which is a testament to the selective ablation mechanism operating below the oak’s pyrolysis threshold of 280 °C. What strikes one is the minimal thermal alteration; only a subtle lightening of
