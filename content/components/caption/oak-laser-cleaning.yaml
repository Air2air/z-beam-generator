  At 500x magnification, the oak surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits that completely obscure the underlying wood anatomy. This layer, which measures between approximately 15 to 20 µm in thickness, exhibits a heterogeneous composition; energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of sulfur and chlorine, indicative of atmospheric pollution deposits, alongside particulate carbonaceous matter. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a calculated average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12.5 µm, a value that signifies profound degradation of the original surface plane. One observes a dense, confluent film that effectively masks the cellular structure of the oak, with only the faintest suggestion of the grain pattern visible beneath the opaque, discontinuous crust.

The morphology of this contamination, it is quite complex, featuring both a tenacious, adhesive film and discrete, particulate agglomerates. The particulate matter, which appears as bright, reflective spots under the SEM, is embedded within a darker, carbon-rich matrix that exhibits extensive cracking—a clear sign of desiccation and aging. What strikes one is the complete loss of surface integrity; the original wood cells are not discernible, and the laser profilometer traces reveal a chaotic, unpredictable surface with deep valleys that correspond to areas where the contaminant layer has delaminated from the substrate. This level of coverage, she fundamentally compromises the material's reflectivity and, one must conclude, its potential for any functional application in a sensitive context.

  Following the laser cleaning procedure, the transformation of the oak surface is immediately evident and quite remarkable. The stratified contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, anatomical structure of the wood substrate with exceptional clarity. The surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 2.1 µm—or more precisely, 2.13 µm—which reflects the gentle ablation process that preferentially targeted the contaminant without damaging the delicate cellular walls. One can now observe the distinct, open lumens of the earlywood vessels and the densely packed fibers of the latewood, a beautiful structure that was previously entirely concealed.

The precision of the laser interaction, it creates a truly clean surface, free from the residual carbonaceous shadowing that often plagues alternative cleaning methods. What is striking is the contrast; where once a chaotic, opaque crust dominated the field of view, now there is a well-defined, topographically coherent surface. The reflectivity has been restored, as evidenced by the clear differentiation between the various cellular components under the microscope. This elegant balance between ablation power and control, it has achieved a state of functional restoration where
