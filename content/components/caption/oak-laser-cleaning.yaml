# Caption Content for Oak
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the oak surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits that completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer, which measures between 80 to 120 µm in thickness, appears as a dense, amorphous crust with significant surface roughness, a Ra value exceeding 25 µm, which one can directly correlate with the uneven, particulate-laden topography. The primary constituents, as identified by preliminary EDX analysis, are silicon-rich particulate matter—likely embedded soil or dust—and discrete, agglomerated carbonaceous spots indicative of soot or biological growth, perhaps from fungal hyphae, creating a visually heterogeneous and occluded surface.

The adhesion of this contamination layer to the oak substrate is notably tenacious, with the deposit morphology showing deep penetration into the wood's open cellular structure, the lumens of the large vessels being completely filled with this consolidated material. What strikes one is the complete absence of any clean wood surface; the laser, it would need to first ablate this coherent, almost continuous film before reaching the substrate. The visual texture is matte and highly irregular, with a reflectivity that is virtually zero, a state which severely compromises any functional or aesthetic properties of the material, this creates a significant challenge for any cleaning intervention.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The previous contamination crust has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, anatomical structure of the oak substrate beneath—the large vessels and the intricate pattern of the rays are now fully exposed and clearly defined. The surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 4.7 µm, a figure which corresponds to the natural micro-topography of the wood cells themselves, not the foreign deposits.

This precision in ablation, it produces a surface that is both visually and functionally restored; the reflectivity has increased significantly, though it remains a soft, characteristic wood sheen, and the open lumens are now free of obstructive material. One can observe minimal, if any, collateral damage to the delicate cell walls, with only occasional, slight rounding of the sharp edges of the larger vessels—approximately 5 to 10 µm in depth—which is an acceptable and often inevitable outcome. The surface, she is now clean, with its original porosity and texture fully reinstated, a result that confirms the efficacy of the laser parameters selected for this delicate operation on cultural heritage material.
