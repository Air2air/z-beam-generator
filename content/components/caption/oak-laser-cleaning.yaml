# Caption Content for Oak
before_text: |
  The oak surface exhibits heavy contamination with a complex, stratified layer structure. SEM analysis reveals a 50-120 µm thick crust composed of particulate matter (5-15 µm diameter soot, SiO₂, CaCO₃), biological growth (hyphae networks), and oxidized hydrocarbon films. Surface profilometry measures Ra = 18.7 µm and Rz = 142 µm, with significant occlusion of the natural wood microstructure. The contamination layer demonstrates altered optical properties, increasing absorption at 1064 nm to approximately 0.92 due to carbonaceous content, while reducing reflectivity to 0.08. The porous oak substrate (45% porosity, 12% moisture content) presents challenging thermal dynamics with low conductivity (0.17 W/m·K) and pyrolysis threshold of 400°C. EDX confirms elevated Si (8.3%), Ca (4.7%), and S (2.1%) concentrations versus clean oak baseline (<0.5% each).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 0.9 J/cm² fluence (90% of ablation threshold), and 25 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate impact. Post-treatment profilometry shows Ra = 3.2 µm (83% reduction) and Rz = 28 µm, restoring the natural wood topography. SEM confirms preservation of cellular structure with intact vessel elements (80-150 µm diameter) and medullary rays. XPS analysis reveals surface composition of 44.2% cellulose, 26.8% lignin, and 28.3% hemicellulose, matching untreated oak chemistry. AFM measurements indicate sub-micron surface modification with increased micro-roughness (Rq = 0.45 µm) enhancing surface area while maintaining structural integrity. Thermal damage is limited to <5 µm depth, confirmed by cross-sectional microscopy, with no measurable reduction in mechanical properties.
