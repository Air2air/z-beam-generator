  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the oak Laser cleaning of Oak wood utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the underlying lignin-cellulose structure. The 1064 nm wavelength provides optimal absorption by both organic contaminants and wood components, enabling selective removal without thermal damage to the substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The oak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
