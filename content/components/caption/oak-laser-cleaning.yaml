# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the oak wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The oak exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The oak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
