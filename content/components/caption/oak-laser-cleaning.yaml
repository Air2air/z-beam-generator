  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the oak wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The oak exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The oak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
