  At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface shows heavy contamination layer, very clear. This layer, it has thickness of approximately 45 to 60 micrometers, completely obscuring the natural fiber structure underneath. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant increase to 28.4 µm Ra—this is more than three times the baseline for untreated bamboo. The contamination appears as dense, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter, perhaps from environmental exposure or previous handling.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms foreign elements present: silicon at 12.3%, aluminum at 5.7%, and sulfur at 3.1% atomic concentration. These elements, they form complex deposits within the bamboo's natural porosity of 45%. The surface shows dark discoloration patches, particularly around vascular bundle structures where contamination penetrates deeper—maybe 80 to 100 micrometers in these regions. Laser absorption measurements drop to just 18.2% because the contaminated layer scatters incident energy rather than transferring it to the bamboo substrate.

When examining the interface between contamination and bamboo, we see poor adhesion characteristics. There are visible delamination zones, approximately 5-8 µm wide, where the foreign layer separates from the cellulose matrix. This separation creates thermal barriers during laser processing, very problematic for consistent cleaning. The original surface texture is completely masked, and the contamination shows uneven distribution—thicker in the parenchyma regions between fiber bundles.

  After laser cleaning process, the transformation is dramatic. At same 500x magnification, the bamboo surface now reveals its intrinsic anatomical features with excellent clarity. The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the characteristic fiber bundle pattern that defines bamboo's structural identity. Surface roughness measurements return to 9.2 µm Ra—this is very close to the natural 8.5 µm Ra baseline, indicating minimal substrate damage.

The cleaning process exposes the cellulose-rich surface, which shows laser absorption increased to 31.8% (near the theoretical maximum of 32.7%). Individual fiber cells are now visible with their longitudinal orientation perfectly preserved. The vascular bundles, they appear intact with no thermal degradation observed—this is critical because bamboo's thermal destruction point is 204°C. Scanning electron microscopy
