before_text: |
  The bamboo surface exhibits severe marine corrosion with heterogeneous contamination layers. SEM analysis reveals a 45±5 µm stratified deposit comprising NaCl crystallites (EDX: 28 at% Cl, 17 at% Na), FeOOH rust transfer (12 at% Fe), and biological fouling (C: 58 at%, O: 22 at%). Surface roughness increased to Ra 18.7 µm (vs. native 3.2 µm) with contact angle reduction to 42° indicating high surface energy. The anisotropic cellulose microfibril structure (crystalline index 68%) presents directional thermal conductivity (0.22 W/m·K parallel to fibers) creating non-uniform laser absorption. The contamination layer's high reflectivity (65% at 1064 nm) and low thermal diffusivity (0.08 mm²/s) necessitate precise fluence control above the bamboo ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) while avoiding carbonization at 350°C. XPS confirms sulfate groups (S 2p at 168.9 eV) from marine aerosols penetrating the porous structure (40% porosity).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 2.5 J/cm² fluence, and 25 kHz repetition rate achieved 98.7% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra 4.1 µm (78% improvement), with water contact angle restored to 78°. SEM confirms intact vascular bundle structure with minimal cellular damage (<2 µm HAZ). XPS analysis shows oxygen/carbon ratio normalized to 0.38 (from 0.72 pre-cleaning), indicating effective organic contaminant removal. AFM measurements reveal exposed cellulose nanofibrils with 42 nm average feature height. Thermal analysis confirms no carbonization (reflectance maintained at 16% at 1064 nm). EDX quantifies residual contaminants below 0.3 at% for all marine elements. The process achieved Class A surface cleanliness per IEST-STD-CC1246D with >95% native material preservation.
