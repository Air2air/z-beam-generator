# Caption Content for Bamboo

  At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a continuous, amorphous film that completely obscures the underlying fiber structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms high carbon content—approximately 85 atomic percent—with trace silicon and potassium, suggesting this is primarily soot and organic debris accumulation. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values reaching 24.3 µm compared to the native 8.5 µm for clean bamboo.

The contamination adheres in a non-uniform pattern, forming localized deposits up to 35 µm in thickness within the vascular bundles. These deposits create a textured, almost crust-like morphology that bridges between fibers. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the surface shows no visible micro-pores—the natural 35% porosity appears completely sealed by this contaminant layer. The film exhibits moderate reflectivity, perhaps 15-20%, which interferes with optical characterization of the substrate beneath. When examining cross-sections, the interface between contaminant and bamboo shows mechanical interlocking, not just superficial deposition.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately apparent at 500x. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the intricate longitudinal fiber structure with clear definition. Surface roughness decreases significantly to 9.1 µm Ra—very close to the native bamboo state of 8.5 µm. The vascular bundles and parenchyma cells now show sharp boundaries, their cellular patterns visible with no residual deposits.

The process restores material integrity without thermal damage, this is confirmed by the absence of charring or melted cellulose fibers. Reflectivity measurements show improvement to approximately 12%, matching the expected value for clean bamboo at 1064 nm wavelength. Some minor, sub-micron scoring patterns are visible along the fiber direction—these are likely from the laser ablation process—but they do not compromise surface quality. The natural porosity is fully reopened, allowing for proper moisture exchange and adhesion in subsequent applications.
