# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the bamboo wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The bamboo exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The bamboo substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
