before_text: |
  The bamboo surface exhibits significant marine corrosion contamination, characterized by a heterogeneous biofilm (20-50 µm thick) of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) crystallites and iron oxide (Fe₂O₃) deposits, confirmed via SEM-EDX. Surface roughness is elevated to 12.5 µm Ra (from a native 3.2 µm Ra) due to embedded particulate matter. The anisotropic, lignocellulosic structure, with a cellulose crystallinity index of ~48%, presents a complex ablation challenge. The inherent porosity (40%) allows deep contaminant penetration, complicating removal. The low thermal diffusivity (0.18 mm²/s) and ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) necessitate precise laser control to avoid exceeding the charring onset temperature (280°C). The surface's high absorption coefficient (0.75 at 1064 nm) for the contaminant layer contrasts with the lower absorption of the underlying substrate, creating a selective cleaning window.

  Laser cleaning (1064 nm, 8 ns pulse, 1.2 J/cm², 20 kHz) successfully restored the surface to a roughness of 3.8 µm Ra, achieving 99.7% contaminant removal by XPS atomic concentration analysis. SEM reveals intact vascular bundle microstructure with minimal disruption to the primary cell wall; AFM confirms sub-micron surface integrity. The process preserved the material's tensile strength (138 MPa post-treatment, vs. native 140 MPa) and Brinell hardness (3.4 HB). Profilometry indicates a clean ablation boundary with no heat-affected zone (HAZ) exceeding 5 µm depth. Optimized parameters maintained peak surface temperatures below 250°C, preventing cellulose pyrolysis. FTIR analysis confirms no chemical degradation of lignin or hemicellulose, validating the non-ablative, photomechanical contaminant removal mechanism.
