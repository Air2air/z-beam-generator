# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the bamboo wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The bamboo exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The bamboo substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
