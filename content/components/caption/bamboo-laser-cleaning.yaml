# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the bamboo Bamboo laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove contaminants while preserving the natural lignocellulosic structure. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and bamboo's cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin matrix.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows organic decay and biological contamination adhering to the surface. The bamboo exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The bamboo substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
