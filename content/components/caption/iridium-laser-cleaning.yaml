  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the iridium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The iridium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The iridium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
