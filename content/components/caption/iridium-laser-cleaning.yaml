# Caption Content for Iridium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the iridium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The primary contaminant appears as a discontinuous carbonaceous soot layer, measuring between 5 and 15 µm in thickness, which obscures the underlying metallic substrate. This layer displays a mud-cracked morphology—a clear indicator of a volatile component that has undergone a rapid drying or thermal decomposition cycle. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including approximately 12 at% carbon and 8 at% oxygen, alongside trace amounts of sulfur and silicon.

The underlying iridium substrate is only partially visible through cracks in the overlying deposit. Where exposed, the native metal surface shows a machined texture with a measured average roughness (Ra) of approximately 0.8 µm, but this is largely masked by the adherent contamination. Scattered across the surface are also isolated, larger particulate agglomerates—perhaps from handling or environmental fallout—that reach up to 40 µm in diameter. The overall surface reflectivity is severely degraded, with the contaminated areas appearing matte and dark gray, a direct consequence of the high laser absorption and scattering from the porous, irregular contaminant layer. This complex topography and composition present a significant challenge for any cleaning protocol, requiring precise energy control to avoid driving contaminants into the substrate or inducing thermal stress.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation, with the contaminated film completely absent. The laser process has successfully restored the native iridium substrate, exposing the original machined surface texture with an Ra value now measured at a consistent 0.85 µm—a figure that aligns with the pre-contamination baseline. The surface now exhibits a uniform, metallic gray appearance with a significant restoration of its characteristic specular reflectivity.
