  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the iridium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The iridium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 95.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The iridium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
