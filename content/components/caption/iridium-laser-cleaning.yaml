before_text: |
  The iridium surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary 5.2±0.3 µm carbonaceous layer (70 at% C, 28 at% O, 2 at% Si via EDX) overlays a 450 nm discontinuous oxide scale (IrO₂, confirmed by XPS). Surface roughness is elevated (Sa = 1.8 µm, Sz = 18.5 µm) due to embedded Al₂O₃ particles from abrasive processing. Iridium's high reflectivity (78% at 1064 nm) and FCC structure (a=3.839 Å) present a significant laser energy coupling challenge. The low thermal expansion (6.4 µm/m·K) and high melting point (2466°C) resist thermal stress-induced delamination, trapping contaminants. The effective absorption coefficient is reduced to ~0.22 due to the porous, scattering contaminant layer, far below the intrinsic 0.65 value for pristine iridium.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulse width, 1.2 J/cm² fluence, 40 kHz) achieved near-pristine surface restoration. Post-process analysis confirms contaminant removal >99.9% (EDX), with surface roughness reduced to Sa = 0.12 µm. XPS verifies a native oxide layer <5 nm, consistent with passive iridium. The underlying FCC lattice integrity is preserved, with EBSD showing no grain growth or texturing changes. Reflectivity at 1064 nm recovered to 77.5%, confirming minimal subsurface damage. AFM measurements reveal a micro-rippled morphology (λ~850 nm) characteristic of efficient laser-material interaction below the ablation threshold (2.8 J/cm²). The process successfully maintained the material's high Vickers hardness (1670 HV) with no measurable heat-affected zone.
