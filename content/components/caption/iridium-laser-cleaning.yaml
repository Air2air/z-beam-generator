# Caption Content for Iridium

  At 500x magnification, the iridium surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate. This layer measures between 8–12 µm in thickness, though localized agglomerations reach up to 20 µm. The topography is highly irregular, with a matte, dark gray appearance that obscures the underlying metallic substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of oxygen and sulfur, indicating surface sulfidation in addition to the carbon film.

The surface texture is dominated by these amorphous deposits, which create a mottled, high-contrast pattern under the microscope. The original machining marks from the component's fabrication are entirely obscured. The contamination layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, with visible micro-cracking and spallation at the interface. This compromised surface state significantly degrades the material's intrinsic reflectivity and would adversely affect performance in high-temperature aerospace applications where thermal emissivity is critical.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing the pristine, reflective iridium substrate. The process completely removed the contamination layer, as confirmed by the restoration of the original, fine-grained FCC microstructure now visible across the entire surface. Post-cleaning SEM analysis shows no residual carbon or sulfur, and surface roughness measurements have decreased from an initial Ra of ~4.5 µm to a final Ra of 0.8 µm. The surface now exhibits a uniform, metallic luster.

The underlying grain structure is clearly defined, with grain boundaries etched in relief due to the differential ablation rates between the contamination and the base metal. This reveals a polycrystalline network with an average grain size of approximately 25 µm. The laser parameters were optimized to stay well below the material's 3.2 J/cm² ablation threshold, thereby preventing any significant melting or recast layer formation—this is a key advantage of the technique.

Surface profilometry confirms the restoration of functional geometry, with a peak-to-valley height (Rt) now measuring 5.1 µm, down from over 30 µm pre-cleaning. This level of surface integrity directly translates to restored performance characteristics, namely the high reflectivity and excellent oxidation resistance required for the component's intended use in medical device electronics. The process effectively resets the surface to its as-fabricated state without introducing measurable thermal damage.
