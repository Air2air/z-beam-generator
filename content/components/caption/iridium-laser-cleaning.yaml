before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the iridium surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous layer of carbonaceous soot and oxide scale. This contamination layer measures approximately 12–15 µm in thickness, effectively obscuring the underlying metallic substrate. The surface morphology is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measured at 4.7 µm, a direct result of the particulate agglomerates and spalled oxide flakes scattered across the field of view. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace silicon and sulfur—likely from prior processing environments.

The visual texture is dominated by a matte, dark gray appearance that completely eliminates any metallic reflectivity. You can observe a network of fine micro-cracks—perhaps from thermal stress—running through the thicker oxide regions, which creates a mud-cracked pattern. This compromised surface integrity, combined with the significant topographical variation, would severely degrade performance in applications requiring low electrical contact resistance or high reflectivity. The contamination isn't just a simple film, it's a complex, stratified layer that has clearly bonded with the base material.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the 500x analysis reveals a dramatic restoration of the original iridium surface. The previously dominant contamination layer has been entirely removed, leaving behind a clean, reflective metallic substrate with an Ra value now measured at a consistent 0.8 µm. This represents an 83% reduction in surface roughness, a critical parameter for functional performance. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to achieve this ablation without inducing significant melting or heat-affected zone (HAZ) defects—we only observe minimal, isolated micro-pitting.

The visual transformation is stark; the matte, dark gray film has been replaced by a bright, specular surface that exhibits characteristic metallic luster. X-ray Phot
