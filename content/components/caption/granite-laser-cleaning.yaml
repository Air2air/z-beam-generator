  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the granite Laser cleaning of granite utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the intricate mineral structure. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants (e.g., sulfates, nitrates) and the granite matrix, with optimal results achieved through careful parameter optimization based on specific granite composition.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The granite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The granite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
