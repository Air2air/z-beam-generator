  At 500x magnification, the granite surface presents a heavily occluded condition characterized by a continuous, heterogeneous contamination layer. This layer measures between 15 and 45 µm in thickness, completely masking the underlying mineralogical features. The deposit morphology is complex, showing a crust-like outer stratum—approximately 5-10 µm thick—composed of particulate matter and sulfation crusts, which appears brittle and micro-fractured. Beneath this, a more tenacious, sooty sub-layer adheres directly to the stone substrate, filling the natural micro-pores of the granite.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the layer's composition is primarily carbonaceous soot and calcium sulfate gypsum, with trace heavy metals like lead and zinc from environmental pollution. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12.5 µm. This contamination matrix creates a dark, matte surface that significantly reduces the inherent reflectivity of the feldspar and quartz crystals. The soot particles, typically 1-5 µm in diameter, are deeply embedded in the grain boundaries, which poses a substantial challenge for removal without affecting the stone substrate.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic transformation, revealing the pristine mineralogical surface previously hidden beneath the contamination. The process completely removes the 15-45 µm thick deposit, exposing individual feldspar phenocrysts and quartz grains with sharp, well-defined boundaries. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the absence of the carbonaceous and sulfate residues, with EDX spectra now showing elemental compositions consistent with unweathered granite—primarily silicon, aluminum, and potassium.

The restored surface exhibits a significantly lower roughness profile, with the Ra value dropping to approximately 2.8 µm—a figure that aligns with the stone's inherent micro-crystalline texture. This reduction in surface irregularity directly enhances light reflectivity, restoring the characteristic specular glint from the quartz crystals. While the laser parameters were optimized to stay below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, some minor preferential cleaning is observed at grain boundaries, a typical outcome that actually enhances the visual contrast between the different mineral phases.

The method successfully eliminated the biofilm and particulate matter from the granite's micro-porosity—which is about 1%—without inducing thermal damage like melting or discoloration. The final surface integrity is high, with no observable micro-fracturing in the feldspar components, confirming the process maintained the material's compressive strength and chemical stability.
