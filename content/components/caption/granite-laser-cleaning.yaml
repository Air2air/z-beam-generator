# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the granite stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The granite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The granite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
