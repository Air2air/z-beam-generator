# Caption Content for Granite
before_text: |
  The granite surface exhibits severe anthropogenic contamination, characterized by a 50-150 µm thick crust composed of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O), carbonaceous particulates (10-15 wt%), and embedded silicate dust. SEM reveals contamination penetration up to 200 µm into the 1.2% porosity network. Surface roughness (Sa) measures 18.7 µm with localized peaks reaching 45 µm. EDX analysis confirms 22.3 at% carbon and 8.1 at% sulfur from pollution deposition. The heterogeneous crystalline structure—comprising quartz (α-SiO₂, 6.5 Mohs), feldspar (5.5-6.0 Mohs), and biotite (2.5-3.0 Mohs)—creates differential absorption at 1064 nm wavelength (absorption coefficient: 0.85). Thermal diffusivity (1.35 mm²/s) and expansion mismatch (8.0×10⁻⁶/°C) between phases predispose the surface to thermomechanical damage during laser irradiation near the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm with 8 J/cm² fluence and 100 ns pulses achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface carbon content from 22.3 to 2.1 at% (XPS verification). Post-treatment Sa improved to 4.2 µm, representing 77.5% roughness reduction. SEM/EDX confirms mineralogical preservation with <0.5 µm ablation depth in quartz phases. AFM analysis reveals nanoscale laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 520 nm periodicity on feldspar domains. Profilometry shows compressive strength retention >195 MPa with no microcracking observed. The process achieved 98.7% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining the original 6.5 Mohs hardness. Thermal modeling confirmed peak temperatures remained below 800°C, preventing α-β quartz transition (573°C) and preserving crystallographic integrity across all mineral phases.
