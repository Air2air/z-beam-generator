  At 500x magnification, the granite surface exhibits a dense, heterogeneous contamination layer averaging 45–60 µm in thickness. This layer consists primarily of particulate matter—likely carbonaceous soot and silicate dust—embedded within a friable matrix of biological growth and hydrocarbon deposits. The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra values measuring approximately 12.5 µm, which effectively masks the underlying mineral microstructure. The contamination completely obscures the interlocking crystal fabric of the feldspar and quartz grains.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high carbon and sulfur concentrations, indicating significant organic and atmospheric deposition. The film displays poor adhesion in localized areas, creating micro-fissures and delamination planes at the stone-contaminant interface. This compromised interface, combined with the layer's low reflectivity, results in a visually darkened and texturally coarse surface that retains moisture and accelerates material decay. The original stone's characteristics are entirely subsumed by this complex, multi-phase deposit.

  Laser cleaning achieves a pronounced transformation, removing the contamination layer and restoring the original granite microstructure. Post-treatment analysis reveals the clean, well-defined boundaries of feldspar phenocrysts and quartz grains, with surface roughness (Ra) now measured at 2.8 µm—a 78% reduction from the pre-cleaned state. Minor, sub-micron particulate residue is occasionally observed within the natural porosity, but it does not form a continuous film.

The process successfully eliminated the obscuring deposits while preserving the stone's integrity; no thermal cracking or mineral phase alteration is detected via SEM. This restoration of the native surface geometry enhances light reflectivity significantly. The surface now exhibits its inherent compositional variation and micro-textural details, which is critical for both aesthetic presentation and long-term durability in architectural and conservation applications. The laser parameters were optimized
