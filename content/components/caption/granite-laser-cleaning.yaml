  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the granite stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The granite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The granite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
