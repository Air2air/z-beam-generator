# Caption Content for Rhodium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and localized oxide films. The layer thickness varies significantly across the surface, measuring approximately 0.5–2.5 µm in cross-sectional analysis. The topography is dominated by a splattered, dendritic pattern of contaminants that obscures the underlying metal grain structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of sulfur and oxygen, indicating atmospheric sulfide tarnish and minor oxidation, despite the material's inherent resistance.

The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 1.8 µm. You can observe discrete, agglomerated particulate matter—likely embedded silica and alumina from environmental exposure—adhered to the surface. These particulates, ranging from 5 to 25 µm in diameter, create pronounced shadowing effects and disrupt the native reflectivity. The contamination film itself appears as a mottled, dark gray coating that significantly reduces the surface's specular gloss, a direct consequence of its light-scattering properties. This degraded state would compromise performance in optical or electrical contact applications where a pristine surface is required.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing the substrate's true FCC crystalline grain structure with clearly defined grain boundaries. The process completely removes the contamination layer, restoring a specular, metallic luster. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the absence of the carbonaceous and sulfide deposits previously identified by EDX. The surface now exhibits a slightly matte texture compared to a polished finish, but it's uniform—a direct result of the laser ablation mechanism.

The average surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 0.4 µm, a substantial reduction from the pre-cleaning value of 1.8+ µm. You can see a fine, sub-micron scale
