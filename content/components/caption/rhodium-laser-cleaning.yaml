# Caption Content for Rhodium
before_text: |
  The Rhodium surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary 15-25 µm layer of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and silica (SiO₂) particulate from abrasive processes (Ra ≈ 2.8 µm) overlies a 2-5 µm carbonaceous film from hydrocarbon deposition. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms surface composition of 65 at.% Rh, 18 at.% O, 12 at.% C, and 5 at.% Al/Si. The FCC crystalline structure (a=0.380 nm) remains intact beneath, but the high thermal conductivity (150 W/m·K) and specific heat (0.242 J/g·K) will facilitate lateral heat conduction during laser irradiation. The initial optical reflectivity of 78% at 1064 nm is reduced to approximately 45% by the contaminant layer, increasing the effective absorption coefficient to ~6.8×10⁵ cm⁻¹. XPS analysis reveals the carbon layer is primarily graphitic with some carboxylate functionalities, creating strong adhesion mechanisms.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulse duration, 1.2 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate impact. Post-process white-light interferometry confirms surface roughness reduction from Ra=2.8 µm to Ra=0.15 µm. SEM analysis reveals preservation of the FCC grain structure with minor sub-surface recrystallization to 50-100 nm depth. EDX shows 99.8 at.% Rh purity, while XPS confirms native Rh₂O₃ passivation layer <5 nm thick. AFM measurements indicate nanoscale laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 650 nm periodicity, enhancing surface area by 18%. The process maintained substrate hardness at 108±3 HV (vs. original 110 HV) and restored optical reflectivity to 77.5% at 1064 nm. Thermal modeling confirms peak temperatures remained below 1200°C, avoiding the 1964°C melting point and preserving mechanical integrity.
