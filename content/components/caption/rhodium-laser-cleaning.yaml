  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the rhodium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The rhodium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The rhodium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
