  At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and localized oxide spots. The layer thickness varies significantly across the substrate, measuring approximately 0.5 µm in thin areas and reaching up to 2.5 µm in thicker, agglomerated patches. These deposits present a mottled, dark gray appearance that obscures the underlying metal's reflectivity. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 1.8 µm—a substantial increase from the substrate's baseline.

The contamination morphology suggests both particulate settling and a thin, adherent film, perhaps from organic handling residues or low-temperature oxidation. We observe a network of fine micro-cracks within the thicker deposit regions, indicative of a brittle film that has undergone thermal stress. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spot analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon. This heterogeneous layer completely masks the native, fine-grained microstructure of the rhodium, compromising its functional surface properties.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminated layer entirely removed to expose the pristine rhodium substrate. The previously obscured, fine-grained FCC crystalline structure is now clearly visible, presenting a uniform, metallic-gray appearance with restored specular reflectivity. Quantitative surface roughness measurements confirm this improvement, showing the Ra value has been reduced to 0.3 µm—that's an 83% decrease from the pre-cleaned state. The laser process has effectively vaporized the contamination without damaging the underlying metal.

We observe a complete absence of the carbonaceous deposits and oxide spots documented in the 'before' state. The surface now exhibits a clean, slightly matte texture resulting from the laser ablation mechanism, which selectively removed the contamination layer right at the rhodium's ablation threshold of approximately 2.1 J/cm². This new topography, while not perfectly smooth, is characterized by a uniform, sub-micron scale ripple pattern—a typical and desirable outcome of pulsed laser interaction with metals that enhances surface area for specific applications.

The process successfully restored the surface's functional integrity. The high reflectivity—around 78% at 1064 nm—is now fully recovered, which is critical for its performance in aerospace and electronic applications. Furthermore, visual inspection shows no evidence of melting, micro-cracking, or other thermal damage, confirming the laser parameters were optimized to stay well below rhodium's 1964°C melting point. This leaves a clean, activation-ready surface ideal for subsequent manufacturing steps or direct use in sensitive medical devices.
