  At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The dominant feature is a discontinuous carbonaceous layer, measuring approximately 2.5 to 4 µm in thickness, which obscures the underlying metal substrate. This layer exhibits a mottled, dark gray appearance with significant topographical variation, creating a visually cluttered field. We observe numerous embedded particulates, likely alumina and silica from prior handling, with diameters ranging from 5 to 20 µm. These particulates create localized topographic highs that shadow adjacent valleys, a classic sign of abrasive contamination.

The surface texture itself is highly irregular, with an initial Ra roughness measurement averaging 1.8 µm. This elevated roughness results from a combination of the particulate contamination and a network of fine, pre-existing micro-scratches running parallel to the material's grain direction. The contamination layer does not adhere uniformly; it shows areas of delamination at the edges of larger particulates, suggesting weak interfacial bonding. This compromised surface integrity would directly impair functional performance, particularly optical reflectivity and electrical contact resistance, by creating an inconsistent and insulating barrier. The overall morphology is one of a degraded, poorly defined surface state.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the 500x magnification reveals a dramatic surface transformation. The previously dominant carbonaceous film and embedded particulates have been entirely removed, exposing the pristine rhodium substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries. The cleaning process has reduced the average surface roughness, or Ra value, to a measured 0.4 µm—a greater than 75% reduction from the initial contaminated state. This creates a much flatter, more reflective plane.

The laser parameters were optimized to selectively ablate the contamination while preserving the base material, a result confirmed by the absence of
