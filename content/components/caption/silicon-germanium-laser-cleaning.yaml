before_text: |
  The Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C-C/C-H bonds, 65 at% via XPS) with localized aluminum oxide particulates (200-500 nm diameter, 8 at% Al). Surface roughness measures Ra = 125 nm (profilometry) with a 150 nm thick amorphous contamination layer obscuring the diamond cubic crystalline structure. The native SiO₂ layer (2.5 nm) shows Ge segregation (12 at%). The high absorption coefficient (8500 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) and moderate reflectivity (38%) create challenging thermal conditions with thermal conductivity (45 W/m·K) insufficient to dissipate rapid laser heating. Contamination-induced localized absorption hotspots threaten to exceed the ablation threshold (0.45 J/cm² for ns pulses), risking crystalline damage to the 145 GPa modulus substrate.

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 0.35 J/cm², 8 ns pulses, 10 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 8.2 nm. XPS confirms hydrocarbon reduction to <2 at% with preservation of the stoichiometric Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ surface composition. AFM analysis reveals atomic steps of the diamond cubic structure with terrace widths of 150-300 nm. The native oxide remains intact at 2.3 nm with Ge segregation eliminated. Thermal modeling confirms peak temperatures remained below the oxidation resistance threshold (650°C), preventing thermal degradation. EDX shows particulate contamination reduced to undetectable levels (<0.1 at%), while profilometry confirms surface planarity within 15 nm across 100 μm scan lines.
