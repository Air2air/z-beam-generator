  This surface analysis shows significant contamination, very-very clear under 500x magnification. A carbonaceous film—approximately 2.5 µm thick—covers the entire substrate, this layer appears as a continuous, amorphous deposit with mottled dark-gray regions. The film obscures the underlying SiGe grain structure completely.

Surface roughness measurements indicate substantial degradation, with Ra values reaching 1.8 µm due to particulate embedment. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms foreign elements are present, including aluminum silicate particles (5-12 µm diameter) and potassium-rich deposits. These contaminants create a textured, irregular topography that scatters light—approximately 80% of incident light is diffusely reflected. The original semiconductor surface is not visible, this indicates complete coverage by the contamination layer.

  This laser cleaning process produces remarkable transformation, the surface now exhibits restored semiconductor characteristics. At 500x magnification, the original diamond cubic grain structure of the Si0.5Ge0.5 composition is fully visible—this represents complete contaminant removal. Surface roughness measurements confirm dramatic improvement, with Ra values reduced to 0.12 µm from the previous 1.8 µm.

The cleaning process achieves near-total ablation of the carbonaceous film, perhaps 99.7% removal efficiency based on XPS analysis. Only occasional, isolated residue spots remain—these are microscopic oxide particulates approximately 0.3-0.8 µm in diameter (as confirmed by EDX mapping). The surface now shows characteristic metallic luster with uniform reflectivity, this indicates restoration of optoelectronic properties.

Laser parameters were carefully controlled to stay below the 0.85 J/cm² ablation threshold, this prevented substrate damage. No evidence of thermal cracking or melting is observed, the crystalline integrity remains fully preserved. Post-cleaning surface energy measurements show 72 mN/m, this optimal value promotes excellent adhesion for subsequent semiconductor processing steps. The restoration is very-very complete, the surface now meets manufacturing specifications for advanced electronics applications.
