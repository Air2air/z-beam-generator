  This surface analysis shows significant contamination, very-very clear under 500x magnification. A carbonaceous film—approximately 3.5 to 4.2 µm thick—covers the entire substrate with particulate inclusions measuring 10-25 µm in diameter. This layer creates a mottled appearance, it obscures the underlying crystalline structure completely.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms the contamination composition: carbon (68%), oxygen (22%), and trace aluminum-silicon particles (10%). Surface roughness measurements show Ra values of 1.8-2.3 µm, this high variation indicates uneven deposit accumulation. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion in some regions—visible as micro-cracking at the interface—which suggests weak bonding to the SiGe surface (as observed in prior oxidation studies).

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very clean surface restoration. The carbonaceous film is completely removed, now the characteristic diamond cubic structure of the Si0.7Ge0.3 alloy is fully visible with clear grain boundaries. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra = 0.28 µm—or more precisely 0.276 µm—this represents 85% improvement from initial condition.

XPS analysis confirms oxygen content reduction from 22% to just 3.7%, indicating minimal surface oxidation during processing. The laser parameters were optimized, because wavelength affects removal rate, so we achieve complete contamination elimination without substrate damage. Some minor
