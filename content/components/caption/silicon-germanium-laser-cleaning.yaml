# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the silicon germanium Laser cleaning of Silicon Germanium (SiGe) alloys utilizes precise wavelength absorption characteristics at 1064nm where SiGe exhibits strong absorption coefficients of 10³-10⁴ cm⁻¹. The process enables selective removal of surface contaminants while preserving the crystalline structure and electrical properties of the SiGe substrate, critical for semiconductor applications where surface integrity determines device performance.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The silicon germanium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of semiconductor materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The silicon germanium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
