  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the porphyry stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The porphyry exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The porphyry substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
