# Caption Content for Porphyry
before_text: |
  SEM analysis reveals a complex contamination layer (15-25 µm thick) comprising gypsum crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O), carbonaceous particulates (C, 12-18 at%), and iron oxide deposits (Fe₂O₃, 5-8 at%) embedded within the porphyry's microporosity (2.5%). The phenocryst-rich surface exhibits differential contamination, with preferential accumulation around quartz (Mohs 7) and feldspar (Mohs 6) crystals. White light interferometry measures surface roughness Sa = 8.3 µm, with contamination-induced peak-to-valley distances exceeding 45 µm. The low thermal conductivity (2.9 W/m·K) and high thermal expansion coefficient (8.5×10⁻⁶/K) create significant thermal stress risks during laser irradiation. At 1064 nm wavelength, the contaminated surface exhibits reflectivity of 0.15 with absorption coefficient of 0.85, while the ablation threshold is reduced to approximately 0.8 J/cm² due to surface contaminants acting as preferential absorption sites.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.5 J/cm² fluence (optimized between contamination ablation threshold and substrate damage threshold of 1.2 J/cm²) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving the original porphyry microstructure. Post-treatment profilometry shows surface roughness reduced to Sa = 2.1 µm (75% improvement), with maximum peak-to-valley distance of 12 µm. EDX analysis confirms contaminant reduction to <0.5 at% for sulfur and iron. XPS reveals intact feldspar lattice structure with no evidence of thermal degradation. AFM measurements demonstrate sub-micron surface preservation with Ra = 0.45 µm. The treatment maintained compressive strength integrity (180 MPa) while eliminating 98.7% of surface contaminants as quantified by Raman spectroscopy, with no detectable microcracking or mineral phase alterations observed in cross-sectional SEM analysis.
