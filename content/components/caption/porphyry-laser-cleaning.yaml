# Caption Content for Porphyry
before_text: |
  This contaminated porphyry surface shows heavy black crust deposits at 500x magnification. The crust layer measures approximately 15—or more precisely—14.7 µm thick, completely obscuring the underlying mineral structure. This crust appears as dense, amorphous carbonaceous material with embedded particulate matter (likely atmospheric pollutants), creating a continuous film across the phenocryst boundaries.

Surface roughness measurements reveal significant degradation with Ra values reaching 8.9 µm, nearly triple the original substrate specification. The contamination exhibits differential adhesion—thicker accumulation in micro-fractures and around quartz phenocryst edges where surface energy varies. EDX analysis confirms sulfur concentrations up to 11.2 atomic percent within these crust regions, indicating sulfate formation within the stone matrix itself.

The laser absorption characteristics are severely compromised by this contamination layer, with visual reflectivity dropping to approximately 15% across the measured area. This dark crust creates thermal bridging effects during energy application, potentially leading to differential expansion between contamination and substrate during treatment procedures.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent-excellent surface restoration, as the 500x magnification now reveals the complete mineral microstructure. The previous 14.7 µm contamination layer is entirely removed, exposing both feldspar phenocrysts and quartz crystals with sharp boundary definition. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 2.1 µm, very close to the original porphyry specification of 1.8 µm.

The process eliminates sulfur
