  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the porphyry stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The porphyry exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The porphyry substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
