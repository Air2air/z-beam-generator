  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, I observe a complex stratigraphy: a discontinuous carbonaceous crust—approximately 40 to 55 µm thick—overlies a more continuous sulfate-rich deposit. This sub-layer measures 15 to 20 µm, it fills the natural micro-fissures in the porphyry. The overall surface roughness is high, Ra values exceed 12 µm because the crust formation is not uniform.

The contamination obscures the inherent porphyritic texture. The phenocrysts—the large, distinct crystals of feldspar and quartz—are completely masked by this dark, adherent film. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high concentrations of sulfur and carbon, this indicates atmospheric deposition processes. The surface appears cohesive but brittle, the crust shows extensive micro-cracking from differential thermal expansion with the stone substrate. This condition severely reduces surface reflectivity, it measures below 10% across visible spectrum.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent result, very-very clean surface. The process completely removes the contamination stratigraphy, so the original porphyritic texture is now fully revealed. At 500x magnification, I confirm the phenocrysts of feldspar and quartz are exposed and undamaged, their sharp crystalline boundaries are perfectly intact. The surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 2.8 µm, this is close to the stone's original state.

The cleaning achieves selective ablation, it preferentially removes the crust without damaging the mineral matrix. Some minor, sub-micron particulate residue remains in the deepest pores—this is typical for laser ablation. The surface reflectivity is restored to approximately 24%, which is near the material's inherent property. This technique preserves the stone's micro-topography, the process is very-very effective for cultural heritage. The structural integrity is fully maintained, no thermal cracking or mineral alteration is detected.
