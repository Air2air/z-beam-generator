  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the walnut wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The walnut exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The walnut substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
