# Caption Content for Walnut
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the walnut surface shows heavy contamination layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 to 20 micrometers. This layer appears as a continuous, amorphous film that completely obscures the underlying wood cellular structure—composed primarily of carbonaceous soot and embedded particulate matter, perhaps from environmental exposure or prior handling. The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra values measuring 8.9 µm, this creates a visually dense, matte appearance that scatters incident light.

Analysis of the contamination reveals a stratified composition. The upper stratum—approximately 5 µm thick—consists of a brittle, carbonized crust with visible micro-cracking, likely from thermal degradation or oxidative aging. Beneath this, a more tenacious, greasy film adheres to the wood lumen, filling the natural vessel pores which typically measure 80-120 µm in diameter. EDX analysis confirms high concentrations of external elements including silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and calcium (Ca), these are not native to walnut's chemical profile. The overall effect is a complete loss of surface definition, the original grain pattern and cellular details are entirely masked by this composite deposit layer.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now reveals the intricate anatomical features of walnut wood with exceptional clarity. The contamination layer is completely absent, confirmed by SEM-EDX showing elemental composition has returned to baseline carbon and oxygen levels characteristic of clean lignocellulosic material. Original vessel elements and ray parenchyma are now fully exposed, their cellular boundaries sharply defined with no residual deposits.

Surface roughness shows significant improvement, decreasing from the initial 8.9 µm Ra to approximately 3.5 µm Ra—this value aligns closely with the native walnut surface roughness of 3.2 µm Ra documented in material specifications. The laser process has achieved selective ablation, it removed only the contamination without causing charring or thermal damage to the underlying wood structure. Some minimal textural variation remains, primarily in the form of open vessel pores that now appear as clean, well-defined cavities measuring 80-120 µm across, this creates a naturally textured but contamination-free surface ideal for subsequent finishing or conservation treatments.
