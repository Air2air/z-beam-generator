# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the walnut Laser cleaning of walnut (Juglans spp.) utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants. The process exploits the differential absorption characteristics between the contamination layer and the walnut substrate, which is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, allowing for non-contact, non-abrasive cleaning.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The walnut substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
