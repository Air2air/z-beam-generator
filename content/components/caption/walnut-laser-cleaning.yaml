# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the walnut wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The walnut exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The walnut substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
