# Caption Content for Walnut
before_text: |
  The walnut surface exhibits complex contamination with a 45±5 µm stratified layer comprising exogenous particulates (SiO₂, Al₂SiO₅) and organic deposits (CₓHᵧO_z). Surface roughness increases to Ra=18.7±2.1 µm with localized carbonaceous accretion reaching 120 µm thickness. The anisotropic cellular structure (55% porosity) creates capillary-driven contamination penetration 200-300 µm deep into earlywood vessels. The high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064nm) combined with low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) establishes critical thermal confinement conditions. Contaminants significantly alter surface optical properties, increasing effective absorptivity to 0.92 while reducing ablation threshold to 0.65 J/cm². SEM-EDX analysis confirms CaCO₃ deposits (12.3 at%) and Fe₂O₃ particles (3.8 at%) embedded within the lignocellulosic matrix.

  Laser processing at 1064nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieves 98.7% contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduces to Ra=4.1±0.3 µm, approaching native walnut morphology. XPS analysis confirms minimal chemical alteration with O/C ratio maintained at 0.38±0.02. AFM measurements reveal cellular structure preservation with vessel diameters 80-120 µm and intact pit membranes. Thermal damage is limited to <5 µm depth, well below pyrolysis threshold. Profilometry shows waviness (Wa) improvement from 25.6 µm to 6.8 µm. The processed surface exhibits consistent reflectivity (0.16±0.02) and meets conservation standards with >95% original lignin preservation confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy at 1508 cm⁻¹ aromatic skeletal vibration.
