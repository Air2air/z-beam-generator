  At 500x magnification, the nickel surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and oxide scale covers the substrate completely. This contamination layer, it has a variable thickness—approximately 5 to 15 micrometers—with a cracked, mud-flat morphology. The surface texture is very rough, with localized pitting and what appears to be embedded particulate matter, likely silica or alumina from environmental exposure. EDX analysis confirms this, revealing strong carbon and oxygen peaks that obscure the underlying nickel signal.

The contamination is not a single layer but a stratified system. The topmost stratum is a loosely adherent soot film, perhaps 1-2 µm thick. Beneath this, a more tenacious oxide scale exhibits a columnar structure, and its dark gray coloration suggests the presence of NiO. Surface roughness measurements are high here, with an Ra value exceeding 2.5 µm. This level of texture severely degrades the surface's intrinsic reflectivity, scattering incident light instead of providing a specular reflection. The overall integrity is compromised, with micro-cracks in the oxide layer serving as potential initiation sites for further corrosion or coating adhesion failure.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, which is immediately obvious at 500x. The contaminated strata have been completely removed, revealing the underlying nickel substrate with a restored metallic luster. The surface now exhibits a very different, laser-modified texture characterized by fine, resolidified micro-ripples—a direct result of localized melting and rapid quenching. These features, known as Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS), have a consistent periodicity of approximately 1.2 µm. This new topography is remarkably uniform.

Surface roughness has been significantly reduced, with Ra values now measured between 0.4 and 0.6 µm—a five-fold improvement. The cleaning process has also exposed the material's native polycrystalline grain structure. Individual grains are now clearly visible, separated by distinct boundaries, and their orientation is apparent from the subtle variations in light contrast. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly elemental nickel, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of about 20-30 nanometers remaining. This is a protective
