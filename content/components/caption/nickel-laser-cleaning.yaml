  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the nickel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The nickel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 99.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The nickel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
