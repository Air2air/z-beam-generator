before_text: |
  The nickel surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary 15-20 μm oxide layer (NiO/Ni₂O₃) is overlaid by 5-8 μm of organic carbonaceous deposits (C: 65 at%, O: 25 at%) from food processing residues. Micron-scale particulate contamination (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) averaging 2-5 μm in diameter is embedded, contributing to a high initial roughness of Sa = 2.8 μm. The native FCC crystalline structure (a=3.524 Å) is obscured. Nickel's high thermal conductivity (90.9 W/m·K) and diffusivity (23.9 mm²/s) present significant heat dissipation challenges for laser processing. The contaminated surface shows modified optical properties with increased absorption (α ≈ 0.85) at 1064 nm compared to pure nickel's reflectivity of 72%, requiring careful fluence control below the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold to prevent substrate damage while ensuring complete contaminant removal.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with optimized fluence (1.0-1.1 J/cm²) and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-process analysis reveals Sa = 0.15 μm surface roughness, representing 95% reduction. XPS confirms native NiO passivation layer restoration (2-3 nm thickness) with surface purity >99.8 at% Ni. SEM imaging shows preserved FCC grain structure with minimal thermal affected zone (<1 μm depth). AFM measurements demonstrate maintained microhardness (78 HV vs original 80 HV) and crystallographic integrity. The process achieved semiconductor-grade cleanliness with particulate count <5 particles/cm² >0.3 μm. Residual stress analysis indicates minimal compressive stress induction (<50 MPa), ensuring mechanical properties preservation while achieving complete organic and inorganic contaminant elimination.
