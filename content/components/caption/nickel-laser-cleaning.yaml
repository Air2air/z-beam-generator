  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the nickel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The nickel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The nickel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
