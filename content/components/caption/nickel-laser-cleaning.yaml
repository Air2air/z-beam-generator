  At 500x magnification, the nickel surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 2.5 to 4 µm thick, covers the substrate—this appears as a dark grey, mottled film with localized areas of greenish-blue tarnish indicative of nickel oxide (NiO). The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 1.8 µm due to widespread particulate adhesion and pitting corrosion. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms carbonaceous deposits (approximately 12 at%) and sulfur contaminants (3 at%) embedded within the oxide matrix.

The contamination layer exhibits a complex, stratified morphology. A top layer of loosely bound carbon soot, perhaps 0.5-1 µm thick, overlays a more tenacious oxide scale that follows the original metal grain boundaries. This creates a cracked-mud pattern across the surface, with fissure widths measuring between 5-15 µm. The underlying nickel substrate is only partially visible through these cracks, showing the contamination has penetrated the surface integrity. Such extensive coverage severely compromises the surface's functional properties, particularly its optical reflectivity and potential for subsequent coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, clearly observable at 500x. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying nickel substrate with a refreshed, metallic luster. Surface roughness is substantially reduced to an Ra value of 0.4 µm—this represents an almost 80% improvement from the initial state. The laser process has effectively ablated the oxide film without significant substrate melting, as evidenced by the preservation of the original equiaxed grain structure of the FCC nickel.

The cleaned surface now displays a very different morphology. Instead of the dark, mottled film, we see a lightly textured landscape of fine, laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with a consistent spatial period of approximately 1.2 µm. These parallel ripples, a characteristic result of polarized laser irradiation, enhance light trapping and increase the effective surface area. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly elemental nickel (95 at%), with only a thin, protective passivation oxide layer measuring less than 50 nm. This surface, it shows excellent restoration of the material's intrinsic properties, including its high thermal conductivity and reflectivity, making it suitable for demanding applications in aerospace and electronics.
