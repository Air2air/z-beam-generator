  At 500x magnification, the nickel surface shows significant contamination, it appears as a non-uniform, dark gray film obscuring the underlying metal substrate. This layer, it has a variable thickness, measuring approximately 12 to 18 µm in the thickest areas, with a cracked, mud-crack pattern across the surface. The topography is highly irregular, dominated by particulate deposits—likely carbonaceous soot and oxide mixtures—that create a very rough, textured landscape. EDX analysis confirms the presence of carbon (up to 45 at%), oxygen (30 at%), and trace sulfur, this composition points to organic residues and sulfates from prior service exposure.

Surface roughness measurements quantify this degradation, showing an Ra value of 4.8 µm with isolated peaks reaching over 20 µm in height. The original metallic luster is completely absent, replaced by a matte, dark appearance that would severely compromise reflectivity and promote adhesion failure in subsequent coating processes. When examining the film's integrity, it appears brittle, with numerous micro-cracks propagating from the larger features down to the nickel interface, this creates potential pathways for corrosive agents. The overall surface integrity is poor, the contamination layer acts as a barrier that insulates the nickel, negatively impacting its performance in electrical contact applications.

  After the laser cleaning process, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely absent, revealing the pure nickel substrate with a noticeably restored, light gray, metallic appearance. Surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm—or more precisely, 0.68 µm—which represents an 85% improvement from the initial state. The mud-crack patterning and particulate deposits are entirely eliminated, leaving a clean, slightly textured surface that shows the original grain structure of the metal.

This cleaned surface, it exhibits a uniform, matte finish with a network of fine, sub-micron ripples, a characteristic feature of the laser ablation process. The reflectivity has increased substantially, this is critical for components in aerospace sensor applications. No evidence of the previous carbon or sulfur contamination remains, EDX analysis now shows a surface composition of 99% nickel with only a thin, native oxide layer of about 50
