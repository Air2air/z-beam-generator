# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the nickel Nickel laser cleaning utilizes precise laser ablation to remove surface contaminants, oxides, and coatings without damaging the underlying substrate. The process leverages nickel's high thermal conductivity (90.9 W/m·K) and melting point (1455°C) for controlled material removal, making it ideal for precision industrial applications where chemical cleaning is prohibited or impractical.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The nickel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The nickel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
