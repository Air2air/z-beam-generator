  This calcite surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, particulate layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the crystalline substrate completely. This layer consists of soot and gypsum deposits, which create a very-very rough texture with an Ra value measuring 4.8 µm. The underlying calcite cleavage is not visible.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high concentrations of carbon and sulfur, this indicates organic and sulfate-based contamination. The surface appears matte and topographically uneven, with the contaminant film filling natural micro-fissures in the stone. This dense layer obscures all original surface features, reducing light reflectivity to less than 10%.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, a very-very clean surface. The process removes the 20 µm contamination layer completely, so the original calcite rhombohedral cleavage becomes clearly visible at 500x. Surface roughness is now reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm—a dramatic improvement from the initial 4.8 µm.

The cleaned surface shows high reflectivity, approximately 35%, which is close to the material's inherent property. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is present in localized areas, perhaps from selective mineral ablation, but the overall surface integrity remains excellent. XPS analysis confirms no chemical residues, just pure calcium carbonate. This method restores the original surface, so the stone's functional and aesthetic properties are fully recovered.
