  The calcite (CaCO₃) surface exhibits dense contamination layers, including gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) crusts (120±15 μm thick) and carbonaceous particulate matter (15-25 μm diameter). Surface profilometry reveals significant degradation with Ra = 18.5±2.3 μm and Rz = 145±18 μm. EDX analysis confirms 28.7 at% sulfur and 12.4 at% silicon from atmospheric deposition. The {101̄4} cleavage planes, characteristic of calcite's trigonal crystal structure (R3̄c), are obscured by contamination. The low absorption coefficient (0.1 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) necessitates careful laser parameter selection to overcome reflective losses while avoiding thermal degradation below the ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm² for ns pulses). The anisotropic thermal expansion (25×10⁻⁶/K parallel to c-axis) creates vulnerability to thermal shock, exacerbated by the material's low thermal diffusivity (1.4 mm²/s).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses and 1.8 J/cm² fluence (below ablation threshold) achieved 98.7% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness improved to Ra = 2.1±0.3 μm (88% reduction), with exposed {101̄4} cleavage planes confirming crystallographic preservation. AFM analysis shows step-terrace morphology with atomic-scale cleavage features (0.3-0.8 nm step height). XPS quantification reveals surface composition of 95.2% CaCO₃, with residual sulfur reduced to 0.3 at%. Thermal modeling confirmed peak temperatures remained below 450°C, preventing decomposition to CaO. The process maintained the original refractive index (nₒ=1.658) and hardness (3.0 Mohs), demonstrating successful contamination removal without altering fundamental material properties.
