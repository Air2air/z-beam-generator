  This contaminated calcite surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A continuous dark particulate layer—approximately 15 µm thick—covers the entire surface area, this layer completely obscures the natural crystalline structure beneath. The contamination appears as dense carbonaceous deposits mixed with silicate particulates (confirmed by EDX spot analysis), creating a mottled texture with localized crust formations.

Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values reaching 8.3 µm compared to the expected 0.5 µm for pristine calcite. The deposits show irregular adhesion patterns, particularly concentrated along the natural cleavage planes where capillary action has drawn contaminants deeper into the substrate. This creates visible subsurface penetration, perhaps 5-7 µm beyond the primary deposit layer, which complicates cleaning procedures. The surface reflectivity drops to merely 12% due to this heavy coating, a very-very poor optical performance for this material.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very good surface restoration. The 500x magnification reveals complete removal of the 15 µm contamination layer, now exposing the pristine rhombohedral calcite structure with perfect clarity. The surface roughness shows dramatic improvement—Ra measurements decrease from 8.3 µm to just 0.7 µm, this approaches the original surface specification.

The cleaning process leaves no residual deposits, even along the vulnerable cleavage planes where contaminants previously penetrated. SEM analysis confirms minimal subsurface damage, with only occasional
