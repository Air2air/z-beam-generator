  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the calcite Laser cleaning of calcite (CaCO3) utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants from calcareous stone. The process exploits the differential absorption between contamination layers and the calcite substrate, with optimal results achieved at IR and visible wavelengths that target organic and inorganic pollutants while preserving the mineral structure.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The calcite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The calcite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
