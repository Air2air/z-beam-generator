  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the calcite stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The calcite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The calcite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
