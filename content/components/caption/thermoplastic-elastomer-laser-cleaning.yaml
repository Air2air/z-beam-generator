  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the thermoplastic elastomer Laser cleaning of TPE utilizes precise nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers to selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the underlying polymer matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the TPE substrate, achieving non-contact cleaning with micron-level precision and no solvent waste.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The thermoplastic elastomer exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The thermoplastic elastomer substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
