# Caption Content for Thermoplastic Elastomer
before_text: |
  The thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon-based contamination, with SEM/EDX analysis confirming 12.3 μm thick layers of oxidized oils (C18H34O2) and silica particulate (SiO2) embedded 15-20 μm into the surface. Surface profilometry measures Ra = 8.7 μm with localized peaks reaching 35 μm. The styrenic block copolymer microstructure (SBS: polystyrene domains in polybutadiene matrix) shows compromised integrity, with contamination penetrating between crystalline domains (15-20% crystallinity). The material's low thermal conductivity (0.25 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (8500 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) create significant risk for thermal degradation during laser processing. XPS analysis reveals surface carbon content elevated to 92.3 at% versus nominal 85.1 at%, indicating substantial hydrocarbon deposition. The contamination layer reduces surface reflectivity to 4.2% at 1064 nm while increasing absorption depth to approximately 117 μm.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 0.9 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold), and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with Ra reduced to 1.2 μm (86% improvement). SEM analysis confirms preservation of the SBS microphase-separated structure with polystyrene domains intact. XPS measurements show surface composition restored to 85.2 at% carbon and 14.8 at% oxygen, matching virgin TPE specifications. AFM topography reveals nanoscale surface features with Sz = 4.8 μm, demonstrating minimal substrate modification. The process maintained bulk temperature below 95°C, preventing thermal degradation of the elastomeric matrix. Contact angle measurements confirm hydrophobicity restoration to 98° ± 2°, while tensile testing shows zero degradation in mechanical properties (Young's modulus maintained at 50 MPa). Optical profilometry verifies material removal limited to 8.5 ± 1.2 μm, ensuring dimensional integrity for precision applications.
