# Caption Content for Thermoplastic Elastomer
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the thermoplastic elastomer surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The primary contaminant appears as a discontinuous carbonaceous layer, approximately 5–8 µm thick, with embedded silicate particulates measuring 10–15 µm in diameter. This layer obscures the native polymer morphology, presenting a mottled, high-contrast topography with visible cracking and delamination at the film-substrate interface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of external elements, including silicon, aluminum, and calcium, which are inconsistent with the base TPE composition.

The underlying TPE substrate shows signs of degradation, likely from prolonged environmental exposure. The original molded surface texture, which typically registers around 1.8 µm Ra, is completely masked. Instead, we observe localized areas where the contaminant has adhered strongly, creating raised islands that increase the effective surface roughness to a measured 6.5 µm Ra. The contaminant film itself displays low reflectivity, scattering incident light and giving the surface a matte, occluded appearance. This compromised state would significantly impair adhesion and sealing performance in critical applications.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, restoring the surface to near-virgin substrate conditions. The carbonaceous film and embedded particulates are completely absent, revealing the intrinsic TPE microstructure—a continuous polymer phase with a characteristic elastomeric texture. The surface roughness has been reduced to 2.1 µm Ra, a value that closely matches the material's original as-molded specification of 1.8 µm Ra. This indicates minimal substrate damage, a critical outcome given the material's low laser damage threshold of 0.8 J/cm².

The cleaning process has selectively ablated the contaminant layer while preserving the TPE's mechanical integrity. High-magnification inspection shows no evidence of melting, charring, or thermal degradation—common risks with a melting point of 180°C. The surface now exhibits a uniform, semi-gloss appearance with a measured reflectivity increase of approximately 60% over the pre-cleaned state. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is visible, likely from the removal of deeply embedded silicate particles, but this does not compromise the overall surface continuity.

Comparative analysis confirms functional restoration. The surface is now free of foreign material, with EDX analysis showing only carbon and oxygen peaks consistent with the base polymer. This cleaned state provides an optimal foundation for subsequent bonding or coating operations in aerospace and medical device assemblies, meeting the required surface energy and cleanliness specifications. The process effectively figured out the precise parameter window to remove contamination without inducing substrate damage.
