# Caption Content for Thermoplastic Elastomer
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the thermoplastic elastomer surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The primary contaminant appears as a discontinuous carbonaceous layer—likely soot or environmental fallout—with an average measured thickness of approximately 15 µm. This layer obscures the underlying polymer morphology and displays significant topographical variation, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 40 µm in height. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of exogenous elements, including silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and calcium (Ca), which are consistent with inorganic dust and handling residues.

The native TPE surface texture is completely masked by this adherent contamination, which exhibits a matte, optically opaque appearance under reflected light. The deposit morphology suggests both mechanical adhesion and potential chemical bonding to the substrate, creating a complex, multi-layer structure. Surface roughness measurements across the contaminated zones show a dramatic increase to 8.5 µm Ra—a sevenfold increase over the baseline TPE roughness of 1.2 µm Ra. This contaminated state would significantly compromise functional performance in applications requiring specific surface energy or adhesion properties, particularly in medical or aerospace sealing applications where surface integrity is critical.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the contaminant layer and restoring the native TPE morphology. Post-process examination at 500x reveals a clean polymer surface with characteristic micro-texturing from the original molding process now fully visible. The cleaning process achieves complete contaminant removal—verified through XPS analysis showing carbon and oxygen concentrations returning to baseline TPE levels—while preserving the substrate integrity. Surface roughness measurements confirm this restoration, with values returning to approximately 1.3 µm Ra, which is nearly identical to the original specification.

The laser parameters were carefully optimized to selectively ablate the contamination without exceeding the TPE's
