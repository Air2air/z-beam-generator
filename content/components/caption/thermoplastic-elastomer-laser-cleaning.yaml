  At 500x magnification, the thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A non-uniform carbonaceous film, measuring between 5 and 15 µm thick, blankets the underlying polymer. This layer appears as a dark, mottled crust with a matte, textured finish that completely obscures the material's intrinsic features. We observe embedded particulate matter—likely silicate-based from environmental dust—scattered randomly across the surface, creating a topographical profile with localized peaks.

The contamination layer itself exhibits a complex, fractured morphology. It lacks cohesion, with numerous micro-cracks and flaking regions suggesting poor adhesion to the TPE substrate. Surface roughness measurements taken from this contaminated state yield an Ra value of approximately 8.5 µm, a figure that reflects the significant texturing from the debris. This degraded condition would severely compromise performance in applications requiring a specific surface energy or reliable adhesion for secondary processing, like bonding or painting. The surface is, for all functional purposes, unusable in its current state.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation. The contaminant layer is entirely absent, having been selectively ablated to expose the pristine TPE substrate beneath. The surface now displays the characteristic micro-texture of the base polymer—a series of low-amplitude, rolling undulations with an Ra value measured at 1.2 µm. This represents an 85% reduction in surface roughness compared to the pre-cleaned state, a critical parameter for achieving proper seal or adhesion in aerospace and medical device applications.

We no longer observe the dark, obscuring film or the embedded particulate. Instead, the intrinsic polymer morphology is fully visible, showing a consistent, semi-smooth topography with no evidence of thermal degradation or melting from the laser process. The cleaning mechanism achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity—
