# Caption Content for Serpentine
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the serpentine surface exhibits a complex, discontinuous contamination layer averaging 45–60 µm in thickness. This layer comprises particulate matter—primarily carbonaceous soot and silicate dust—embedded within a sulfated crust of gypsum and other efflorescent salts. The underlying serpentine shows a characteristic flaky, interlocking texture, but its natural green and yellow hues are completely obscured. Surface roughness measurements yield an Ra of 18.5 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent texture.

The contamination adheres tenaciously, filling the natural micro-fissures and porosity of the stone. You can see the crust has a cracked, mud-cake morphology in some areas, while other zones show a more uniform, dark film. This variation in deposit structure suggests different environmental exposure histories across the sample. The deposits create a topographically complex, matte surface that would scatter incident light, drastically reducing its inherent reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic transformation, removing the contamination layer and restoring the original serpentine substrate. Post-treatment analysis at 500x reveals a clean surface with an Ra value of 2.1 µm—a nearly nine-fold reduction in roughness. The stone's intrinsic phyllosilicate structure is now fully exposed, displaying its characteristic waxy luster and subtle green and yellow veining. The laser process has effectively ablated the crust without damaging the underlying mineral fabric.

We observed minimal thermal alteration. The process did not induce the micro-fracturing or melting that can occur if you exceed the material's thermal destruction point of approximately 600°C. Some isolated, sub-micron pits are visible—these are likely where the laser selectively ablated more absorbent, dark inclusions within the stone itself. The surface porosity has been restored to its native state, measured at 2
