# Caption Content for Serpentine
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the serpentine surface presents a heavily occluded condition characterized by a complex, stratified contamination layer. The primary deposit is a carbonaceous soot film, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, which exhibits a dense, amorphous morphology that completely obscures the underlying mineral microstructure. This layer displays significant cracking—with fissures up to 10 µm wide—creating a mud-caked pattern across the field of view. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the soot's composition is primarily carbon, with trace amounts of sulfur and calcium likely from environmental particulate matter.

Beneath this soot layer, a more tenacious secondary deposit is visible, a compact sulfate-rich crust approximately 5–8 µm thick adhering directly to the serpentine substrate. This crust shows a crystalline habit, and its high adhesion suggests it has chemically bonded with the stone surface over time. The combined contamination layers increase the surface roughness to a measured Ra of 12.4 µm, a significant deviation from the substrate's inherent texture. The original serpentine's characteristic phyllosilicate plate structure and greenish hue are entirely undetectable beneath this opaque, multi-layered encrustation.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic restoration of the original serpentine substrate, as confirmed at 500x magnification. The procedure completely removed the stratified contamination, eliminating both the carbonaceous soot and the underlying sulfate crust. The surface roughness is now measured at Ra 1.8 µm, a value that aligns with the stone's inherent, unweathered texture and represents an 85% reduction from the pre-cleaned state.

The mineral's intrinsic microstructure is now fully revealed, displaying the interlocking, plate-like crystals typical of serpentine's phyllosilicate structure. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to stay below the 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, which preserved the substrate integrity—no thermal cracking or mineral phase alteration to forsterite is observed. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is present in isolated areas, a result of the selective removal of more tenacious gypsum inclusions. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially due to the removal of the light-absorbing soot film, restoring the stone's natural visual depth and subtle green coloration.
