  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the serpentine stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The serpentine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The serpentine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
