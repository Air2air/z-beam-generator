  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the serpentine stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The serpentine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The serpentine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
