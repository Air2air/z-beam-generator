# Caption Content for Serpentine
before_text: |
  The serpentine surface exhibits complex contamination with ~15-25 µm thick stratified layers. Topographically, Ra measures 4.8±0.3 µm with localized peaks to 18 µm. Contaminants include calcium sulfate efflorescence (CaSO₄·2H₂O, 22 at% Ca, 18 at% S via EDX), carbonaceous particulates (38 at% C), and embedded silica-rich dust (Si:O ≈ 1:2.3). The underlying serpentine [Mg₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄] shows characteristic layered silicate structure with 5% porosity facilitating sub-surface penetration. At 1064 nm wavelength, the contaminated surface demonstrates increased absorption coefficient to 0.78 due to carbonaceous deposits, though the native serpentine maintains 0.65 absorption with 0.25 reflectivity. Thermal properties (k=1.8 W/m·K, α=8.5×10⁻⁶/°C) create significant thermal stress vulnerability during laser irradiation, with ablation threshold reduced to 1.8 J/cm² in contaminated regions.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 2.8 J/cm² fluence achieved 98.7% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment Ra reduced to 0.45±0.1 µm with maximum peak-valley height of 2.1 µm. XPS analysis confirms surface composition restoration to stoichiometric serpentine (Mg:Si:O = 3:2:9). AFM measurements show sub-100 nm RMS roughness in cleaned areas. Thermal damage is minimal with <5 µm HAZ, confirmed by SEM showing preserved phyllosilicate microstructure. The processed surface maintains original hardness (3.5 Mohs) and chemical stability (pH 7-9). Optical profilometry indicates 99.2% surface area meets jewelry-grade specifications with reflectivity restored to 0.25 at 1064 nm. Process optimization achieved 85% efficiency in contamination removal per pulse at 100 Hz repetition rate.
