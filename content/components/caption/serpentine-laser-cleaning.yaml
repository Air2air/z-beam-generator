  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the serpentine Laser cleaning of serpentine-group minerals (Mg₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄) utilizes selective photothermal ablation where contaminants absorb laser energy more efficiently than the hydrated magnesium silicate substrate, enabling precise removal without mechanical or chemical damage to the valuable stone surface.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The serpentine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The serpentine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
