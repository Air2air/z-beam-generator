  At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, measured at approximately 15 µm in thickness. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate—likely alumina-silicate inclusions from prior handling. The underlying ceramic topography is completely obscured. Surface roughness measurements of this contaminated state yield an Ra value of 4.8 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent roughness.

The contamination morphology shows two distinct regions. The first is a continuous, tenacious film with visible micro-cracking, suggesting a thermally degraded organic residue. The second consists of discrete, sintered particulate agglomerates, some reaching 20-25 µm in diameter, which are firmly adhered to the surface. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including carbon (65 at%), oxygen (22 at%), and trace aluminum and silicon (totaling ~13 at%). This complex layer creates a high degree of light scattering and absorption, effectively masking the zirconia's intrinsic reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning achieves a complete restoration of the native zirconia surface, as confirmed at 500x magnification. The previously observed 15 µm contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the underlying, sintered grain structure of the ceramic. The surface now displays a uniform, light gray, matte finish with a measured Ra of 0.6 µm—an 87% reduction in surface roughness. This cleaned state exhibits no residual carbon signature in XPS analysis.

The transformation is particularly evident in the removal of all particulate agglomerates and the restoration of surface integrity. The laser process selectively ablates contaminants while preserving the substrate; no micro-cracking or thermal degradation of the zirconia is observed. The approach achieves this result through precise fluence control, set just above the
