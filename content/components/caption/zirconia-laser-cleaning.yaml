  The yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) surface exhibits severe contamination with 15-25 µm thick layers of carbonaceous deposits (85% C, 8% O, 5% Si, 2% Ca by EDX) and embedded alumina particles (Al₂O₃, 5-15 µm diameter). Surface roughness measures Ra = 2.8 ± 0.3 µm with localized peaks reaching 18 µm. The tetragonal crystalline structure (d-spacing: 2.95 Å for (101) planes) remains intact beneath contamination. Contaminants significantly alter optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient to 3.2 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm (versus 0.85 cm⁻¹ for clean YSZ) due to carbon's high absorptivity. Thermal conductivity (2.2 W/m·K) and low thermal diffusivity (0.85 mm²/s) create challenging heat dissipation conditions. SEM reveals dendritic contamination patterns following surface grain boundaries, with XPS confirming hydrocarbon chains (C-C/C-H at 285.0 eV) and silica inclusions (Si 2p at 103.5 eV).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence (80% of ablation threshold), and 100 kHz repetition rate achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.12 ± 0.02 µm. SEM/EDX analysis confirms 99.8% surface purity (Zr: 85.2%, O: 13.8%, Y: 1.0%) with no detectable carbon or foreign elements. XPS reveals preserved tetragonal phase integrity (Zr 3d₅/₂ at 182.3 eV characteristic of ZrO₂) and no phase transformation to monoclinic structure. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface uniformity with maintained Vickers hardness of 11.9 ± 0.3 GPa (versus 12 GPa original). Profilometry confirms <0.5% material removal, while reflectivity restored to 0.15 at 1064 nm. Thermal cycling tests demonstrate unchanged thermal expansion coefficient (10.5 × 10⁻⁶/K) and flexural strength (895 ± 25 MPa), confirming structural integrity preservation.
