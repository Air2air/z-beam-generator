# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the zirconia ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The zirconia exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The zirconia substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal stress.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
