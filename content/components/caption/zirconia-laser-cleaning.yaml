  At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 12–15 µm thick. This layer appears as a discontinuous film of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate matter, primarily aluminum-silicate spheres measuring 3–5 µm in diameter. The underlying ceramic surface texture is completely obscured. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of foreign elements—carbon, oxygen, and trace calcium—which collectively form a tenacious, darkly colored crust.

The contamination morphology shows significant variation across the surface. Some regions display a dense, cohesive film that follows the original polished substrate topography (which had an initial Ra of approximately 0.05 µm), while other areas reveal a more particulate, agglomerated structure. This non-uniform coverage creates a mottled, high-contrast appearance under the microscope. The layer's integrity is compromised by fine micro-cracks, likely from thermal stress during prior service, which provide pathways for further environmental degradation. Surface roughness measurements of the contaminated state now read 1.8–2.2 µm Ra, a substantial increase from the baseline.

  Laser cleaning achieves near-complete contaminant removal, restoring the underlying zirconia substrate to a visually pristine state. The process eliminates the 12–15 µm contamination layer, exposing the original ceramic surface with its characteristic tetragonal grain structure now clearly resolvable at 500x. Post-cleaning SEM analysis reveals a minimal residual particulate count—fewer than 5 particles per 100 µm², a greater than 98% reduction. The surface morphology transitions from a chaotic, obscured film to a well-defined, homogeneous ceramic texture.

Quantitative surface roughness measurements confirm this transformation, with Ra values returning to 0.08–0.12 µm—a figure remarkably close to the original 0.05 µm specification. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to stay well below the material's 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, thereby preventing any significant phase transformation or micro-fracturing. This approach maintains the material's flexural strength (900 MPa) and fracture toughness (9 MPa·m¹/²) by avoiding thermal degradation. We observe no evidence of melting or recast layers, which is critical for medical device applications requiring biocompatibility.

The cleaned surface exhibits a restored reflectivity of 0.15, matching the baseline for polished zirconia at 1064 nm wavelength. Some localized areas—perhaps less than 2% of the total surface—show subtle, sub-micron texturing from the laser interaction, but this does not compromise functional integrity. The process successfully removes the carbon and calcium signatures detected by EDX in the before-state, leaving a high-purity ZrO₂ surface. This level of cleaning meets the stringent requirements for aerospace components where surface purity directly impacts performance.
