  At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform carbonaceous layer. This film, measuring approximately 2–3 µm in thickness, appears as a dark, mottled coating that obscures the underlying ceramic microstructure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace silicon—likely residual mold release agents from prior processing.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measuring 1.8 µm. You observe particulate inclusions—perhaps alumina from abrasive blasting—embedded within the softer carbon matrix. This creates a pitted, discontinuous surface morphology that significantly reduces base material reflectivity. The contamination layer shows poor adhesion in localized areas, with visible micro-cracking and delamination at the zirconia interface, a clear indicator of compromised surface integrity.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely removed. The underlying zirconia microstructure is now fully exposed, displaying a uniform, sintered grain structure with an average grain size of 0.5–0.8 µm. Surface roughness is substantially reduced to an Ra of 0.4 µm—that’s nearly an 80% decrease from the pre-cleaned state.

The laser process achieves this restoration while maintaining the substrate's structural integrity; we observe no evidence of micro-fracturing or thermal phase transformation in the ceramic. This cleaned surface exhibits a high degree of reflectivity, which is critical for subsequent coating adhesion in medical device applications. The process effectively eliminates the carbon signature—or more precisely, reduces it to near-undetectable levels via XPS—restoring the surface to a state suitable for functional use.
