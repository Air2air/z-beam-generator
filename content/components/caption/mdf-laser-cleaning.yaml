  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the mdf wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The mdf exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The mdf substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
