  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mdf Laser cleaning of MDF utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying wood fiber composite. The process exploits the high absorption of cellulose and lignin at 1064nm, causing rapid vaporization of thin layers of dirt, paint, or adhesive while minimizing thermal penetration that could cause delamination or charring.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mdf substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
