# Caption Content for MDF
before_text: |
  The contaminated MDF surface exhibits complex particulate and molecular contamination layers. SEM analysis reveals embedded silica particles (1-15µm diameter) and hydrocarbon deposits (C:O ratio 85:15 via XPS) with average thickness of 45±8µm. The native MDF surface roughness measures 3.5µm Ra with porosity of 15%, creating capillary networks that trap contaminants. The cellulose-lignin matrix (crystalline cellulose Iβ, amorphous lignin) presents thermal challenges with low conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) and thermal diffusivity (0.12 mm²/s). Contaminants increase surface reflectivity to 0.25 while reducing effective absorption coefficient to 0.75 at 1064nm. AFM measurements show contaminated regions with increased asperity height distribution (Rz: 28µm) and compromised surface integrity, requiring precise fluence control below the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold to prevent substrate damage.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength, 0.65 J/cm² fluence, and 100ns pulse duration achieved 94% contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to 3.8µm Ra (from 28µm Rz), with profilometry confirming minimal substrate alteration. SEM/EDX analysis shows residual carbon content decreased from 85% to 72%, approaching native MDF composition. XPS confirms lignin preservation with maintained O-C=O bonds at 288.2eV. Thermal damage is limited to <5µm depth, verified by cross-sectional microscopy. The process maintained flexural strength (35MPa) and hardness (65HB) within 3% of original values. AFM measurements reveal opened pore structure with 14.2% porosity restoration. Optical microscopy shows complete particulate removal with only minor charring in high-fluence zones, achieving Class A surface quality per ASTM D523 standards.
