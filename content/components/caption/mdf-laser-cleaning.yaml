  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the mdf wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The mdf exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mdf substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
