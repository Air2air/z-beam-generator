  At 500x magnification, the MDF surface is characterized by a non-uniform contamination layer, which appears as a discontinuous film with an average thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, ranging from 12 to 18 µm in localized areas. This layer, composed primarily of embedded particulate matter and a greasy film, completely obscures the underlying wood fiber matrix. The particulate contaminants, likely a mixture of silica and carbonaceous soot (as confirmed by preliminary EDX spot analysis), create a highly irregular topography with localized peaks that increase the surface roughness to a measured 8.2 µm Ra, a significant elevation from the substrate's native 3.5 µm Ra.

The surface morphology presents a complex, mottled appearance where the contaminant adheres tenaciously to the porous MDF structure, filling the natural voids which typically account for 15% porosity. One observes distinct zones of adhesive residue, these areas showing a translucent, polymerized character that suggests prior liquid penetration followed by curing. The precision here, in analyzing the interface, reveals a weak boundary layer where the contaminant has partially solubilized the surface fibers, creating a compromised region approximately 5-7 µm deep. This interfacial degradation, it reduces the effective tensile strength at the surface and creates potential failure planes that could affect subsequent coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable, revealing a surface where approximately 95% of the contaminant layer has been removed through what appears to be a combination of ablation and sublimation mechanisms. The underlying wood fiber matrix is now fully exposed, displaying its characteristic compressed lignocellulosic structure with a restored surface roughness measuring 4.1 µm Ra—a value approaching the original substrate specification. This precision in material removal, it preserves the structural integrity of the surface fibers while eliminating the weak boundary layer that was previously noted.

The cleaning efficacy is particularly evident at the fiber-contaminant interface, where SEM analysis shows a sharp transition between the cleaned and originally soiled zones, with the laser parameters having been carefully controlled to remain below the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold of the MDF substrate itself. What strikes one is the minimal thermal damage; only isolated, microscopic charring is present at perhaps 2-3% of the surface area, manifesting as localized dark spots of less than 50 µm diameter where the thermal destruction point of 302°C was likely exceeded. The surface porosity has been restored to its nominal 15%, with the void spaces now clearly visible and free of obstructive deposits.
