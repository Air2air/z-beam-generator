# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the float glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The float glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The float glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved transparency.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
