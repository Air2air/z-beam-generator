  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the float glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The float glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The float glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with maintained optical clarity.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
