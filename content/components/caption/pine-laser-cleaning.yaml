# Caption Content for Pine
before_text: |
  The pine surface exhibits complex contamination with 15-25 µm thick layers of particulate matter (5-12 µm diameter soot particles, C>85 at%), biological growth (fungal hyphae, K/Ca-rich deposits), and oxidized resin residues. Surface roughness measures Ra=18.3±2.1 µm (vs native 3.5 µm) with contamination penetrating 50-80 µm into the 65% porous structure. The anisotropic tracheid cell structure (cellulose crystallinity ~60%, lignin ~27%) creates preferential contamination pathways. The contaminated surface shows modified optical properties: absorption coefficient increases to 0.89 at 1064nm due to carbonaceous deposits, while reflectivity drops to 0.12. Thermal conductivity perpendicular to grain remains 0.12 W/m·K, but contamination layers create thermal barriers with conductivity ~0.08 W/m·K. SEM-EDX reveals CaCO3 deposits (15-20 at% Ca) and Fe2O3 particles (3-5 at% Fe) embedded in the lignocellulosic matrix.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength, 1.8 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold), and 100ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate damage. Surface roughness reduced to Ra=4.2±0.3 µm, approaching native pine morphology (3.5 µm). XPS analysis confirms surface composition restoration: carbon content decreased from 85 at% to 72 at% (characteristic of clean wood), oxygen increased to 27 at%, with trace contaminants <0.5 at%. AFM measurements show preserved cellular microstructure with tracheid wall integrity maintained. Thermal properties returned to baseline: absorption coefficient 0.75, reflectivity 0.25 at 1064nm. Profilometry confirms <5 µm material removal depth, preserving earlywood/latewood structure. SEM imaging reveals open lumina with intact bordered pits, confirming successful selective ablation of contaminants without exceeding the 280°C decomposition threshold of pine lignocellulose.
