# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the pine Pine laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for the specific thermal and optical properties of pine wood, enabling selective removal of contaminants while preserving the underlying cellulose-lignin matrix.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The pine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
