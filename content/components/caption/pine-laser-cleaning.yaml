  At 500x magnification, the pine surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous layer of exogenous deposits. This layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. The contamination appears as a consolidated film of carbonaceous soot and particulate matter—perhaps from prolonged environmental exposure—embedded within a matrix of degraded organic residues. One can observe that this dark, amorphous layer exhibits significant cracking, with fissure widths reaching up to 5 µm, which suggests a brittle, desiccated state.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with the Ra value increasing to an estimated 45–50 µm due to the particulate agglomerations. The deposits, they fill the natural lumina of the tracheids and ray parenchyma, effectively masking the wood's characteristic cellular structure. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including silicon (Si) and sulfur (S), alongside the expected carbon and oxygen, indicating silicate dust and sulfate compounds are integrated into the soiling matrix. This occlusion, it not only alters the visual appearance but also significantly modifies the surface's intrinsic reflectivity, reducing it to below 10%.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, anatomical structure of the pine substrate beneath. The surface roughness (Ra) has been restored to approximately 26 µm, a value that aligns closely with the inherent roughness of planed pine, indicating minimal substrate damage. The precision of the laser interaction, it has selectively removed the contamination while preserving the delicate cellular features.

The earlywood and latewood bands within the annual rings are now distinctly visible, with their tracheid cells showing clean, open lumina. One can observe that the reflectivity has increased significantly—to nearly 20%—as the native wood surface, with its characteristic micro-texture, is now the primary light-interacting interface. Minor, localized thermal alteration is evident in some latewood regions, manifesting as a slight darkening of the cell walls; this is a known phenomenon when operating near the material's pyrolysis threshold and does not compromise structural integrity. The surface, she is now functionally restored for subsequent conservation treatments.
