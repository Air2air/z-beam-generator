# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the pine wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The pine exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 96.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The pine substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
