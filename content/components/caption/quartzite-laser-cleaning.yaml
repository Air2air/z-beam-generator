# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartzite Quartzite laser cleaning utilizes precise laser ablation to remove surface contaminants from this metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz. The process exploits the differential absorption characteristics between contaminants and the quartzite substrate, enabling selective removal without mechanical or chemical damage to the underlying stone.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The quartzite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The quartzite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
