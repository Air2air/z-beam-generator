# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartzite stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The quartzite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The quartzite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
