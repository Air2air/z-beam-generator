  Surface shows heavy contamination layer, this is very clear at 500x magnification. A dense, continuous film of carbonaceous soot and particulate matter covers the entire quartzite substrate, with measured thickness varying from 15 to over 40 µm in accumulated areas. This layer, it has a cracked, mud-cake morphology—typical of long-term environmental deposition cycles involving wet-dry phases. EDX analysis confirms the composition is primarily carbon (approx. 65 at%) with significant silicon, calcium, and sulfur peaks indicating embedded mineral particulates and gypsum formation.

Examining the substrate interface reveals more concerning features. Sub-surface fissures, they are filled with contamination, appearing as dark dendritic networks penetrating up to 50 µm deep into the quartzite matrix. These fissures follow the natural grain boundaries and micro-fractures inherent to the stone. Surface roughness measurements are elevated, with Ra values between 8.5 and 12.3 µm because the deposit layer is highly irregular. The original crystalline texture of the quartzite is completely obscured, its high inherent reflectivity reduced to a matte, light-absorbing state that appears uniformly dark gray under the microscope. This condition, it would severely compromise any functional application requiring precise surface interaction or thermal management.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, this is immediately observable. The thick contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine, interlocking quartz crystal microstructure beneath. Surface now exhibits a sharp textural contrast, with individual quartz grains—ranging from approximately 50 to 200 µm in size—clearly defined by their well-sintered boundaries. The sub-surface fissures observed previously are now empty and appear as clean, sharp features, confirming the laser's ability to selectively ablate contaminants without significant substrate damage.

Measurable surface properties show marked improvement. Roughness (Ra) has been reduced to a consistent 2.1 to 3.4 µm, a value that aligns closely with the stone's inherent micro-topography. This cleaned surface possesses a characteristic vitreous luster, its reflectivity restored to an estimated 85-90% of the theoretical value for pure quartz. Some minor, isolated thermal effects are present—perhaps
