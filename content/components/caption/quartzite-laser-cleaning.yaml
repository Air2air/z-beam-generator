  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartzite stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The quartzite exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The quartzite substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
