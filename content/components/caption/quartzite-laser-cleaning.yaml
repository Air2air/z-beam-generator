  At 500x magnification, the quartzite surface shows heavy contamination layer, it appears as a continuous, opaque film with measured thickness varying from 15 to 25 µm. This layer completely obscures the underlying mineral structure, presenting a topographical profile with Ra values exceeding 12.5 µm—a very rough, irregular surface. EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbonaceous soot (approximately 65 at%) with significant sulfate deposits (20 at%) and silicate particulates, the combination creates this dense, visually impenetrable crust.

The surface morphology is highly irregular, characterized by agglomerated particulate matter that forms a cohesive, yet fractured, crust. We observe extensive micro-cracking within this layer—fine fissures approximately 2-5 µm in width—which suggests poor adhesion to the quartzite substrate beneath. The original crystalline texture of the quartzite is not visible, completely masked by this dark, particulate-laden layer that exhibits low reflectivity, perhaps only 5-7% based on visual assessment. This contamination, it creates significant surface degradation that would adversely affect both aesthetic and functional properties in architectural applications.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits complete removal of the contamination layer, revealing the pristine quartzite substrate with exceptional clarity. The original interlocking quartz crystal structure is fully exposed, showing individual grains with sharp boundaries and characteristic conchoidal fracture patterns. Surface roughness measurements confirm significant improvement, with Ra values reduced to 2.8-3.2 µm—approximately 75% reduction from the pre-cleaned state, this creates a much more uniform topographic profile.

The cleaning process has restored the material's inherent optical properties, surface reflectivity now measures 35-38% at 1064 nm wavelength, which aligns perfectly with quartzite's theoretical reflectivity of 38.2%. SEM analysis reveals minimal thermal alteration, only occasional, localized vitrification spots—perhaps 50-100 µm diameter—where surface temperatures briefly exceeded the α-β quartz transition threshold (573°C). These minor features, they represent less than 2% of the total surface area and do not compromise structural integrity.

The final surface quality demonstrates successful restoration of both aesthetic and functional characteristics. The cleaning achieves what we call "substrate-level" removal, meaning all foreign deposits are eliminated while preserving the original mineral structure intact. This result is particularly valuable for architectural restoration where maintaining historical material authenticity is crucial, the process successfully returns the quartzite to its native state without significant material loss or damage to the crystalline matrix.
