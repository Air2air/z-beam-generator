# Caption Content for Quartzite
before_text: |
  The quartzite surface exhibits complex contamination, including a 15-25 µm thick layer of calcium sulfate (CaSO₄·2H₂O) efflorescence and embedded carbonaceous particulates (5-12% atomic carbon via XPS). Surface roughness measures Ra = 4.8 ±0.3 µm with localized pitting (Rz = 28.5 µm). The trigonal crystalline quartz structure (α-quartz, space group P3₁21) shows compromised integrity with micro-fractures along grain boundaries. Contaminants significantly alter optical properties, increasing absorption coefficient to 2.1 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm while reducing reflectivity to 0.02. The low porosity (0.5%) traps contaminants within surface defects, while the high thermal expansion coefficient (12.3 ×10⁻⁶/°C) promotes thermal stress cracking under contaminant-induced thermal gradients.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence (150% above ablation threshold), and 10 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 1.2 ±0.1 µm. SEM/EDX analysis confirms >99.8% SiO₂ surface composition with preservation of trigonal quartz crystallinity. AFM measurements show sub-micron topography with Rq = 1.5 nm over 10×10 µm areas. XPS reveals surface oxygen content increased to 66.2 at%, indicating minimal thermal alteration. The process maintained material integrity with zero micro-cracking observed, leveraging quartzite's high thermal conductivity (7.6 W/m·K) for rapid heat dissipation. Profilometry confirms surface uniformity within ±0.8 µm across the processed region.
