before_text: |
  The polycrystalline tungsten surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 5.8±0.3 µm thick heterogeneous layer comprising carbonaceous deposits (65 at%), tungsten oxide (WO₃, 28 at%), and embedded alumina particles (7 at%). SEM reveals dendritic oxide growth along BCC grain boundaries, with surface roughness measuring Ra=3.2 µm. The contamination layer significantly alters optical properties, reducing reflectivity to 0.38 at 1064 nm while increasing absorption coefficient to 0.62 due to multiple scattering. XPS confirms WO₃ formation (W 4f₇/₂ at 35.8 eV) with adventitious carbon (C 1s at 284.8 eV). Tungsten's high thermal conductivity (173 W/m·K) and melting point (3422°C) create challenging thermal gradients during laser interaction, while the low thermal expansion coefficient (4.5×10⁻⁶/K) promotes interfacial stress at contamination boundaries.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses and fluence of 3.2 J/cm² (120% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contamination removal, reducing surface carbon content from 65 at% to <0.5 at%. Post-process analysis shows surface roughness improved to Ra=0.8 µm, with SEM confirming preservation of the underlying BCC grain structure. XPS reveals native tungsten surface regeneration (W 4f₇/₂ at 31.0 eV) with oxide reduction from 28 at% to 2.1 at%. AFM measurements demonstrate sub-100 nm surface integrity with no microcracking. Thermal modeling confirms controlled energy deposition below tungsten's melting threshold, leveraging its high thermal diffusivity (68.2 mm²/s). EDX analysis shows contaminant reduction to <50 ppm, meeting semiconductor-grade cleanliness specifications.
