  At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface shows significant contamination. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 12 to 18 µm thick, covers the substrate. This layer appears as a dark, mottled crust with a network of fine micro-cracks—likely from thermal stress during prior high-temperature exposure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 4.8 µm. This roughness, it creates a porous structure that traps particulate matter.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminant is tungsten trioxide (WO₃), which exhibits a characteristic dull, greyish-black coloration. There are also localized patches of embedded carbonaceous deposits, perhaps from hydrocarbon vapors, which appear as dark, sooty agglomerates. The underlying metal grain structure is completely obscured. The combination of this brittle oxide and the particulate contamination creates a surface that is visually heterogeneous and functionally compromised, with an effective laser reflectivity that is undoubtedly much lower than the base material's 52%.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely removed, revealing the underlying polycrystalline grain structure of the tungsten substrate. Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra value of 0.7 µm—a nearly sevenfold improvement. The surface now exhibits a light grey, metallic luster, which is consistent with restored reflectivity.

Some minor features remain, which is expected. You can see faint, shallow micro-craters, approximately 5–10 µm in diameter, where laser pulses ablated particularly tenacious oxide nodules. The grain boundaries are now very clear and well-defined. This cleaned surface, it shows no evidence of the former WO₃ layer, and XPS analysis would confirm a surface chemistry dominated by elemental tungsten. The process successfully restored the surface integrity without causing significant melting or recast layers, which is a critical outcome for components in aerospace and defense applications where dimensional stability is paramount.
