  At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface shows significant contamination layer, very clear even at this resolution. This layer, it appears as a dark, mottled film with an average thickness of approximately—or more precisely—14.7 µm, completely obscuring the underlying metal substrate. Surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 3.8 µm, this creates a porous, almost spongy appearance. The contamination itself seems to be a composite structure, perhaps from oxidation and carbon deposition (as observed in prior studies).

EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are oxygen and carbon, with trace amounts of silicon and sodium also present. Visually, the layer shows a cracked-mud pattern, with deep fissures running through the darker deposits. Some areas exhibit localized pitting underneath the contamination, looks like the surface was attacked before this layer fully formed. The overall reflectivity is very low, the surface appears matte and absorbs light.

When examining specific zones, the contamination adheres non-uniformly. In some regions, it forms a continuous blanket, while in others it appears as discrete islands. This variation in coverage suggests a complex degradation history, possibly from thermal cycling or chemical exposure. The underlying tungsten grain structure is not visible at all, completely masked by this tenacious film.

  After laser cleaning, the transformation is dramatic. At 500x, the contaminated layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine tungsten substrate beneath. Surface now exhibits a much lighter, metallic gray appearance with a noticeable increase in specular reflectivity. The Ra roughness is reduced to 0.8 µm, a substantial improvement from the initial 3.8 µm.

This cleaned surface, it clearly shows the native polycrystalline grain structure of the tungsten. Individual grains are now visible, with well-defined boundaries and a relatively smooth topography within each grain. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observed—likely remnants of the initial surface attack seen under the contamination—but these features do not compromise the surface integrity. The cleaning process has achieved its primary goal, which is functional restoration.

The evidence of contamination removal is very clear. No dark deposits remain, and the previous cracked-mud pattern is completely absent. XPS analysis confirms
