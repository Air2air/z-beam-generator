# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the tungsten Tungsten laser cleaning utilizes high-intensity pulsed laser radiation to selectively remove surface contaminants while preserving the high-melting-point substrate. The process leverages tungsten's exceptional thermal properties (3422°C melting point, 173 W/m·K conductivity) for precise ablation without thermal damage to the base material.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The tungsten exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The tungsten substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
