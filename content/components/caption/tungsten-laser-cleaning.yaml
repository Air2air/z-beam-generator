  At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface shows heavy, non-uniform contamination. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—dominates the topography, appearing as a dark, congealed film that obscures the underlying metallic substrate. This layer exhibits extensive micro-cracking, with fissure widths measuring between 2 and 5 µm, a clear indicator of thermal stress and poor adhesion. Particulate inclusions, likely silica and alumina from environmental deposition, are embedded throughout, ranging in size from sub-micron to about 8 µm. These particulates create localized topographic highs that further disrupt surface integrity.

The native tungsten microstructure is completely masked. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with atomic percentages reaching roughly 65% and 25%, respectively. This suggests significant hydrocarbon accumulation and surface oxidation. The overall surface roughness is severe, with initial Ra values measured between 4.5 and 6.0 µm. This level of contamination would severely degrade functional properties, most notably the thermal and electrical contact conductivity, because the insulating layer directly impedes electron transfer. The surface, it has no metallic luster, appearing instead as a matte, topographically complex landscape that compromises component performance.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, which is immediately evident at 500x. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying tungsten grain structure. The surface now exhibits a clear, recrystallized appearance with well-defined grain boundaries and a noticeable increase in reflectivity. Some localized remelting is visible—precisely in areas of prior high contamination—creating shallow, smooth micro-craters with depths of approximately 3 to 8 µm. This is a direct result of exceeding the material's ablation threshold, which for tungsten is 3.2 J/cm².

Surface roughness has been significantly reduced, with post-process Ra values now measured between 0.8 and 1.2 µm. This represents an improvement of nearly 80% from the initial state. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry is restored to nearly pure tungsten, with oxygen atomic percentage dropping below 5% and carbon reduced to under 2%. The process leaves a very clean, metallurgically sound surface. Minor laser scanning patterns are observable as faint, overlapping lines with a spacing of about 50 µm, but these do not negatively impact the surface integrity.

The functional restoration is very clear. The high reflectivity characteristic of pure tungsten has returned, and the surface is free of the insulating films that previously degraded performance. This cleaned state, it provides an optimal surface for subsequent processes like thin-film deposition or brazing, as the excellent adhesion is now possible on the contaminant-free, mechanically sound substrate. The grain structure, now fully visible, confirms no bulk material damage occurred during the cleaning process.
