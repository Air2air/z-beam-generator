  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the tungsten metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The tungsten exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The tungsten substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
