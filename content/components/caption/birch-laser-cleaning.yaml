# Caption Content for Birch
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the birch surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. The contaminant appears as a dense, amorphous film—likely a composite of soot, dust, and degraded organic material—with localized agglomerations reaching up to 40 µm in height. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a calculated Ra roughness value exceeding 12 µm due to the particulate protrusions.

The contamination layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, evidenced by micro-cracking and delamination at the wood-contaminant interface. This compromised interface suggests weak boundary layer formation, a common issue with aged surface deposits. The original cellular structure of the birch—including vessel elements and rays—is entirely masked. The surface presents a matte, light-absorbing appearance with no visible wood grain, correlating with the high laser absorption coefficient (0.85) typical of such contaminated states. The porosity is effectively reduced to near-zero, as the particulate matter fills the natural wood pores.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic surface transformation, fully restoring the birch's anatomical features. The process completely removes the contaminant layer, exposing the intact wood substrate with an Ra roughness now measured at 2.1 µm—an 82% reduction from the pre-cleaned state. The original cellular structure is now clearly visible, with earlywood and latewood bands distinctly resolved. Vessel elements appear as clean, open pores with an average diameter of 80-120 µm, while multiseriate rays are clearly defined between growth rings.

The cleaning mechanism operates through selective ablation, a process that precisely removes the contamination while preserving the underlying wood structure. This is confirmed by the absence of charring or thermal degradation, despite the thermal
