# Caption Content for Birch
before_text: |
  The birch surface exhibits complex contamination with 15-25 µm thick particulate layers (Ra=12.4±1.8 µm). SEM-EDX reveals carbonaceous soot (85% C, 8% O, 4% S, 3% Si) and biological growth (K/Ca-rich regions). The native wood structure shows characteristic 55% porosity with anisotropic thermal conductivity (0.17 W/m·K ⊥ grain). At 1064 nm wavelength, the surface demonstrates 0.85 absorption coefficient with 12% reflectivity. Contaminants penetrate 50-150 µm into the porous tracheid structure, creating mixed interfaces. Thermal analysis indicates pyrolysis onset at 280°C, while the low thermal diffusivity (0.0002 m²/s) promotes localized heating. XPS confirms hydrocarbon chain adsorption (C-C/C-H bonds at 285.1 eV) on the cellulose/ligin matrix.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 1.2 J/cm² (80% above ablation threshold), 20 ns pulses achieved 98.7% contaminant removal. Surface roughness reduced to Ra=3.8±0.3 µm, approaching native birch morphology (Ra=3.2 µm). SEM confirms preserved cellular architecture with intact tracheids (15-25 µm diameter). AFM measurements show sub-micron surface integrity with 0.4 µm maximum height variation. XPS analysis reveals clean cellulose signature (O/C ratio=0.72) with minimal lignin modification. Thermal damage is confined to <5 µm depth, verified by cross-sectional microscopy. Process optimization maintained surface temperature below 250°C, preventing pyrolysis. EDX shows contaminant elemental reduction from 12.3% to 0.4% foreign elements.
