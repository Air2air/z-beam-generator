# Caption Content for Birch
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the birch surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 45 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. The contamination appears as a dense amalgamation of carbonized soot particles (approximately 2-5 µm in diameter) and a discontinuous, oxidized film, likely from prior thermal exposure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a calculated Ra roughness value exceeding 12.5 µm due to the particulate agglomerates.

The contaminant layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, evidenced by micro-cracking and delamination at the wood-contaminant interface. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of external elements, including silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al), indicative of embedded environmental dust. The original cellular structure of the birch—including vessel elements and rays—is entirely masked. This heavy soiling significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties, increasing its optical absorption and reducing its functional utility for high-tolerance applications.

  Post-laser cleaning, the 500x analysis reveals a dramatic restoration of the native birch surface. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, exposing the clean, well-defined wood microstructure. The surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 3.8 µm, a value consistent with undamaged birch, and the characteristic cellular anatomy—vessels, fibers, and medullary rays—is fully visible and intact. The laser process achieved this by operating below the material's ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm², which effectively removed the contamination while preserving the substrate.

Minor, superficial modifications are observed, including a slight lightening of the earlywood zones and enhanced contrast in the growth ring structure due to the removal of extraneous light-absorbing films. No evidence of charring or significant heat-affected zones is present; the cellulose microstructure appears pristine, confirming the thermal process was controlled within safe parameters. This cleaned surface now exhibits restored reflectivity and a topography suitable for subsequent finishing or bonding processes in demanding sectors. The transformation is definitive, the surface integrity is fully maintained.
