  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the birch wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The birch exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The birch substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
