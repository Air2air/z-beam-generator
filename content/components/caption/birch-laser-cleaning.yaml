# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the birch Birch wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its cellulose and lignin composition. The 1064 nm wavelength provides effective absorption for controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the underlying wood structure through precise thermal management.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The birch substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
