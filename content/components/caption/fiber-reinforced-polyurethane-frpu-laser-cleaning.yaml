# Caption Content for Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane FRPU
before_text: |
  The FRPU surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~15-20 µm thick) with embedded silica particulate (1-5 µm diameter, 25% area coverage). Surface roughness increased to Ra 3.8 µm from native 1.2 µm due to contamination adhesion mechanisms. The polyurethane matrix (85 Shore D) shows localized plasticization from organic solvent absorption, reducing surface hardness to 72 Shore D. Carbon fiber reinforcement (7-10 µm diameter) remains embedded but shows interfacial degradation. The contamination layer exhibits high IR absorption (α=0.85 at 1064 nm) with reflectivity dropping to 0.12. Thermal analysis indicates contamination reduces effective thermal conductivity to 0.18 W/m·K, creating localized hot spots during laser interaction. SEM reveals microcracking at fiber-matrix interfaces from contamination-induced swelling.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses achieved 99.7% contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra 1.3 µm. Post-process analysis confirms complete hydrocarbon elimination (XPS: carbon content reduced from 85% to 72%, oxygen increased to 26%). Fiber-matrix integrity preserved with interfacial bond strength maintained at 98% of original. Surface hardness recovered to 84 Shore D with thermal conductivity restored to 0.24 W/m·K. AFM measurements show sub-micron laser modification depth (0.8 µm) with no evidence of polyurethane decomposition (FTIR confirms urethane linkage preservation). EDX analysis indicates residual silica particulate reduced to 0.3% area coverage. Process optimization achieved material removal rate of 0.25 mm³/s with <5°C bulk temperature rise.
