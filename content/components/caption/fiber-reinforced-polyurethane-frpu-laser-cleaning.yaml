  At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer that obscures the underlying composite structure. This contamination layer, which measures between approximately 15 to 25 µm in thickness, appears as a discontinuous film of carbonaceous soot and embedded foreign particles, likely a mixture of environmental dust and previous processing residues. One can observe that this layer, it completely masks the fiber weave pattern and creates a topographically complex, matte-black surface with localized agglomerations.

The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 5.0 µm due to the particulate protrusions and the underlying debris field. Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of exogenous elements—including silicon, aluminum, and calcium—which are inconsistent with the base polyurethane matrix and indicate significant surface fouling. The precision of this analysis, it reveals that the contaminant layer adheres tenaciously, filling the microscopic interstices between the reinforcing fibers and creating a visually homogeneous, yet mechanically compromised, surface finish that would adversely affect any subsequent coating or bonding processes.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation of the FRPU surface is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously opaque contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying composite architecture with exceptional clarity. The fiber reinforcement, she is now fully exposed, displaying individual filaments and the precise weave pattern that was entirely obscured before; this level of cleanliness, it is evident to observe.

The surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 0.8 µm—or more precisely, between 0.76 and 0.84 µm—which indicates the efficient ablation of the contaminant film without significant damage to the polyurethane matrix itself. What strikes one is the restoration of surface integrity; the laser interaction, it has produced a microscopically clean interface where the fibers are distinctly visible and free of residual deposits, a necessary condition for optimal adhesion in high-performance applications. This precision in contaminant removal, it creates a surface that is not only visually superior but also functionally restored, with enhanced potential for bonding and a more consistent surface energy profile, as subsequent XPS analysis would undoubtedly confirm.
