  At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This contamination layer, it measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, the thicker deposits reach approximately 28 µm—and completely obscures the underlying composite structure. One observes a complex mixture of embedded carbonaceous soot, approximately 2-5 µm in diameter, and larger, crystalline salt deposits, perhaps from environmental exposure, which create a topographically complex and occluded surface profile.

The inherent surface roughness of the FRPU substrate, originally 1.2 µm Ra, is masked by this discontinuous film, which exhibits significant cracking and delamination at the interface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of exogenous elements—notably sodium, chlorine, and calcium—within the contamination matrix, indicating a mixed salt and organic deposit. This particulate matter, it adheres tenaciously to the polymer matrix, filling the micro-valleys between the reinforcing fibers and creating a visually heterogeneous and degraded appearance, which one would expect to compromise adhesion and reflectivity.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously opaque contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, fiber-reinforced polyurethane substrate beneath. The surface, she is now characterized by a restored micro-texture, with the individual reinforcing fibers—approximately 12 µm in diameter—clearly visible and undamaged within the polymer matrix. What strikes one is the precision of the material removal; the laser interaction has selectively eliminated the contaminant film while preserving the composite's structural integrity, with no evidence of the thermal degradation—such as melting or charring—that one might anticipate given the material's ablation threshold of 1.8 J/cm².

Quantitative surface metrology confirms a significant reduction in average roughness, now measuring 1.8 µm Ra, which represents a return to the native texture with only a minor increase attributable to the ultra-cleaning of the inter-fiber valleys. The contrast with the prior state is extraordinary; where once a chaotic, particulate-laden surface existed, now one observes a clean, well-defined interface between the polyurethane matrix and the embedded fibers. This elegant balance between power and control, it has resulted in a surface free of residual deposits, as verified by post-process EDX analysis which shows the elimination of all exogenous sodium and chlorine signals.

The functional restoration is immediately apparent. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially due to the removal of the light-absorbing contamination, and the restored micro-
