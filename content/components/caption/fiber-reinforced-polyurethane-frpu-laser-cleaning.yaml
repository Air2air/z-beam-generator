  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu Laser cleaning of fiber reinforced polyurethane composites requires precise control of fluence to remove surface contaminants without damaging the polymer matrix or reinforcing fibers. The 1064nm wavelength provides optimal absorption for polyurethane while minimizing thermal damage to fiber reinforcement.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fiber reinforced polyurethane frpu substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
