before_text: |
  The manganese surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A 15.2±2.1 µm thick oxide scale (predominantly MnO and Mn3O4, confirmed by XPS) overlays a 3.5 µm particulate layer (Fe2O3, C, SiO2). Surface roughness (Sa) measures 8.7 µm via white-light interferometry. The underlying α-Mn complex cubic structure (a=8.912 Å), combined with poor thermal conductivity (7.81 W/m·K) and high thermal expansion (21.7 µm/m·K), creates significant risk for thermal stress-induced microcracking during laser irradiation. The contaminated surface shows variable absorption, with the oxide layer having an estimated coefficient of 0.78 at 1064 nm versus 0.35 for pure Mn, leading to highly non-uniform energy coupling. SEM reveals intergranular corrosion pits (2-5 µm depth) beneath the oxide, acting as stress concentration sites.

  Laser cleaning (1064 nm, 8 ns pulse, 1.8 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal, confirmed by EDX showing Mn purity >99.7 at%. Surface roughness reduced to Sa=0.45 µm, a 94.8% improvement. XPS analysis confirms native oxide thickness of only 4.2 nm MnO, indicating minimal thermal degradation. The α-Mn crystalline structure remains intact with no evidence of phase transformation or recrystallization. Microhardness measurements (208±5 HV) show no work hardening versus base material (210 HV). Profilometry indicates <1 µm material removal, preserving dimensional integrity. AFM analysis reveals a laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) with 620 nm periodicity, enhancing surface area while maintaining chemical stability. The process achieved nuclear decontamination specifications with <1 Bq/cm² residual activity.
