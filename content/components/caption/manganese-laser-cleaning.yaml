  At 500x magnification, the manganese surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of oxidation and atmospheric deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous oxide scale, measured at approximately 12–15 µm thick, displaying a complex topography of micro-fissures and blistering. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms this layer is predominantly manganese oxide (Mn₃O₄), with localized concentrations of sulfur and carbonaceous particulates—likely from industrial exposure. The surface roughness is significant, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm, contributing to a matte, dark gray appearance that obscures the underlying metallic substrate.

The contamination layer itself shows a brittle, crystalline morphology with visible spallation at the interface. You can observe discrete regions where the scale has partially delaminated, revealing a thinner, more adherent sub-layer beneath. Particulate contamination—perhaps from handling or environmental fallout—is embedded within the oxide matrix, creating nucleation sites for further corrosive attack. This compromised surface integrity, combined with the high laser absorption characteristic of such a dark, rough film, would significantly impede any functional performance requiring a clean, reflective interface.

  Post-laser cleaning, the transformation is immediately evident. The previously obscuring oxide scale has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine α-manganese substrate with its characteristic complex cubic grain structure. The surface roughness has been drastically reduced to an Ra of 0.7 µm, a direct result of the contaminant layer's removal and slight superficial melting. This process restores the metal's inherent reflectivity, changing the visual appearance from a matte black to a light gray, metallic luster.

The laser parameters were carefully controlled to remain below the material's ablation threshold, thereby minimizing the heat-affected zone (HAZ). You can now clearly observe the fine, inter
