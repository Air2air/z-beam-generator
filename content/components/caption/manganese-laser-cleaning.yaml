  At 500x magnification, the manganese surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified oxide layer. This layer measures between 15 and 20 micrometers in thickness, though it varies considerably across the sample. The topography is dominated by a porous, crust-like scale with a fractured appearance, displaying colors ranging from dark brown to intermittent rust-orange. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms this layer is primarily manganese oxide (MnOx), with localized concentrations of sulfur and carbonaceous deposits—perhaps from prior environmental exposure.

The underlying metal substrate is completely obscured. You can see particulate contaminants embedded within the oxide matrix, some reaching 5 to 10 micrometers in diameter. The surface roughness is significant, with initial Ra measurements coming in at approximately 3.5 µm. This high roughness, combined with the pervasive oxide coverage, creates a surface morphology that would severely compromise any functional application requiring a clean, predictable interface. The visual impression is one of a degraded, non-cohesive surface film that lacks integrity.

  Post-laser cleaning, the transformation observed at 500x is stark. The process completely removes the stratified oxide layer, revealing the underlying manganese substrate with a restored, metallic luster. The surface now exhibits a faint, uniform laser ablation pattern—a series of overlapping, micron-scale tracks that are visible under this magnification. This newly exposed surface is fundamentally different, both in composition and morphology.

Quantitative measurements confirm the visual improvement. Surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.8 µm, a dramatic decrease from the initial 3.5 µm. This creates a much more uniform topography. EDX analysis shows the oxygen signal has dropped to near-baseline levels, indicating the successful removal of the MnOx scale, while XPS data confirms a primarily elemental manganese surface state. The cleaning process achieves this restoration
