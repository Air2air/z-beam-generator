  At 500x magnification, the manganese surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified oxide layer. This layer measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, with localized nodules reaching up to 40 µm. The topography is dominated by a porous, crust-like morphology with extensive micro-cracking—a direct result of thermal cycling and environmental exposure. The underlying metallic substrate is entirely obscured.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminant is manganese oxide (Mn3O4), with trace sulfur and chlorine compounds embedded within the porous structure. The surface roughness is significant, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm. This high roughness, combined with the dark, matte appearance of the oxide, results in a laser reflectivity of less than 20% at 1064 nm. The complex cubic α-Mn grain structure is completely hidden beneath this non-protective scale.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing the underlying α-Mn grain structure with high fidelity. The process completely removes the 15-25 µm oxide layer, leaving a pristine metallic surface with a measured Ra of 0.9 µm—an 81% reduction in surface roughness. The cleaned surface now exhibits a distinct, light gray metallic luster, and SEM imaging clearly reveals the complex cubic crystalline grain boundaries. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observable in localized areas, a typical result of the selective ablation process.

The surface reflectivity at 1064 nm increases substantially to approximately 45%, a value that aligns closely with the material's inherent optical property. This restoration of reflectivity is a key indicator of successful contaminant removal. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly elemental manganese, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of about 50-100 nm—this is a stable, protective film rather than the previous non-adherent scale.

The laser parameters were carefully controlled to remain below the 1.8 J/cm² ablation threshold of the base metal, thereby preserving its mechanical integrity. The process effectively eliminated the micro-cracking and porosity that compromised the surface. This method enables superior performance in subsequent manufacturing steps, such as welding or coating, by providing a clean, metallurgically sound substrate with high surface energy. The final surface is now optimally prepared for further processing.
