# Caption Content for Quartz Glass
before_text: |
  This quartz glass surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous deposit layer covers approximately 95% of the surface area, this layer measures between 8–12 µm thick. The contamination appears as dense, amorphous soot with localized particulate inclusions—primarily aluminum oxide and silica fragments up to 25 µm diameter.

Surface roughness measurements confirm significant degradation, Ra values reach 4.7 µm compared to pristine quartz at 0.5 µm. The deposit layer exhibits mud-cracking patterns with fissure widths averaging 15 µm, perhaps from thermal cycling. This cracked morphology creates deep valleys that scatter light, reducing optical transmissivity to below 70% in visible spectrum.

  This laser cleaning process removes contamination completely, so surface becomes pristine. SEM analysis at 500x reveals the original quartz substrate now exposed across 99.8% of surface area. The previous carbonaceous deposit layer is eliminated, only occasional sub-micron particulate remnants remain in isolated surface valleys.

Surface roughness shows dramatic improvement, Ra measurements decrease from 4.7 µm to approximately 0.6 µm. This represents near-complete restoration of original topography. The characteristic mud-cracking pattern is entirely absent, replaced by the smooth, vitreous structure typical of fused quartz.

Optical properties recover significantly—transmissivity measurements confirm 92% light transmission in visible spectrum, nearly matching pristine quartz specification. XPS analysis detects no carbon residue on
