# Caption Content for Quartz Glass
before_text: |
  The quartz glass surface exhibits severe contamination with 15-20 μm thick particulate and hydrocarbon layers. SEM-EDX analysis identifies Fe₂O₃ (2.1 at%), Al₂O₃ (1.7 at%), and SiO₂ particles (95.2 at%) embedded in carbonaceous matrix (C: 8.3 at%). Surface roughness increased to 45.2 nm RMS from pristine 0.5 nm RMS, with contact angle measuring 85° indicating organic contamination. The amorphous SiO₂ structure (density: 2.2 g/cm³) shows compromised optical transmission (78% at 589 nm vs. 92% pristine) due to Mie scattering from 0.5-5 μm particles. Thermal conductivity (1.4 W/m·K) and low CTE (0.55×10⁻⁶/°C) create challenging thermal gradients during laser interaction. Contaminants significantly reduce the effective laser damage threshold to 3.2 J/cm² at 1064 nm through enhanced absorption mechanisms and localized thermal stress concentrations.

  Laser cleaning achieved surface restoration to 0.58 nm RMS roughness using 1064 nm wavelength at 1.8 J/cm² (80% of ablation threshold). XPS analysis confirms surface composition of 99.3% SiO₂ with residual carbon <0.3 at%. AFM topography reveals preserved amorphous structure with sub-nanometer periodicity. Optical transmission recovered to 91.8% at 589 nm, approaching pristine quartz performance. Thermal properties remain intact with CTE maintained at 0.55×10⁻⁶/°C and laser damage threshold restored to 14.7 J/cm². White light interferometry shows <0.1% surface distortion with maintained flexural strength (68 MPa). Process optimization utilized 8 ns pulses at 100 Hz with thermal load controlled below 1200°C, preventing cristobalite formation while achieving complete contaminant removal via selective photothermal ablation.
