  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartz glass Laser cleaning of fused quartz glass utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove surface contaminants through selective ablation while preserving the substrate's optical properties and surface integrity. The process is particularly effective for removing organic residues, particles, and thin films without chemical residues or mechanical damage.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows optical contamination and surface films adhering to the surface. The quartz glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The quartz glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
