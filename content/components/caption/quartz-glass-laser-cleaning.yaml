# Caption Content for Quartz Glass
before_text: |
  This quartz glass surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous deposit layer covers approximately 85% of the surface area, this layer measures between 5-15 µm in thickness. The deposit appears as a discontinuous film with particulate inclusions—or more precisely—metallic oxide particles embedded throughout.

Surface analysis reveals significant textural degradation. The original polished substrate now exhibits localized pitting and micro-fractures beneath the contamination layer. These features, perhaps from previous cleaning attempts, create adhesion sites that anchor the deposits. The contamination morphology suggests mixed organic and inorganic composition, with visible stratification in cross-section. This complex layer structure severely compromises optical performance and surface integrity.

  This laser cleaning process produces remarkable surface restoration. The quartz glass now exhibits its original vitreous character, with complete removal of the carbonaceous deposit layer. Surface roughness measurements confirm this improvement, showing Ra values of 0.8-1.2 nm—very close to the pristine material specification of 0.5 nm Ra.

The transformation is particularly evident in the elimination of subsurface damage. Micro-fractures observed in the contaminated state are now absent, this indicates the laser parameters were properly calibrated below the ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². The surface shows no evidence of thermal stress cracking or melting, which demonstrates excellent process control.

This method achieves functional restoration while preserving material integrity. The surface now displays characteristic transmissivity—approximately 93% in visible spectrum—and maintains chemical stability. This clean surface condition meets semiconductor manufacturing requirements, with no detectable residue or laser-induced damage features. The process removes contamination completely, so surface becomes optically functional again.
