# Caption Content for Quartz Glass
before_text: |
  This quartz glass surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous film covers approximately 95% of the surface area, this layer measures between 8-12 µm thick. The contamination appears as dark, amorphous deposits that completely obscure the underlying glass structure.

The surface texture is very-very rough, with Ra measurements indicating 1.8 µm average roughness. Particulate matter—primarily silica and aluminum oxides according to EDX analysis—is embedded within the carbon layer. These particles range from 5 to 40 µm in diameter and create significant topographical variation. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion at the interface, with visible delamination at several locations along the glass surface.

  This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface transformation. The carbonaceous film is completely removed, revealing the original quartz substrate with excellent clarity. Surface roughness decreases significantly to 0.2 µm Ra—this represents nearly 90% reduction from the contaminated state.

The glass surface now exhibits minimal particulate residue, perhaps only 2-3 isolated particles per square millimeter remain. These measure under 5 µm maximum. SEM analysis confirms the surface integrity is maintained, with no evidence of micro-fracturing or thermal damage from the laser process. The reflectivity increases substantially, this creates superior optical properties for semiconductor applications.

XPS data shows the surface composition is now 99.7% SiO₂, that matches pristine quartz specifications. The cleaning achieves functional restoration, so the
