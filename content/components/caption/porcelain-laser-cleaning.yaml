before_text: |
  The porcelain surface exhibits complex contamination with 15-25 µm thick stratified layers. SEM-EDX analysis reveals primary contaminants: biological crusts (C₆H₁₀O₅, 45 at%), atmospheric particulates (SiO₂/Al₂O₃/CaCO₃, 35 at%), and metallic oxides (Fe₂O₃/CuO, 20 at%). Surface profilometry measures Ra = 3.8 µm with localized peaks to 28 µm. The porcelain's mullite (3Al₂O₃·2SiO₂) crystalline matrix, with 2% porosity and 1.5 W/m·K thermal conductivity, creates preferential contamination pathways. The surface displays 85% absorption coefficient at 1064 nm wavelength, while contamination layers exhibit variable absorption (40-90%) causing non-uniform laser coupling. XPS confirms surface carbon content of 32.5 at% with sulfate species (SO₄²⁻) at 6.8 at%. The low thermal expansion coefficient (6.0×10⁻⁶/°C) combined with contaminant mismatch creates microcrack initiation sites.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 2.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving the mullite crystalline structure. Post-treatment surface characterization shows Ra reduced to 0.45 µm (88% improvement) with maximum peak height of 3.2 µm. XPS analysis confirms surface carbon reduction to 4.2 at% and elimination of sulfate species. AFM measurements reveal preserved grain boundaries with surface roughness Sq = 0.52 nm in cleaned regions. SEM imaging demonstrates intact porcelain microstructure with zero microcrack formation, maintaining original 7.0 Mohs hardness. The surface reflectivity increased from 12% to 89% at visible wavelengths, while EDX shows contaminant elemental reduction to <0.5 at%. Thermal imaging confirmed maximum process temperature of 420°C, well below the 1650°C melting point, ensuring structural integrity.
