# Caption Content for Porcelain
before_text: |
  This porcelain surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, discontinuous surface film—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the original glaze. This layer consists of particulate matter and carbonaceous deposits, which create a very-very rough texture with localized Ra values measuring 4.8 µm. The underlying vitreous body is almost completely obscured.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high concentrations of sulfur and carbon, this indicates atmospheric pollution deposits. The contamination adheres strongly within surface micro-fissures and the inherent 2% porosity of the porcelain body. The original surface reflectivity is reduced significantly, perhaps to below 10%, because the dark layer absorbs light. This condition is not good for the material's function.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now appears completely different. The contamination layer is removed, so the original vitrified glaze is fully exposed. This process leaves a clean surface with a measured Ra of 0.7 µm—a very good improvement from the initial 4.8 µm.

The glaze microstructure is now clearly visible, showing a homogeneous, glassy phase with minimal subsurface damage. Some isolated, shallow micro-pits—approximately 5 to 10 µm in diameter—remain where tenacious deposits were vaporized. Surface reflectivity increases significantly, perhaps to the material's inherent 15%, because the clean surface scatters light more effectively. This result is very-very good for cultural heritage applications.
