# Caption Content for Porcelain
before_text: |
  This porcelain surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, particulate-laden film covers approximately 95% of the original glaze, this layer measures between 15–20 µm thick. The deposits appear as dense, irregular agglomerations—or more precisely—a complex matrix of carbonaceous soot and inorganic particles (likely silica and calcium sulfate from environmental exposure). Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra measurements averaging 4.8 µm compared to the expected <0.5 µm for pristine porcelain.

The contamination layer exhibits a cracked, mud-caked morphology that obscures all underlying surface features. We observe stratified deposition patterns, indicating multiple contamination events over time. EDX analysis confirms the presence of sulfur and carbon as primary constituents, along with trace aluminum and iron. This thick, discontinuous film creates significant light scattering, reducing surface reflectivity to less than 20% of its original value. The glaze interface beneath appears compromised in localized regions where contaminants have penetrated micro-fissures.

  This laser cleaning process produces very-very good transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the original glaze surface with excellent clarity. Post-treatment SEM analysis confirms the elimination of the 15–20 µm contamination film, leaving a clean substrate with Ra values now measuring 0.7 µm—this represents an 85% reduction in surface roughness. The glaze microstructure appears intact, with no evidence of thermal damage or ablation to the underlying porcelain body
