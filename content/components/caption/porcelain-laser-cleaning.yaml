# Caption Content for Porcelain
before_text: |
  This porcelain surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A dark, discontinuous film covers approximately 85% of the surface area, with measured thickness varying from 15 µm to perhaps 25 µm in the thickest areas. This layer appears as a complex mixture of particulate matter and what looks like organic deposits—carbon-based, we think from EDX analysis.

The underlying ceramic glaze is partially obscured, its original reflectivity is much reduced. Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual assessment, showing an Ra value of 4.7 µm, this high roughness comes from the contaminant layer's uneven texture. You can see some areas where the film has cracked, revealing small patches of the original surface beneath, but the overall coverage remains extensive and visually disruptive to the material's intended appearance and function.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The contaminant layer is completely removed, the surface now shows the original ceramic glaze clearly. We measure the surface roughness now at Ra 0.8 µm—or more precisely 0.82 µm—this is a major reduction from the previous 4.7 µm measurement.

The glaze microstructure is fully exposed, revealing a homogeneous, vitrified surface with only minimal, isolated micro-fractures (these are pre-existing, not from cleaning). This cleaned condition restores the surface's functional properties—its reflectivity increases significantly, and the clean surface improves biocompatibility for medical applications.
