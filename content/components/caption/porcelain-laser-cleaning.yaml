  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the porcelain ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The porcelain exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 99.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The porcelain substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal stress.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
