# Caption Content for Porcelain

  This contaminated porcelain surface shows significant surface degradation at 500x magnification. A thick, discontinuous contamination layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers thick—covers the original glaze. This layer appears as a dark, particulate film composed of carbonaceous soot and inorganic mineral deposits, perhaps from environmental exposure. The surface roughness is very high, with Ra measurements indicating values around 4.8 µm, this creates a matte, light-absorbing appearance.

Analysis reveals the contamination is not uniform. There are localized areas of thicker crust formation, some reaching up to 35 µm, and these areas show micro-cracking. The underlying porcelain glaze is partially obscured, its characteristic vitreous structure is not visible. EDX analysis confirms high carbon and sulfur content, indicating organic soot and sulfate crusts. This dense layer significantly reduces surface reflectivity, the initial reflectivity of 12% is now less than 5%, a very-very poor result for light interaction.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, the result is very-very good. At 500x magnification, the contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the original vitreous glaze beneath. Surface roughness is now significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 0.7 µm—or more precisely—0.68 µm. This creates a smooth, homogeneous finish.

The glaze microstructure is now clearly observable, showing a continuous glassy phase with minimal subsurface damage
