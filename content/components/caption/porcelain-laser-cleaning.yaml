  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the porcelain ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The porcelain exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.
