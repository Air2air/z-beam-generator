# Caption Content for Porcelain
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the porcelain surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a tenacious film, creating a topographically complex and irregular surface. The underlying porcelain's characteristic vitrified, glass-like microstructure is completely hidden.

The contamination exhibits a mixed morphology. Agglomerated particles, ranging from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, are adhered by an amorphous, carbonaceous matrix. This composite layer significantly increases surface roughness, scattering light and giving the area a matte, occluded appearance. The original, smooth ceramic substrate is not visible, indicating thorough coverage by the contaminant.

  Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete transformation. The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic porcelain substrate. The surface now displays the expected vitrified, glass-smooth microstructure, with a significant reduction in measured surface roughness.

The laser process has effectively ablated the contaminant without damaging the underlying ceramic. The original, homogenous surface of the porcelain is fully restored, with its low porosity and high reflectivity evident. This confirms the selective nature of the cleaning, which targeted the ablation threshold of the contaminant while remaining below the damage threshold of the porcelain itself.
