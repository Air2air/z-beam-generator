# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the porcelain Porcelain laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove surface contaminants through selective ablation, leveraging the material's high thermal stability (1350°C melting point) and mechanical hardness (7 Mohs). The process preserves the underlying ceramic structure while removing organic and inorganic surface layers.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows ceramic dust and firing residues adhering to the surface. The porcelain exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The porcelain substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal processing.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
