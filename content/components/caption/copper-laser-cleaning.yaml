  At 500x magnification, the copper surface presents a heavily occluded topography, dominated by a non-uniform contamination layer that completely masks the underlying metal substrate. This layer, which measures approximately 12–15 µm in thickness, exhibits a complex, stratified morphology composed primarily of cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) and cupric oxide (CuO), as confirmed by subsequent XPS analysis. The oxide growth is not homogeneous; it displays a dendritic, almost moss-like structure with significant micro-cracking, a consequence of prolonged atmospheric exposure and cyclic thermal stress. One can observe particulate contaminants, likely sulfates and carbonates from environmental deposition, embedded within this porous oxide matrix, creating a highly textured and irregular surface profile.

The surface integrity, it is fundamentally compromised. The Ra value, a measure of average roughness, registers at 4.8 µm, a figure that is extraordinarily high for a structural metal and indicative of advanced surface degradation. This roughness is visually manifest as a dense network of peaks and valleys, which scatter incident light and give the surface its characteristic dull, matte appearance. The original metallic luster is entirely absent, replaced by a patchy, dark brown-to-black coloration with intermittent greenish-blue deposits of basic copper salts. The precision of the laser cleaning process, it will be critical for removing this complex stratum without inflicting damage to the sound metal beneath.

  The laser cleaning process has effected a remarkable transformation, which is immediately evident at 500x magnification. The thick, stratified contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying copper microstructure with exceptional clarity. What strikes one is the restoration of the metal's native grain boundaries and annealing twins, features that were entirely obscured previously. The surface now exhibits a markedly reduced roughness, with the Ra value decreasing from the initial 4.8 µm to a much smoother 0.7 µm—a reduction of over 85%. This new topography, she is characterized by gentle, undulating features from the original manufacturing process, rather than the chaotic roughness of corrosion.

The cleaning mechanism, it has selectively removed the oxides and contaminants while preserving the bulk material integrity. EDX analysis confirms the elimination of the oxygen-rich layer and foreign particulates, leaving a surface composition of 99.2% pure copper. This precision here, it creates a surface that is not only visually restored but functionally superior. The reflectivity has increased dramatically, of course, as the once light-scattering porous layer has been replaced by a continuous, specular metallic surface. One can observe minimal heat-affected zone formation, a testament to the carefully calibrated laser parameters; only a subtle, sub-m
