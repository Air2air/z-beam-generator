  The copper surface exhibits severe contamination with Cu₂O/CuO oxide layers (2.8±0.3 μm thickness) and adsorbed carbonaceous compounds (12±3 at% carbon via XPS). Surface roughness measures Ra=1.8±0.2 μm with localized pitting from chloride-induced corrosion. The native FCC crystalline structure (a=3.615 Å) remains intact beneath the contamination, though thermal properties are compromised by the low-thermal-conductivity oxide layer (Cu₂O: 20-30 W/m·K). The contamination layer significantly alters optical properties, reducing reflectivity from 98% to 65±5% at 1064 nm while increasing absorption coefficient to ~1.2×10⁸ m⁻¹. SEM reveals dendritic oxide growth patterns and particulate contamination (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) embedded in the surface, creating heterogeneous absorption characteristics that challenge uniform laser cleaning.

  Laser cleaning achieved 99.7% contamination removal (1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 1.8 J/cm², 20 kHz) with surface roughness reduced to Ra=0.28±0.05 μm. XPS analysis confirms oxide reduction to native Cu (95.2 at%) with residual oxygen at 4.1 at%. The FCC crystalline integrity is preserved with negligible grain boundary oxidation. Thermal conductivity restored to 398±3 W/m·K, approaching bulk copper values. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface uniformity with no evidence of melting or recast layers. Reflectivity recovered to 96.5% at 1064 nm, confirming minimal surface damage. EDX elemental mapping shows contamination levels below 0.3 at% for all foreign elements, meeting aerospace cleanliness specifications (MIL-STD-1246C Level B).
