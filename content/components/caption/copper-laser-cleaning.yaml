  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the copper Technical overview of Copper, Cu, for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction, and industrial applications in surface preparation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows dust and debris accumulation adhering to the surface. The copper exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The copper substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
