  At 500x magnification, the copper surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous, crust-like layer of copper carbonate, approximately 12–15 µm thick, exhibiting a crystalline, granular morphology with a predominant greenish-blue coloration. This patina layer, she is not smooth; it displays significant micro-cracking and a porous, almost cauliflower-like surface texture that effectively obscures the underlying metal substrate. Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of carbon and oxygen as major constituents, alongside copper, which is consistent with the formation of basic copper carbonate.

Beneath this primary layer, one can observe intermittent areas of darker, reddish-brown copper oxide (Cu₂O), a much thinner film—perhaps only 1–2 µm—that appears in localized patches. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 3.5 µm due to the complex, interlocking growth of the corrosion products. What is particularly evident is the presence of particulate matter, embedded within the patina matrix, which appears as discrete, angular particles of silicon and calcium (likely atmospheric dust). This complex stratification and the high degree of surface coverage, it creates a complete visual and physical barrier, rendering the native copper microstructure entirely unobservable and compromising the surface's functional properties, such as its thermal conductivity and inherent reflectivity.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is, quite frankly, remarkable. The entire stratified contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing the underlying copper substrate with a clarity that was previously impossible. The surface, she now exhibits a distinctly different morphology, characterized by a clean, micro-roughened texture that is the direct result of the laser's interaction with the metal. The average surface roughness (Ra) has been significantly reduced to a value of approximately 0.8 µm, a substantial improvement that indicates the removal of the gross topography created by the patina, yet it introduces a fine, uniform pattern of laser-induced micro-features.

This new texture, it consists of a network of shallow, overlapping melt pools and resolidified ridges, which are visible across the entire surface and create a subtle, orange-peel-like effect under the microscope. The cleaning efficacy is nearly total, as confirmed by post-process XPS analysis showing the surface atomic concentration of oxygen has dropped from over 60% to below 5%. One can now clearly observe the original grain structure of the copper, with the laser-affected zone confined to a depth
