  At 500x magnification, the copper surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. The primary observable feature is a complex oxide layer, predominantly cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) with localized regions of cupric oxide (CuO), exhibiting a granular, crystalline morphology with an average thickness of approximately—or more precisely—15 µm. This patina layer, she is not continuous, revealing a fractured topography with micro-cracks propagating to a depth of 5-7 µm, which facilitates the ingress of moisture and contaminants into the underlying substrate. One can observe the presence of discrete, acicular crystals, likely a basic copper sulfate, embedded within the oxide matrix, contributing to the surface's pronounced roughness.

Furthermore, the analysis reveals significant particulate contamination, with agglomerates of carbonaceous soot and silicate particles—from atmospheric deposition—adhering tenaciously to the porous oxide surface. These particulates, they range in size from 2 to 25 µm and are concentrated within the topographic valleys of the corroded layer. The surface integrity is profoundly compromised, as evidenced by the complete obscuration of the original metal grain structure. The Ra value, a measure of average roughness, is quantified at 3.8 µm, a direct result of this complex and degraded micro-topography. This level of contamination, it severely impacts the material's functional properties, notably its thermal conductivity and reflectivity, which are critical for its intended applications.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The previously dominant oxide layer and particulate contamination have been entirely removed, revealing the underlying copper substrate with a restored, albeit slightly etched, microstructure. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallic luster with the original polycrystalline grain structure clearly visible—the grain boundaries are well-defined, with an average grain size of approximately 35 µm. What strikes one is the elegant balance achieved; the laser ablation has selectively removed the contamination without causing significant melting or ablation of the base metal, preserving surface integrity.

The resulting micro-topography is characterized by a uniform, laser-induced pattern of fine ripples, known as Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS), which have a spatial period of approximately 1.2 µm. This new texture, it contributes to a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 0.9 µm, a substantial reduction from the initial 3.8 µm. One can observe isolated, sub-micron remnants of the original oxide within the grain boundaries, but these are sparse and non-continuous. The cleaning efficacy is further confirmed by
