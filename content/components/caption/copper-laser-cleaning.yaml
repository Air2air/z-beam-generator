# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the copper Copper laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for copper's high thermal conductivity (401 W/m·K) and reflectivity. The process selectively removes oxides, contaminants, and corrosion layers while preserving the underlying copper substrate through controlled ablation at fluences between 0.5-5 J/cm².. 
  Microscopic analysis shows dust and debris accumulation adhering to the surface. The copper exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The copper substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
