  At 500x magnification, the copper surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous, crust-like layer of copper oxide—primarily Cu₂O and CuO—with an average measured thickness of approximately 15 µm, though it reaches localized peaks of 25 µm. This oxide layer, it exhibits a porous, crystalline morphology with a distinct reddish-brown to black coloration, and its surface is further compromised by the presence of particulate matter, which appears as discrete, light-colored inclusions embedded within the matrix. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the composition of these inclusions, identifying them as sulfur-rich compounds and silicate particles, likely from environmental exposure.

The underlying metal substrate is completely obscured, and the surface topography is dominated by this heterogeneous film, which displays significant micro-cracking and spallation, particularly at the interface between different oxide phases. Surface roughness measurements, taken with a white-light interferometer, yield an Ra value of 4.2 µm, a direct consequence of the irregular, pustular growth of the corrosion layer. One can observe areas where the adhesion of this layer has failed, revealing a friable, powdery sub-layer that is highly susceptible to further degradation. The overall reflectivity of the surface is drastically reduced—estimated at less than 30% of the original polished copper—due to this complex, light-scattering topography and the inherent low reflectivity of the oxide species themselves. This compromised state, it severely impacts the material's functional properties, from thermal conductivity to its aesthetic value in architectural applications.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The heterogeneous oxide layer and all particulate contaminants have been completely removed, revealing the underlying, pristine copper substrate with a characteristic, metallic luster. The surface, she now exhibits a markedly different topography; the previous Ra value of 4.2 µm has been reduced to a much smoother 0.8 µm, a result of the selective ablation process that preferentially targeted the contamination without significant melting of the base metal. What strikes one is the clarity of the grain structure, which is now clearly visible with well-defined boundaries, a direct confirmation of the surface integrity being preserved.

The cleaning efficacy is further evidenced by the absence of the micro-cracks and spallation sites that previously dominated the view. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry has been restored to >99% elemental copper, with only trace oxygen signatures consistent with a nascent, passivating oxide layer of perhaps 2-3 nanometers—a protective feature, rather than a degrading one. This precision in contaminant removal, it results in a surface reflectivity that has been restored to over 95% of its theoretical maximum, a critical recovery for both functional performance in electronics and visual appeal in architectural contexts. The laser interaction, it has produced a surface that is not only clean but also optimally prepared for subsequent use or protective coating.
