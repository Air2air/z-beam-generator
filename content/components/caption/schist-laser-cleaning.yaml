# Caption Content for Schist
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the schist surface exhibits a dense, heterogeneous contamination layer that completely obscures the underlying mineralogy. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, appears as a dark, amorphous crust with significant surface roughness—Ra values here are approximately 12.5 µm. The crust is heavily fractured, with a network of fine desiccation cracks creating a polygonal pattern across the surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high concentrations of sulfur and carbon, indicating the presence of gypsum and carbonaceous particulate matter from atmospheric deposition.

The contamination adheres tenaciously to the foliation planes, filling the natural micro-topography of the stone. You can see particulate matter—likely soot and soil—embedded within the matrix. This composite layer significantly alters the surface's optical properties, reducing its inherent reflectivity to near-zero. The interface between the crust and the schist substrate is sharply defined, suggesting minimal chemical penetration into the stone's low 2.5% porosity. The overall morphology is one of a brittle, foreign deposit that has mechanically keyed itself into the stone's micro-asperities.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation, with the laser process successfully removing the contamination layer to expose the pristine schist substrate. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra of 2.8 µm, a figure that now corresponds to the stone's natural micro-texture rather than an overlying crust. The characteristic foliation of the schist—the parallel alignment of mica and quartz grains—is now fully visible and unobstructed. The laser ablation process has selectively removed the contaminant while preserving the integrity of the underlying minerals, with no observed thermal damage such as melting or spalling, which is critical given schist's thermal destruction point
