# Caption Content for Schist
before_text: |
  The schist surface exhibits severe anthropogenic contamination with a 45±5 µm thick crust composed of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O), carbonaceous particulates (15-20 vol%), and iron oxide deposits (Fe₂O₃/FeOOH). SEM-EDX analysis reveals contamination penetration to 80 µm depth within foliation planes due to schist's anisotropic porosity (1.8%). Surface roughness measures Ra=18.3 µm (profilometry) with localized biofilm colonization in mica-rich zones. The heterogeneous mineralogy (muscovite/biotite/quartz) creates differential absorption at 1064 nm wavelength, with biotite domains (absorption coefficient 0.62) acting as thermal sensitizers. Contaminant crust displays 94% laser energy absorption versus 45% for clean schist, creating ablation threshold variations from 1.8-3.2 J/cm² across mineral boundaries. AFM phase imaging shows compromised intergranular cohesion near contaminated foliation planes.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 2.1 J/cm² fluence, 40 kHz rep rate) achieved 99.7% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra=2.8 µm. SEM confirms intact foliation microstructure with <0.5 µm ablation depth in quartz domains versus 1.2 µm in mica layers. XPS analysis shows surface composition restored to base schist stoichiometry (Si:Al:Fe = 42:28:8 at%) with residual carbon <0.3 at%. Thermal damage is limited to <5 µm HAZ, verified by micro-Raman showing preserved crystallinity in biotite (FWHM=12.8 cm⁻¹ vs 12.5 cm⁻¹ native). Optical profilometry measures 98% reflectance recovery at 550 nm. The process achieved Class 2 cleaning per ICRCM standards with ablation rate of 0.35 m²/h at 65% laser efficiency, preserving the schist's Young's Modulus (65 GPa) and thermal stability.
