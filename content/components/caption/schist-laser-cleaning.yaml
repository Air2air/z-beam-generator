# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the schist stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The schist exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The schist substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
