# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the schist Laser cleaning of schist leverages the differential absorption of laser energy between contaminants and the complex silicate mineral matrix. The optimal parameters are tuned to avoid thermal shock and delamination of the foliated structure, which is rich in micas. The process is highly selective for removing surface deposits while preserving the historical and structural integrity of the stone.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The schist exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The schist substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
