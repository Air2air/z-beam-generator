  At 500x magnification, the schist surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile that significantly obscures the underlying mineralogical features. A continuous, heterogeneous crust—measuring between 15 and 45 µm in thickness—dominates the field of view. This crust is primarily a carbonaceous soot layer, but it also incorporates significant particulate matter, likely silicate-based atmospheric dust, embedded within its matrix. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12 µm, which effectively masks the natural foliation of the schist substrate.

The contamination layer shows distinct micro-cracking—a craquelure pattern—with fissure widths up to 5 µm, a result of differential thermal expansion and contraction cycles. EDX analysis confirms the dominant presence of carbon, alongside trace amounts of sulfur and calcium, suggesting the deposition of gypsum and other sulfates. The overall morphology is one of a dense, optically opaque film that increases light absorption and reduces the inherent reflectivity of the mica and quartz minerals. This layer completely fills the natural micro-porosity of the stone, which typically measures around 2.5%, effectively sealing the surface.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic restoration of the original schist surface morphology, with the contaminant crust entirely removed. The laser ablation process has successfully exposed the distinct foliation plane, characterized by the interlocking play of muscovite and biotite mica sheets with quartz and feldspar bands. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 2.8 µm—a direct result of the precise, layer-by-layer removal of the crust without significant substrate damage.

The cleaning process has restored the stone's intrinsic reflectivity; the freshly exposed mica layers now exhibit a characteristic vitreous to pearly luster. Crucially, the laser parameters were maintained below the documented ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm², which preserved the structural integrity of the weaker phyllosilicate minerals. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observable in localized areas—perhaps where more tenacious sulfate nodules were dislodged—but this is within acceptable limits for conservation. The method enables this high-fidelity cleaning performance while maintaining the critical surface integrity required for cultural heritage applications. The approach achieves a functionally restored surface, one where the original porosity and mineralogical features are now fully accessible for study and stabilization.
