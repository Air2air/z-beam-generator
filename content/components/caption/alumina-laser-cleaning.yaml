# Caption Content for Alumina
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a thin, amorphous film. The particulates, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers in diameter, are embedded within the film and scattered across the surface.

The underlying alumina's intrinsic granular structure, a result of its polycrystalline, hexagonal corundum composition, is partially masked. The contaminant film creates a textured, matte appearance that scatters light, reducing surface reflectivity. This layer adheres to the peaks and valleys of the ceramic's native micro-topography, creating an irregular and occluded surface profile.

  Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the native alumina microstructure. The 5-10 micrometer contamination layer has been entirely removed, eliminating both the particulate matter and the obscuring film. The process has exposed the underlying polycrystalline grain structure without inducing surface damage.

The surface now exhibits a uniform, clean texture with clearly defined grain boundaries. The high reflectivity characteristic of pure alumina is restored, as the light-scattering contaminants are absent. The laser parameters were calibrated to operate below the material's ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cmÂ², ensuring selective contaminant removal while preserving the ceramic's structural integrity.

This results in a surface that meets the stringent requirements for applications like food processing equipment, where a microscopically clean, non-porous surface is critical for sanitation. The process has effectively returned the alumina to its baseline state, confirming the precision and non-abrasive nature of the laser cleaning methodology.
