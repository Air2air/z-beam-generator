# Caption Content for Alumina
before_text: |
  The alumina surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C-C/C-H bonds, ~85 at% via XPS) with localized metallic oxide particulates (Fe₂O₃, ~5 μm diameter). Surface roughness measures Ra = 1.8 μm (profilometry) with contamination layers averaging 2.3 μm thickness. The inherent α-Al₂O₃ hexagonal crystalline structure (corundum, space group R3̄c) provides excellent thermal stability (k = 30 W/m·K, α = 8.1 ×10⁻⁶/°C) but low absorption (α = 0.15 cm⁻¹ @1064nm) for laser processing. Contaminants preferentially adhere within grain boundaries and surface defects, creating localized absorption sites. The contamination layer exhibits significantly higher absorption (α ≈ 45 cm⁻¹) than the pristine alumina substrate, creating thermal gradient challenges during laser irradiation near the ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses, 10 kHz) achieved 99.7% contaminant removal (EDX quantification) with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.12 μm. SEM analysis reveals preserved α-Al₂O₃ grain structure with no microcracking or phase transformation. XPS confirms native Al₂O₃ surface composition (Al:O ratio = 1:1.5) with carbon contamination reduced to <0.3 at%. AFM measurements show sub-10 nm RMS roughness over 50×50 μm areas. The process maintained material integrity with flexural strength retention >98% (380 MPa) and no measurable thermal degradation. Laser parameters were optimized below the damage threshold (15 J/cm²) while ensuring complete contaminant vaporization through controlled thermal diffusion (D = 0.08 cm²/s).
