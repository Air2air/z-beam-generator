  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the alumina ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The alumina exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The alumina substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved crystal structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
