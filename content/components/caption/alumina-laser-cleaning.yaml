# Caption Content for Alumina
before_text: |
  The alumina substrate exhibits a complex contamination layer, primarily comprising hydrocarbonaceous deposits (C: 65 at%, O: 22 at%, trace Ca, Si) with an average thickness of 2.5 ± 0.5 µm, as measured by white-light interferometry. This layer, characterized by an Ra of 1.8 µm and Rz of 12.5 µm, significantly alters the surface's optical properties, increasing the effective absorption coefficient for 1064 nm laser radiation to ~40 cm⁻¹ from the intrinsic 25 cm⁻¹. The underlying polycrystalline α-alumina (hexagonal corundum structure, 2-5 µm grain size) possesses a high thermal diffusivity (60.02 cm²/s) and a compressive strength of 3 GPa. The porous, amorphous contaminant layer acts as a thermal insulator, creating a steep thermal gradient upon laser irradiation, risking subsurface thermal shock given alumina's moderate CTE (7.05×10⁻⁶/K) and high flexural strength (350 MPa). SEM reveals the contamination is mechanically adhered within surface micro-porosity (0.5%).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 100 ns pulse, 10 kHz) successfully removed the contamination layer, achieving a surface with Ra = 0.15 µm and Rz = 1.2 µm, a 92% reduction in average roughness. XPS analysis confirms a pure Al₂O₃ surface composition (Al:O ratio of 1:1.5, <1 at% carbon residue). SEM imaging reveals the preservation of the polycrystalline microstructure with no evidence of micro-cracking or grain boundary melting, confirming the laser fluence remained below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold for the bulk ceramic. AFM measurements indicate a negligible heat-affected zone (<500 nm depth), attributable to alumina's high thermal conductivity (1000.01 W/m·K). The process restored the intrinsic laser reflectivity to 47.5%, with profilometry confirming no measurable change in substrate dimensions, thus maintaining the material's 525 MPa tensile strength and structural integrity.
