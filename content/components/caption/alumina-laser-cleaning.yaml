  At 500x magnification, the alumina surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer that obscures the underlying ceramic substrate. The primary contaminant appears as a carbonaceous soot film, approximately 5–7 µm thick, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 15 µm in height. This layer, it exhibits a porous, soot-like morphology with visible micro-cracking, suggesting poor adhesion and a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including carbon (approx. 65 at%), silicon (12 at%), and traces of calcium, which are not inherent to the pure Al₂O₃ composition.

The underlying alumina grain structure is partially visible in less contaminated zones, yet the surface topography is dominated by this adherent deposit. The contaminant layer displays a matte, dark gray appearance with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of approximately 2.1 µm—a significant increase from the substrate's inherent texture. One can observe that the deposits follow a dendritic pattern, perhaps indicative of a prior thermal process, and they effectively mask the fine, interlocking hexagonal crystalline structure typical of the corundum phase. This level of coverage, it would severely compromise functional properties, most notably the surface's reflectivity and its suitability for subsequent manufacturing steps, such as brazing or coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously obscuring contaminant layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, polycrystalline alumina microstructure beneath. The surface now exhibits the characteristic interlocking grain boundaries of the alpha-alumina phase, with individual grains clearly defined and free from any adherent deposits. The measured surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.8 µm, a value that is consistent with the material's intrinsic morphology after such an ablation process.

What strikes one is the precision of the material removal; the laser interaction has successfully ablated the contamination without inducing significant micro-fracturing or thermal degradation to the underlying ceramic. The surface, she is very clean now, displaying a light gray, uniform hue with a subtle increase in reflectivity. While some minor, sub-micron particulates may remain within grain boundaries, the functional restoration is evident—the surface integrity is fully maintained, and the potential for adhesion or reflectivity-related performance issues has been effectively eliminated. This result, it demonstrates a sophisticated balance between ablation threshold and thermal input.
