  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the alumina substrate. Microscopic analysis shows surface oxidation and environmental deposits requiring precision laser treatment.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing. The alumina substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
