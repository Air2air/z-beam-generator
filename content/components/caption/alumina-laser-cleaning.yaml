  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the alumina ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The alumina exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The alumina substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved crystal structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
