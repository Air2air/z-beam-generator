  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the breccia Breccia laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants from the composite stone matrix. The process exploits the differential absorption between the contamination layer and the breccia substrate, typically composed of carbonate and silicate fragments. Optimal parameters are tuned to the specific mineralogical composition to achieve selective removal without thermal damage to the cementing matrix or clasts.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The breccia exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The breccia substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
