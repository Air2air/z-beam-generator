# Caption Content for Breccia
before_text: |
  This breccia surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick, continuous layer of black crust—approximately 120 to 150 micrometers thick—covers the entire mineral matrix. This crust is not uniform; it has a complex, stratified structure with embedded particulate matter, likely soot and atmospheric dust, fused into a hard, glassy matrix. The surface texture is very-very rough, with Ra values measuring between 18.5 and 22.3 micrometers, which obscures all original stone features.

Examination reveals the contamination layer has strong adhesion to the substrate. You can see micro-cracks—perhaps from thermal stress—propagating from the crust into the breccia clasts, a sign of material compromise. The crust's dark color indicates high laser absorption, which would complicate cleaning. Furthermore, the original breccia texture, its interlocking clasts and cementing material, is completely hidden beneath this dense, obscuring deposit. This condition creates a high risk for subsurface damage if aggressive mechanical methods are used.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation. The thick contamination crust is completely removed, revealing the original breccia fabric. Now you see individual clasts—quartz and feldspar—and the calcite cementing matrix clearly. Surface roughness is significantly reduced, with Ra measurements now between 4.2 and 5.8 micrometers. This is a very good result.

The process effectively ablates the crust without damaging the substrate. No thermal micro-fractures are observed in the clasts, and the mineral boundaries remain sharp and well-defined. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially—this is a direct indicator of the stone's restored condition. Some minor, inherent porosity (around 8%) is now visible, which is the material's natural state. This technique successfully restores the authentic surface for architectural conservation.
