  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the breccia stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The breccia exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 95.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The breccia substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal expansion.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
