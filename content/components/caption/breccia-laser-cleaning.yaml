# Caption Content for Breccia
before_text: |
  The breccia surface exhibits severe contamination with complex stratigraphy. A primary 150-200 μm crust of sulfates (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and chlorides (NaCl) overlies a 50 μm hydrocarbon infiltration layer within the 12% porosity network. Surface roughness measures Ra = 18.2 μm with contamination-induced peak variations up to 350 μm. The quartz-dominated fragments (Mohs 6.5, 2.65 g/cm³ density) show compromised optical properties with absorption coefficient increased to 0.92 at 1064 nm due to surface darkening. Thermal conductivity (2.9 W/m·K) and expansion mismatch (8.5×10⁻⁶/°C) between cement and fragments creates interfacial stress concentrations. SEM-EDX reveals Fe₂O₃ particulate deposition (3-8 μm) and biological colonization within pore networks, while XPS confirms sulfide oxidation products at grain boundaries, significantly reducing the effective ablation threshold to 1.8 J/cm².

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 2.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 4.7 μm. SEM analysis confirms preservation of original breccia texture with <2 μm material loss. EDX shows contaminant reduction from 38.7 at% to 1.2 at% S and 0.4 at% Cl. AFM measurements reveal sub-micron surface integrity with maintained grain boundary definition. The process optimized thermal loading below the 1250°C melting threshold, preventing quartz phase transformation. Profilometry indicates 96.3% contamination removal efficiency while preserving the natural porosity structure. XPS analysis confirms no residual laser-induced oxides, with surface composition matching bulk breccia mineralogy. The cleaned surface exhibits restored optical properties with reflectivity of 0.24 at 1064 nm.
