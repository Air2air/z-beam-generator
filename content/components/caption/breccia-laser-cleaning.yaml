# Caption Content for Breccia
before_text: |
  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, a complex stratigraphy is visible, with a discontinuous soot and particulate layer approximately 15–20 µm thick—or more precisely, 17.3 µm in the thickest areas—overlying a more tenacious gypsum crust. The underlying breccia texture is completely obscured. This crust, a result of sulfate deposition, exhibits a crystalline morphology with needle-like structures and fills the natural porosity of the stone (which is typically around 8%).

The particulate layer consists of carbonaceous soot agglomerates and mineral dust, creating a highly irregular surface topography. Initial surface roughness measurements indicate an Ra value of approximately 12.5 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent roughness. This contamination layer shows poor adhesion in some regions, leading to micro-cracking and spalling at the interface. The dark deposits, which we analyzed with EDX, show high carbon and sulfur content, confirming the organic and sulfate-based nature of the soiling. This thick crust masks the natural color and clast-matrix contrast of the breccia, so the original surface features are not visible at all.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination layer, so the original breccia surface is now fully exposed. The transformation is very-very clear. The previous 17 µm crust is completely absent, revealing the intricate breccia fabric with its distinct clasts and cement
