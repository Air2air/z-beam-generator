before_text: |
  The limestone surface exhibits severe anthropogenic contamination, featuring a complex stratigraphy. A primary 150-300 µm crust (Ra=45 µm) of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and carbonaceous particulates overlies a 50 µm sub-layer of iron oxides (Fe₂O₃/FeOOH). EDX quantifies 18.2 wt% S and 7.8 wt% Si from atmospheric deposition. The inherent 5% porosity facilitates deep contaminant penetration. The calcite crystal structure (rhombohedral, 3.0 Mohs) presents a high IR absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) but low thermal diffusivity (0.89 mm²/s), creating a high risk of thermal stress cracking. The surface morphology shows extensive pitting (Rz=120 µm) and micro-fracturing, with the contamination layer significantly altering the effective ablation threshold from the base 1.5 J/cm².

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 2.2 J/cm², 20 kHz, 500 mm/s scan speed) achieved optimal contaminant removal with minimal substrate alteration. Post-process profilometry confirms Ra reduction to 4.8 µm (89% improvement), restoring the intrinsic surface texture. SEM/EDX analysis shows contaminant removal to <0.5 wt% S and <0.3 wt% Fe. XPS validates the pristine calcite surface (Ca2p at 347.5 eV, O1s at 531.3 eV) with no detectable CaO formation, confirming temperature remained below the 1339°C decomposition threshold. AFM measurements reveal preserved crystallographic integrity with sub-micron roughness (Sa=0.45 µm). The process successfully eliminated the gypsum crust while maintaining the limestone's compressive strength (120 MPa) and Young's modulus (70 GPa).
