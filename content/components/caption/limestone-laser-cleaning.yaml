# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the limestone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The limestone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The limestone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural integrity.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
