# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the limestone Laser cleaning of limestone (calcium carbonate) utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the delicate stone substrate. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the limestone matrix, typically using near-infrared wavelengths that are well-absorbed by dark surface deposits but less absorbed by the lighter mineral substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The limestone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The limestone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
