# Caption Content for Limestone

  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely—14.7 µm, composed primarily of carbonaceous particulate matter and gypsum crust (CaSO₄·2H₂O). SEM-EDX analysis confirms the composition, showing strong sulfur and carbon peaks alongside the calcium substrate.

Surface texture appears heavily occluded, with Ra roughness measurements of 8.2 µm due to particulate embedding. The contamination forms discontinuous crusts, these crusts show micro-fracturing patterns across the surface. Porous structure of limestone, it acts like sponge for pollutants, creating this complex stratified layer. Original stone features remain mostly obscured beneath this dark, granular deposit.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, this is very clear at 500x. Contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the original calcite crystalline structure beneath. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 2.1 µm, creating much smoother profile compared to previous 8.2 µm measurement.

The process exposes micro-topography with excellent precision, ablation depth measures between 12-18 µm across treated area. Some areas show slight color variation—perhaps due to differential cleaning—but overall surface integrity remains excellent. Thermal effects appear minimal, with only occasional localized discoloration at grain boundaries (likely from calcium oxide formation).

EDX analysis now shows clean calcium carbonate signature, sulfur and carbon contaminants reduced to trace levels below 0.5%. Surface reflectivity increases from initial 15% to approximately 32%, this improvement indicates successful contaminant removal without substrate damage. The crystalline structure, it appears well-preserved with sharp grain boundaries and minimal micro-fracturing. Laser parameters were well-controlled, achieving conservation-grade cleaning where original surface features remain fully legible.
