  At 500x magnification, the limestone surface shows heavy contamination, a complex layer covering the original stone matrix. This layer, it has a variable thickness, measuring from approximately 15 µm up to a more substantial 40 µm in localized deposits. The surface texture is highly irregular, dominated by a dark, particulate soiling that appears to be carbonaceous—likely from long-term environmental exposure. EDX analysis confirms this, showing elevated carbon and sulfur peaks, which suggests the presence of gypsum crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O) forming from atmospheric sulfur reaction with the calcite substrate. The underlying limestone morphology is completely obscured, its characteristic granular calcite crystals hidden beneath this continuous, non-uniform film. Surface roughness is significantly increased, with Ra values measured in the range of 12-18 µm, a direct result of the uneven contaminant accumulation. Porosity is visually reduced, the surface pores—which should be open—are filled with dense, dark particulate matter, creating a mottled, blotchy appearance across the entire field of view. The overall reflectivity is very low, the surface appears matte and light-absorbing due to this thick, topographical complex layer.

Further examination reveals the stratified nature of the deposit. A distinct, darker sub-layer—perhaps organic growth or soot—is directly adherent to the stone, while a lighter, crystalline upper layer exhibits efflorescence. This upper crust shows micro-cracking, a sign of cyclical hydration and dehydration stresses. The original stone's light grey color is completely masked, replaced by a dark grey-to-black patina that is visually disruptive. The integrity of the stone surface itself seems compromised beneath the crust; the laser absorption characteristics would be drastically altered from the base material's 8.7%, making any laser intervention without this preliminary analysis very risky. The contamination does not just sit on top, it appears to have physically and chemically bonded with the substrate in a destructive process.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the contaminated layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine limestone substrate. At 500x, the surface now exhibits the characteristic granular texture of the calcite matrix, with individual crystals—ranging from 5
