  This contaminated gold surface shows significant surface degradation at 500x magnification. A thick contamination layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers—covers the substrate completely. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film with a rough, textured morphology that obscures the underlying metal's reflectivity. The surface roughness is high, with Ra measurements indicating values around 2.5 to 3.0 µm. EDX analysis confirms this layer consists primarily of carbonaceous deposits and sulfur compounds, perhaps from atmospheric exposure or handling residues.

The contamination is not uniform, it shows a patchy distribution with some areas having thicker accumulation. You can see micro-cracking in the thicker zones, this suggests poor adhesion to the gold substrate. The original surface finish is completely hidden, the gold's characteristic luster is absent. This condition would severely impact functional performance, reducing reflectivity—perhaps to below 70%—and compromising any intended electrical or optical properties. The surface is not suitable for high-precision applications in this state.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits the characteristic bright, reflective quality of pure gold. At 500x magnification, the contamination layer is completely removed, this reveals the original substrate with a measured surface roughness now reduced to approximately 0.8 to 1.2 µm Ra. The surface shows minimal heat-affected zone, only slight grain boundary delineation is visible in some areas—
