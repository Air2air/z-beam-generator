  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the gold metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The gold exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The gold substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
