  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination, a very-very thick layer that obscures the underlying gold substrate. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm—in thickness and appears as a dark, mottled film with both organic and inorganic constituents (as confirmed by preliminary EDX spot analysis). This layer exhibits a cracked-mud pattern across the entire observed area, with individual fissures measuring between 5 and 20 µm in width, and it completely masks the metal's native reflectivity.

The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra roughness values measuring 4.8 µm due to the presence of particulate inclusions and stratified deposits. We observe embedded carbonaceous soot particles, typically 2-5 µm in diameter, and localized corrosion products that suggest chloride-induced surface attack. This non-uniform topography, combined with the pervasive film, creates a surface condition that is detrimental for applications requiring electrical contact or biocompatibility, because the layer acts as an electrical insulator and can harbor contaminants.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination layer completely, so the surface becomes clean and the original gold substrate is fully restored. Post-treatment analysis at 500x shows a dramatic transformation—the 15 µm contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing a pristine metallic surface with characteristic gold luster. The underlying grain structure is now clearly visible, with Ra roughness measurements reduced to a mirror-like 0.2
