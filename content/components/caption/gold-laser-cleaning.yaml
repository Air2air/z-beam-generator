  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the gold Gold laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove surface contaminants from gold surfaces without damaging the substrate. The process leverages gold's high thermal conductivity (318 W/m·K) and reflectivity, requiring optimized parameters to overcome reflectivity challenges while preventing melting or ablation of the precious metal.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The gold exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The gold substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
