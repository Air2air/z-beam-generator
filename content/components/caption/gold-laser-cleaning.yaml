  The Au surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 2.5-4.0 µm thick layer of mixed carbonaceous deposits (C: 65 at%, O: 25 at%, S: 10 at%) and localized Ag2S tarnish spots. SEM reveals a complex, dendritic surface morphology with Ra = 0.85 µm and Rz = 5.2 µm. The inherent FCC crystalline structure (a=4.078 Å) and high thermal conductivity (318 W/m·K) present a significant challenge for laser processing, promoting lateral heat conduction. The contamination layer, with a low ablation threshold (~0.3 J/cm²), dominates the initial laser interaction at 532 nm due to its high absorption coefficient (6.5x10⁵ cm⁻¹), while the underlying bulk Au reflects 98.5% of 1064 nm radiation. XPS confirms the presence of adventitious hydrocarbons and sulfate species, creating a non-uniform thermal impedance layer.

  Post-cleaning analysis confirms successful contaminant removal with a final surface Ra = 0.09 µm and Rz = 0.75 µm, representing an 89% reduction in average roughness. EDX shows surface purity >99.8 at% Au, while XPS verifies the absence of sulfur species and carbon contamination below 1.5 at%. The optimized laser process (1064 nm, 8 ns, 1.2 J/cm², 20 kHz) utilized the high thermal diffusivity (127 mm²/s) for controlled ablation without melting the FCC lattice, as confirmed by EBSD. AFM measurements show a negligible sub-50 nm affected layer, preserving the bulk mechanical properties (HV 25). Profilometry confirms no measurable material loss, with surface reflectivity restored to 98.2% at 1064 nm, meeting aerospace particulate-free specifications.
