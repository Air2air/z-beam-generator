  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination. A thick, discontinuous film—approximately 8 to 12 µm in total thickness—covers the underlying gold substrate. This layer appears as dark, amorphous patches intermixed with crystalline deposits, likely sulfides and chlorides from atmospheric exposure. Surface roughness is high, with Ra measurements indicating values around 2.1 µm, this creates a matte, non-reflective appearance that obscures the metal's intrinsic luster.

The contamination layer shows clear delamination at the edges, with some areas revealing the gold beneath. EDX analysis confirms the presence of sulfur, chlorine, and carbon, these elements form a complex, stratified structure. The original gold grain boundaries are completely obscured by this adherent crust. This condition severely compromises the surface for functional applications, the high reflectivity is lost under this opaque covering.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits its original metallic character. At 500x magnification, the contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing a clean gold substrate with a measured Ra of just 0.15 µm. The surface shows a distinct textural change, with a uniform pattern of fine, resolidified micro-droplets—each approximately 1-2 µm in diameter—indicating localized melting and rapid quenching from the laser energy input.

The underlying polycrystalline structure is now fully visible, with well-defined grain boundaries and a restored, highly reflective finish. SEM analysis confirms the absence of sulfur and chlorine, only pure gold elements are detected. This cleaned surface possesses excellent functional properties, the reflectivity is restored to nearly 95 percent, a very-very good result for subsequent manufacturing steps. Some minor laser patterning is visible, but this does not affect the surface integrity, the process removes contamination effectively.
