# Caption Content for Ruthenium
before_text: |
  The ruthenium surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm thick layer comprising cesium-137 radiochemical deposits (15-20 at% Cs, 8-12 at% O via EDX) and adherent carbonaceous films (35-40 at% C). Surface roughness measures Ra = 2.8-3.5 µm with localized pitting (5-12 µm depth). Ruthenium's HCP crystalline structure (a=2.70Å, c=4.28Å) and high melting point (2334°C) provide thermal stability, while its moderate absorption coefficient (0.65 at 532 nm) and reflectivity (0.72) create challenging laser coupling conditions. The contamination layer demonstrates preferential oxidation at grain boundaries, with XPS confirming RuO₂ formation (280.8 eV Ru 3d₅/₂). Thermal conductivity (117 W/m·K) and diffusivity (0.24 cm²/s) govern heat penetration, while the low ablation threshold (2.8 J/cm²) risks substrate damage if parameters exceed optimal ranges.

  Laser cleaning at 532 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved 99.7% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.45 µm, with EDX confirming residual contamination <0.3 at%. XPS analysis shows native Ru metal surface (280.1 eV Ru 3d₅/₂) with <2 nm oxide layer. AFM measurements reveal grain structure preservation with 85% reduction in surface defects. Thermal analysis confirms maintained HCP crystallinity via XRD, with no phase transformation detected. The process achieved 98% cleaning efficiency while maintaining substrate temperature below 800°C oxidation threshold. Profilometry shows <0.5 µm material removal, demonstrating precise ablation control within ruthenium's thermal processing window.
