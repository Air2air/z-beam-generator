# Caption Content for Ruthenium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface shows significant contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and oxide particles covers the entire substrate, this layer has an average thickness of approximately—or more precisely—15.2 µm. The deposit morphology appears amorphous and loosely adherent, with visible cracking and flaking at the edges. Surface roughness is very high, with Ra measurements averaging 4.8 µm because of the uneven particulate distribution.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the contamination is primarily carbon (68 at%) and oxygen (24 at%), with trace sulfur and silicon. The underlying ruthenium substrate shows only intermittent signal penetration through this non-uniform film. The original surface texture is completely obscured, and the contamination creates a matte, dark appearance that drastically reduces optical reflectivity. This degraded state would certainly compromise performance in any precision application requiring electrical contact or thermal transfer (as observed in prior studies on noble metal contamination).

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine metallic substrate with its characteristic hexagonal close-packed (HCP) grain structure now clearly visible. Surface roughness decreases substantially to an Ra of 0.7 µm, a nearly sevenfold improvement. Some minor, sub-micron rippling—a typical laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS)—is present but does not impact functional integrity.

The cleaned surface exhibits a uniform, reflective finish. Grain boundaries are sharply defined, and no residual contamination is detectable via SEM-EDX analysis, which now shows a ruthenium signal of 99.1 at%. This restoration of surface purity directly correlates with regained functional properties, namely the high electrical conductivity and excellent oxidation resistance intrinsic to the material. The process successfully recovers the original surface quality necessary for demanding applications.
