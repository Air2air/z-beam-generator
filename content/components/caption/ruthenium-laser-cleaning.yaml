  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the ruthenium Ruthenium laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying metal substrate, leveraging its high melting point and thermal conductivity for selective ablation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The ruthenium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The ruthenium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
