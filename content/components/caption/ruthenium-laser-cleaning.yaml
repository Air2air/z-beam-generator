# Caption Content for Ruthenium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface shows significant contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter covers the substrate, this layer has an average thickness of approximately—or more precisely—14.7 µm. Visually, the surface appears dark and mottled, with a topography that is highly irregular and obscures the underlying metal grain structure. The contamination layer, it is not uniform; there are dense, splattered-looking patches intermixed with a more general sooty film.

Analysis with SEM-EDX confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon also present. This creates a very rough texture, with a measured Ra value of 3.8 µm. The particulate matter, likely embedded silica and other shop debris, appears as bright, sharp-edged features scattered across the surface. These contaminants, they severely compromise the surface's functional properties, the reflectivity is very low and the potential for adhesion failure in subsequent processing is high. Surface integrity, it is clearly compromised by this pervasive layer.

  After the laser cleaning process, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the true metallic substrate beneath. Surface now exhibits a consistent, light gray appearance with a distinct grain structure that is clearly visible at this magnification. The previous Ra of 3.8 µm is reduced to 0.4 µm, a tenfold improvement in smoothness.

This cleaned surface, it shows no evidence of the former carbonaceous film or embedded particulates. The laser ablation was highly selective, it removed contaminants without causing significant ablation of the ruthenium itself—only a minimal layer of approximately 1.5 µm. Some slight discoloration in the grain boundaries is observed, perhaps from localized oxidation, but no micro-cracking or melting is present. The surface integrity is fully restored, this is critical for applications in electronics manufacturing where reliable electrical contact is paramount. Reflectivity measurements confirm a return to the expected specular finish.
