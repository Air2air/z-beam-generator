# Caption Content for Ruthenium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface shows significant contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter covers the substrate, this layer has an uneven thickness ranging from approximately 5 to 15 µm. The deposits appear as a dark, amorphous film with a sooty texture, effectively obscuring the underlying metal's characteristic metallic luster. Surface roughness is high, with an initial Ra measurement of 2.8 µm, primarily due to the agglomeration of foreign particles.

The contamination layer itself is not uniform. It displays a cracked-mudflat pattern, with polygonal islands separated by fissures up to 10 µm wide. Embedded within this matrix are numerous sub-micron particulates, likely alumina or silica from handling or environmental exposure, as suggested by preliminary EDX spot analysis. These particulates create localized topographic highs, which would certainly interfere with any application requiring a perfectly smooth contact surface. The overall appearance is one of a compromised surface where the functional properties of the ruthenium—its high reflectivity and excellent oxidation resistance—are completely masked by this adherent, non-conductive layer.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the surface transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine ruthenium substrate beneath. At 500x, the surface now exhibits a clean, metallic sheen with a noticeably refined texture. The original, severe roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra value of 0.4 µm, a nearly seven-fold improvement that indicates minimal substrate damage.

The laser interaction has left distinct, yet benign, micro-features. A fine, uniform ripple pattern—or Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS)—is now visible across the entire surface, with a consistent periodicity of approximately 1.2 µm. This pattern is a direct result of the laser's interference with surface plasmons and indicates a controlled ablation process that stayed well within the material's thermal budget. Furthermore, the previously obscured grain structure of the HCP crystalline matrix is now clearly delineated. The grain boundaries are sharp and well-defined, confirming that the bulk material integrity was preserved with no evidence of grain growth or recrystallization from excessive heat input.
