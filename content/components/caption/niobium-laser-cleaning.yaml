  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the niobium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The niobium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 98.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The niobium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
