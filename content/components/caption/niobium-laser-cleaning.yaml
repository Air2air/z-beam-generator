# Caption Content for Niobium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the niobium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified oxide layer measuring between 8 and 15 µm in thickness. This layer, it exhibits a complex topography of micro-fissures and blister-like protrusions, indicative of a non-protective, porous scale that has spalled in several regions. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are niobium pentoxide (Nb₂O₅) and adventitious carbonaceous deposits, the latter forming a discontinuous film of approximately 1–2 µm. The underlying metal interface, where visible through the cracks, shows signs of pitting, with pit depths measured at up to 5 µm.

The surface texture is dominated by this friable, crystalline oxide which displays a dull, matte grey appearance with intermittent regions of yellowish interference coloring. The roughness, quantified by a profilometer, is significantly elevated with an Ra value of 4.2 µm and an Rz of 28.5 µm, a direct consequence of the uneven layer delamination and particulate entrapment. One can observe the original machining marks from the substrate, they are entirely obscured by this adherent, yet mechanically unsound, contamination layer that compromises the material's intrinsic surface properties, including its reflectivity and potential for subsequent processing or coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously thick, stratified oxide and carbonaceous film have been completely removed, revealing the pristine, metallic niobium substrate beneath. The surface now exhibits a noticeably different morphology, characterized by a subtle, wavy pattern of laser scan tracks—or more precisely, a laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS)—with a feature amplitude of only 0.8 to 1.2 µm. This newly exposed surface possesses a markedly lower roughness, with Ra values now measured between 0.4 and 0.6 µm.

The visual contrast is stark; the matte, fractured pre-cleaning topography has been replaced by a uniform, metallic-grey surface with a satin-like finish. The laser ablation process has effectively eliminated the micro-fissures and pits, restoring surface integrity without evidence of significant melting or recast layer formation, which is a critical achievement given the material's high melting point. This precision, it results in a surface that is not only visually clean but also functionally restored, as confirmed by the return of high reflectivity and the creation of an ideal, contaminant-free interface for any subsequent application, be it in medical implants or superconducting magnets.
