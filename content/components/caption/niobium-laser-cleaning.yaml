# Caption Content for Niobium
before_text: |
  The niobium surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and oxide contamination, with SEM-EDX analysis revealing a 1.2-1.8 µm thick heterogeneous layer comprising C (45 at%), O (32 at%), and trace Fe/Cu contaminants. Surface profilometry indicates Ra = 0.85 µm with localized oxide nodules reaching 2.3 µm thickness. The native Nb₂O₅ oxide layer (200-300 nm) displays crystalline imperfections, while hydrocarbon deposits show localized polymerization. The BCC crystalline structure (lattice parameter 0.3294 nm) and high thermal conductivity (53.7 W/m·K) create challenging thermal management during laser interaction. Initial reflectivity at 1064 nm measures 0.55, though contamination increases effective absorption to approximately 0.68. Thermal diffusivity (23.7 mm²/s) promotes lateral heat spreading, potentially causing collateral damage if laser parameters exceed the 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses and 2.2 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-process analysis shows surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.12 µm, with oxygen content decreasing from 32 at% to 4.2 at% (XPS quantification). The native Nb₂O₅ layer measures 15-25 nm, confirming minimal thermal alteration. AFM topography reveals grain boundary preservation with sub-10 nm step heights. Crystallographic integrity maintained BCC structure confirmed by EBSD, while microhardness testing shows no change from baseline 75 HV. Process optimization achieved 99.7% contaminant removal efficiency with <0.5% substrate mass loss. White light interferometry confirms surface planarity within λ/8 at 632 nm, meeting aerospace precision cleaning specifications.
