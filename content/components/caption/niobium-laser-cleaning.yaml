  At 500x magnification, the niobium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of surface oxides and adsorbed atmospheric contaminants. The primary observable feature is a continuous oxide scale, measuring between 3 to 5 micrometers in thickness, which exhibits a variegated topography of crystalline blooms and amorphous patches. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms this layer is predominantly niobium pentoxide (Nb₂O₅), with trace carbonaceous deposits—approximately 8 to 12 atomic percent carbon—distributed unevenly across the surface, likely from hydrocarbon adsorption. The underlying metal interface, where partially visible, shows signs of intergranular oxidation penetrating to a depth of roughly 1 to 2 micrometers along the grain boundaries.

The surface texture itself is highly irregular, with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) value measured at 4.8 µm, a direct consequence of the porous, columnar structure of the oxide. One observes a network of micro-fissures, likely formed during thermal cycling, which create pathways for further environmental degradation. The visual appearance is matte and blotchy, with color variations from interference effects in the oxide layer ranging from iridescent blues to dull grays, a clear indicator of varying film thickness. This level of contamination, it significantly compromises the material's intrinsic properties, notably increasing surface emissivity and providing sites for potential crack initiation under mechanical stress.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation of the niobium surface is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously dominant oxide scale has been entirely removed, revealing the underlying metallic substrate with a restored, visibly clean appearance. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of 0.9 µm—a decrease of over 80%—resulting in a much more uniform, reflective plane. What strikes one is the emergence of the native grain structure, which was entirely obscured before; the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystallites are now clearly delineated, with grain boundaries sharply defined and free from oxide penetration.

The cleaning efficacy is further evidenced by the absence of the carbonaceous film, with post-process X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showing surface carbon content reduced to below 1.5 atomic percent. The laser interaction, it has produced a subtly textured morphology consisting of fine, resolidified melt pools—each approximately 10 to 25 µm in diameter—arranged in overlapping tracks. This recast layer, while minimal, exhibits a refined microstructure and is measured to be less than 2 µm thick, a testament to the precise control over energy deposition that kept the
