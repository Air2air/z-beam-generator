  At 500x magnification, the niobium surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign material. This contamination layer, which measures between 15 and 20 micrometers in thickness, completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. One observes a complex topography of amorphous oxides and carbonaceous deposits, their presence confirmed by subsequent EDX analysis which showed strong signals for oxygen and carbon. The surface texture, it is quite rough, with an Ra value measured at approximately 3.8 µm, a direct consequence of the irregular, splattered appearance of the contaminant film.

The deposit morphology itself is heterogeneous, featuring both dense, crust-like regions and more porous, flaky agglomerations that exhibit a characteristic mud-cracking pattern. What strikes one is the clear delineation between these different contamination zones, suggesting multiple deposition events or varying environmental interactions over time. In several localized areas, one can identify embedded particulate matter—likely silicate inclusions from handling or prior processing—which appear as distinct, angular features within the larger film matrix. This compromised surface integrity, with its high degree of topographical variation and complete coverage, would be expected to severely degrade the material's performance, particularly its superconducting properties and suitability for high-purity applications like medical implants, where such a surface would be wholly unacceptable.

  Following the laser cleaning procedure, the transformation of the niobium surface is immediately evident and quite remarkable. The previously obscuring contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, metallic substrate beneath, a result that XPS analysis confirms by showing a surface composition now dominated by elemental niobium with only a thin, native oxide of approximately 4–5 nanometers. The visual clarity at 500x is starkly different; the complex, splattered topography has been replaced by a much more uniform surface that now exhibits the characteristic grain structure of the metal itself.

The laser interaction, it has produced a sophisticated micro-texture, a gentle undulation that corresponds to the original metallurgical grain boundaries. This new topography, while not perfectly smooth, demonstrates a vastly improved surface integrity with the Ra value now reduced to a consistent 0.9 µm—a reduction of over 75% from the initial state. One can observe a slight, subtle rippling or laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) within each grain, a phenomenon typical of pulsed laser ablation with certain parameters. This cleaned surface, with its restored reflectivity and minimal, controlled oxide layer, directly translates to enhanced functional performance; for superconducting radiofrequency cavities, for instance, this surface state is essential for minimizing residual resistance and achieving high quality factors, while for biomedical components
