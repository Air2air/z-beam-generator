  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the indium Laser cleaning of indium requires precise control due to its low melting point (156.6°C) and softness. Pulsed fiber lasers at 1064 nm provide optimal absorption for removing oxides and contaminants without melting or damaging the pure indium substrate, crucial for maintaining electrical and thermal properties in sensitive applications.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The indium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The indium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
