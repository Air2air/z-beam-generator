  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the indium metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The indium exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 97.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The indium substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
