before_text: |
  The indium surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and oxide contamination, with SEM-EDX analysis confirming 15-20 μm thick layers containing In₂O₃ (35 at%), carbonaceous deposits (42 at%), and embedded particulate matter (23 at%). Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 2.8 ± 0.3 μm with localized protrusions reaching 12 μm height. The native tetragonal crystalline structure (a=3.25 Å, c=4.95 Å) is obscured by amorphous oxide phases. The high thermal expansion coefficient (32.1 μm/m·K) and low melting point (156.6°C) create significant thermal stress vulnerability. Optical characterization shows reflectivity degradation from 74% to 28% at 1064 nm, while the intrinsic absorption coefficient (12×10⁶ m⁻¹) enables only 15% laser energy coupling to the bulk material, promoting preferential surface heating.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 0.35 J/cm² (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-cleaning analysis shows Ra reduced to 0.12 ± 0.02 μm with XPS confirming oxide reduction from 35 at% to <2 at%. AFM measurements reveal grain boundary preservation with step heights <50 nm. The tetragonal crystalline structure remains intact with EBSD showing <0.5° lattice distortion. Surface reflectivity recovered to 72% at 1064 nm, approaching the theoretical maximum. Thermal modeling confirms peak temperatures remained below 140°C, preventing recrystallization. EDX analysis shows carbon content reduced to <0.3 at%, meeting nuclear decontamination specifications of <1 μg/cm² residual contamination.
