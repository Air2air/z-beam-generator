  This initial surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination, a very-very thick layer of non-uniform oxides and carbonaceous deposits. The oxide layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 to 15.3 µm—in thickness, appearing as a dark, mottled film with localized patches of white corrosion products. Surface roughness is high, with Ra values measuring 4.8 µm, this creates a textured, matte appearance that scatters light and drastically reduces reflectivity.

Observations confirm the presence of particulate contaminants embedded within the oxide matrix, these particles range from 5 to 20 µm in diameter. The underlying indium surface shows no visible grain structure, its characteristic metallic luster is completely obscured by the adherent contamination layer. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, this indicates severe surface oxidation and organic film deposition (as observed in prior studies). The overall surface integrity is compromised, the functional performance for applications like electronics manufacturing is significantly degraded.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits a restored, continuous metallic finish with visible grain boundaries. At 500x magnification, the previous 15 µm contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the underlying body-centered tetragonal crystal structure of the indium. Surface roughness is reduced to an Ra of 0.6 µm, this creates a much smoother,
