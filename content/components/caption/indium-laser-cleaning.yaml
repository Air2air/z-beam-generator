  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated indium surface. A thick, discontinuous oxide layer covers the substrate, this layer measures approximately 2.5 to 3.5 micrometers in thickness. The oxide appears as a dark, mottled film with a crust-like texture, it shows extensive micro-cracking and some areas exhibit blisteringâ€”likely from thermal stress during prior processing. The surface is very-very rough, with visible particulate contamination embedded within the oxide matrix.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are carbon and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and chlorine also present. These elements form a complex, non-uniform layer that completely obscures the underlying metal's reflectivity. The Ra surface roughness measurement is high, registering at 1.8 micrometers, this creates significant topographical variation. You can see the contamination follows a dendritic pattern in some regions, perhaps from some liquid phase interaction, and this irregular coverage suggests poor adhesion for any subsequent coating or bonding process. The overall appearance is one of a degraded, non-functional surface that requires intervention.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits a clean, metallic appearance with restored reflectivity. The previous oxide layer is completely absent, this removal exposes the underlying indium grain structure with high clarity. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the elimination of carbon and oxygen signals that dominated the initial EDX spectrum, the
