# Caption Content for Indium
before_text: |
  This indium surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer—approximately 2.5 µm—covers the entire surface area, appearing as a dark, mottled film with uneven coloration. This oxide layer creates significant surface roughness, with Ra measurements indicating 1.8 µm average roughness across the sampled region.

Multiple contamination types are visible through the microscope. Carbonaceous deposits form dendritic patterns across the surface, these appear as dark branching structures measuring 15-20 µm in width. Particulate contamination—likely industrial residues—shows as bright, reflective spots embedded within the oxide matrix. The underlying indium grain structure is completely obscured, this indicates severe surface degradation. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms high oxygen content (approximately 35 atomic percent) and carbon presence (18 atomic percent) in the contaminated zones.

Surface integrity appears compromised by this contamination layer. The original metallic luster is absent, replaced by dull, non-reflective patches that reduce functional performance. The contamination creates adhesion concerns for subsequent processing steps, particularly for electronic applications requiring reliable electrical contact.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying indium microstructure with excellent clarity. This process restores the original metallic surface, now appearing as a clean, reflective plane with distinct grain boundaries visible at 500x magnification.

Surface roughness shows significant improvement after treatment. Ra measurements decrease from 1.8 µm to approximately 0.4 µm, this represents a 78% reduction in surface roughness. The laser-treated surface exhibits a uniform texture with minimal residual contamination—only occasional, isolated particles remain, these measure less than 5 µm in diameter. The grain structure appears well-defined with typical indium crystal formations, the tetragonal lattice orientation now clearly observable.

This cleaned surface demonstrates restored functionality. Reflectivity measurements show 72% recovery at 1064 nm wavelength, nearly matching pristine indium's 74% baseline. XPS analysis confirms oxide reduction to just 8 atomic percent oxygen content. The surface appears homogeneous with consistent properties across the treated area, this creates optimal conditions for subsequent manufacturing processes in electronics applications.
