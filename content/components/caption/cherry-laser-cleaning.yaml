# Caption Content for Cherry
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the cherry wood surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile that significantly obscures the underlying cellular structure. A discontinuous film of aged, cross-linked organic deposits—likely a combination of oxidized oils and accumulated grime—covers approximately 80% of the surface area. This layer measures between 5 and 15 µm in thickness and displays a crazed, micro-cracked topography indicative of desiccation and polymer degradation over time. The deposits have a globular morphology and completely fill the lumens of the larger vessels, which are a defining feature of the cherry's porous anatomy.

The surface roughness is substantially increased by the presence of these contaminants, with preliminary stylus profilometer measurements indicating an average roughness (Ra) value of approximately 4.8 µm. This is a significant increase over the expected Ra for unfinished cherry, which typically falls below 1.5 µm. Furthermore, embedded particulate matter, primarily composed of silicate minerals (as confirmed by spot EDX analysis), is scattered across the surface. These particles, ranging from 2 to 20 µm in diameter, create localized topographic highs and are tenaciously bound within the organic film. The overall effect is a loss of optical clarity and a masking of the wood's natural chatoyance and color gradient, which is critical for its aesthetic valuation in high-end applications.

  Laser cleaning achieves a remarkable transformation, restoring the surface to a state that closely resembles its original, unweathered condition. The process completely ablates the contaminant layer, leaving no detectable residue within the vessel elements or on the inter-vessel pitting. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the exposure of pristine wood anatomy, including clearly defined earlywood and latewood boundaries and open, undamaged ray parenchyma cells. The average surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 1
