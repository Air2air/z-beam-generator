  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the cherry Laser cleaning of Cherry wood utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove surface contaminants while preserving the natural wood structure. The 1064nm wavelength provides optimal absorption by lignin and cellulose components, enabling controlled ablation of finishes without thermal damage to the underlying wood substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The cherry substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
