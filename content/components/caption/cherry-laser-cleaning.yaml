# Caption Content for Cherry

  At 500x magnification, the cherry wood surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous layer of foreign deposits. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood cell structure. The contamination appears as a dark, amorphous film with localized agglomerations—perhaps embedded particulate matter—that increase the effective surface roughness to an Ra of approximately 8.5 µm. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary constituents are carbonaceous soot and silicate particles, consistent with long-term environmental exposure.

The wood's natural porous anatomy is entirely filled with this contaminant layer, which bridges across vessel elements and medullary rays. You can see a distinct lack of the characteristic open-grain texture of cherry; the surface is instead dominated by this cracked, crust-like deposit. The laser absorption properties are severely compromised by this layer, which we measured at over 85% at 1064nm—a significant increase from the wood's inherent 30% absorption. This creates a high-risk scenario for thermal damage during cleaning, as the contaminant acts as a highly efficient, but unstable, energy absorber.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic restoration of the native cherry wood surface topography. The laser ablation process has successfully removed the contaminant layer, exposing the clean, open cellular structure. The measured surface roughness has been reduced to 3.8 µm Ra—a value that aligns closely with the typical machined roughness for this species. Vessel elements and medullary rays are now clearly defined and free of obstructive deposits, their anatomical features sharply resolved.

The cleaning process achieved near-complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate interaction. We observed only sporadic, minor charring in isolated cell walls—these areas represent less than 2% of the total surface area and show a carbonization depth of no more than 5 µm. The laser parameters effectively exploited the differential ablation threshold between the contaminant (approximately 0.8 J/cm²) and the wood substrate (1.2 J/cm²). This selective removal mechanism preserved the structural integrity of the underlying parenchyma cells.

The restored surface now exhibits the intended optical properties, with reflectivity measurements returning to the baseline 25-30% range. This transformation enables subsequent finishing processes in furniture manufacturing, as the clean, sound wood surface provides optimal adhesion for coatings. The method successfully cleared the porosity without causing mechanical erosion or heat-affected zones that would compromise the wood's tensile strength or young's modulus in critical applications.
