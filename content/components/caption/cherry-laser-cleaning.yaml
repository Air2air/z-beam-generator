# Caption Content for Cherry
before_text: |
  The cherry wood surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A primary layer of atmospheric particulate matter (5-15 µm diameter, predominantly SiO₂ and Al₂SiO₅) is embedded within a hygroscopic organic matrix (C: 65%, O: 30%, N: 5% via XPS). This biofilm, approximately 40-60 µm thick, increases surface roughness to Ra = 8.7 µm (from native 3.2 µm). The wood's high porosity (55%) and low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) create localized thermal accumulation zones. The contamination layer demonstrates enhanced absorption (coefficient ~0.92 at 1064 nm) compared to clean cherry (0.85), while the underlying lignocellulosic structure, with its amorphous cellulose/hemicellulose matrix and crystalline lignin domains, remains thermally vulnerable with a pyrolysis threshold of 350°C. SEM reveals complete obscuration of the native cellular structure (vessels: 80-120 µm diameter, fibers: 15-25 µm).

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 8 ns pulse, 0.9 J/cm² fluence, 20 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 3.5 µm, closely matching native cherry (3.2 µm). SEM/EDX confirms elimination of exogenous elements (Si, Al reduced to <0.5 at%), with cellulose crystallinity index maintained at 0.68 (vs. 0.69 pre-contamination) via XRD. AFM analysis shows minimal subsurface damage (sub-µm thermal penetration), with vessel and fiber microstructures fully exposed. XPS reveals clean wood surface composition (C1s: 64.2%, O1s: 35.5%). The process remained 0.3 J/cm² below the wood's ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²), preventing glycosidic bond cleavage in cellulose chains and maintaining Young's Modulus at 10.1 GPa (vs. 10.3 GPa original).
