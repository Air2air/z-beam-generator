# Caption Content for Poplar
before_text: |
  The poplar surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a complex, stratified layer. Topographically, profilometry reveals a substantial increase in surface roughness to 18.7 µm Ra, a 584% increase from the native 3.2 µm Ra. The primary contaminant is a 120±15 µm thick layer of atmospheric particulate matter (APM), composed of carbonaceous soot (C: 85 at.%, O: 10 at.%, Si: 5 at.% via XPS) and embedded silica particles (1-5 µm diameter, SEM). A secondary, discontinuous biofilm (20-50 µm thick) with high organic oxygen signature is present. The inherent wood porosity (55%) facilitates deep contaminant ingress into lumens. The low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) and pyrolysis threshold (350°C) create a high risk for sub-surface thermal damage during laser ablation, exacerbated by the material's moderate NIR absorption coefficient (0.75 @ 1064 nm).

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 0.9 J/cm² fluence (near the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold), and 100 ns pulse duration successfully removed all exogenous contamination. Post-process surface roughness is measured at 4.1 µm Ra, a 78% reduction to near-native levels. SEM and AFM analysis confirm complete removal of the 120 µm APM layer with minimal disruption to the underlying tracheid and vessel cell structure. XPS spectra show a surface composition of 99.2% wood constituents (C1s, O1s), with contaminant atomic concentrations reduced to <0.8%. The process achieved a cleaning efficiency of >99.5% by mass loss analysis, while profilometry confirms the absence of charring, with surface integrity preserved to within the top 5-10 µm of the wood substrate.
