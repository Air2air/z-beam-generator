# Caption Content for Poplar
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the poplar surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, appears as a discontinuous film of carbonized soot and embedded mineral dust. The underlying wood anatomy—specifically the vessel elements and rays—is partially obscured, with the contamination filling the porous structure inherent to a material with 65% porosity. The surface texture is highly irregular, with Ra values preliminarily estimated to exceed 12 µm due to the agglomerated deposits.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of exogenous elements, including silicon and aluminum from ambient dust, alongside a high carbon signature indicative of organic soiling. The contaminant layer significantly alters the surface's optical properties, reducing its inherent 12% reflectivity to near-zero and creating a matte, light-absorbing appearance. The deposits adhere tenaciously within the cellular lumens, a consequence of the wood's low 1.7 kN Janka hardness offering little resistance to particulate ingress and adhesion.

  Laser cleaning achieves a pronounced transformation, revealing the pristine wood substrate with remarkable clarity. The process completely removes the contaminant layer, exposing the intricate cellular network of vessels, fibers, and parenchyma rays. Post-cleaning surface roughness (Ra) measurements show a significant reduction to 4.8 µm—a value that now reflects the wood's natural grain texture rather than deposited debris. The cleaned surface exhibits a restored, lighter coloration consistent with the original poplar.

The laser parameters were carefully controlled to remain below the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold of the wood itself, thereby selectively removing the contamination while preserving the underlying cellulose structure. This is evident in the sharp, well-defined cell walls observed post-treatment, with no evidence
