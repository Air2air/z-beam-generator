# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the poplar Laser cleaning of Poplar (Populus spp.) utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to achieve controlled ablation of surface layers. The process exploits the differential absorption between the contaminants and the lignocellulosic wood substrate, enabling precise, layer-by-layer removal without the use of chemicals or abrasive media that can damage the soft wood fibers.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The poplar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
