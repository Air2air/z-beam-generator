# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the poplar wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The poplar exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.4% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The poplar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
