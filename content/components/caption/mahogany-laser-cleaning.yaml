# Caption Content for Mahogany
before_text: |
  The mahogany surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratigraphy. A 150±25 µm thick layer of particulate carbon (85% C, 8% O, 4% Si, 3% Ca by EDX) from combustion deposits overlays a 50±10 µm degraded wood layer with compromised cellular structure. Surface roughness measures Ra=18.7 µm, Rz=125 µm via white-light interferometry. The inherent porosity (45%) facilitates deep contaminant penetration into vessel elements and lumens. Mahogany's low thermal conductivity (0.14 W/m·K) and thermal diffusivity (0.13 mm²/s) create significant thermal management challenges. The high absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm) promotes excessive energy coupling, while the low ablation threshold (1.2 J/cm²) risks thermal degradation below the contamination layer. SEM reveals complete occlusion of pit membranes and ray parenchyma by contaminants, severely impeding laser-substrate interaction dynamics.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra=3.2 µm, Rz=28.5 µm, representing 83% improvement. XPS analysis confirms surface composition of 72% C, 27% O, 1% Si - approaching pristine mahogany chemistry. AFM measurements show exposed cellular structure with intact vessel elements (80-150 µm diameter) and minimal cell wall damage. Thermal penetration depth calculated at 15±5 µm, well below the 300°C decomposition threshold. SEM confirms preservation of pit membranes and middle lamella structure. Optical profilometry indicates <2 µm material loss from original surface, demonstrating precise ablation control. The cleaned surface exhibits enhanced laser reflectivity (0.38 at 1064 nm) due to exposed lignocellulosic microstructure.
