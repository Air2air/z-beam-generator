# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mahogany wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The mahogany exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The mahogany substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
