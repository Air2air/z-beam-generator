# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the mahogany wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The mahogany exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mahogany substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
