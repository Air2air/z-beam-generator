  At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile. A continuous, amorphous soot layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This carbonaceous deposit appears as a dense, black film with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 8.5 µm, creating a highly irregular topography that completely masks the wood's cellular structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary composition is carbon (85%), with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon, likely from environmental particulate matter.

Beneath this primary layer, a discontinuous biofilm adheres tenaciously to the wood cell walls. This biological growth, perhaps fungal hyphae or microbial colonies, penetrates the porous structure to a depth of 30-40 µm in localized areas. The combined contamination layers significantly alter the surface's optical properties, reducing its inherent reflectivity to less than 10% across visible wavelengths. The original wood grain is entirely undetectable, its texture and color uniformity lost beneath this stratified, foreign material. The contamination's thickness and adhesion suggest it would compromise any coating adhesion or further conservation efforts.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic surface transformation, fully restoring the mahogany's native anatomical features. The process completely removes the 20 µm contamination layer, revealing well-defined wood cells with intact pit structures and distinct growth rings. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms the elimination of both carbonaceous deposits and biological films, with EDX spectra now showing a 98% reduction in foreign elemental signatures. The underlying wood surface exhibits a measured Ra of 2.1 µm—a 75% decrease in surface roughness that reflects the precise, ablation-based cleaning mechanism.

The restored surface demonstrates excellent structural integrity. Vessel elements and ray parenchyma appear undamaged, with cell walls showing minimal thermal alteration—precisely controlled laser parameters kept subsurface temperatures well below the 380°C thermal destruction point. This selective ablation preserved the delicate middle lamella between fibers, a critical factor for maintaining long-term mechanical strength. The original reddish-brown hue of the mahogany is now uniformly visible, with its characteristic interlocking grain pattern fully restored.

Surface performance metrics show significant improvement. Reflectivity has increased from less than 10% to over 28%, closely matching the material's inherent 32.5% reflectivity specification. The clean, open cell structure allows for optimal moisture vapor transmission, which is crucial for dimensional stability in marine applications. The laser process effectively re-established the original surface morphology without the subsurface crushing or fiber damage typical of mechanical methods, creating an ideal substrate for protective coatings or further conservation treatments.
