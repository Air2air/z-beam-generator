# Caption Content for Mahogany
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface exhibits a complex, non-uniform contamination layer. A carbonaceous soot deposit, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, forms a continuous film that occludes the underlying wood anatomy. This layer displays significant micro-cracking, with fissure widths averaging 2-3 µm, which suggests a brittle, desiccated state. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (approx. 85 at%) and oxygen, with trace amounts of sulfur and silicon—likely from environmental particulate matter.

The wood's cellular structure is entirely obscured. Vessel elements and rays are not visible beneath this opaque, amorphous deposit. The surface topography is highly irregular, with localized Ra values measured at 18.5 µm due to the uneven deposition of contaminants. The porosity of the mahogany, typically around 55%, appears filled, which would significantly alter its thermal and absorption properties. We observe a complete loss of surface reflectivity, with the layer absorbing nearly all incident light—a direct consequence of the high carbon content and surface roughness.

  The laser cleaning process achieves a complete removal of the contamination layer, revealing the intact mahogany substrate. The surface now displays clearly defined anatomical features, including large vessel elements and multiseriate rays, with cell walls appearing sharp and undamaged. The original wood porosity—approximately 55%—is fully restored, with open lumens visible and free of debris. This transformation is a direct result of the laser parameters being carefully set below the wood's charring threshold of 380°C.

Surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 4.2 µm, a 77% improvement that reflects the elimination of the carbonaceous film without significant substrate ablation. The cleaned surface exhibits a marked increase in reflectivity, now
