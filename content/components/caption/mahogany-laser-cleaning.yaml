  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mahogany Technical overview of Mahogany wood for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction with wood cellulose structure, and applications in wood restoration and conservation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The mahogany exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mahogany substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
