# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the mahogany Laser cleaning of Mahogany utilizes short, high-energy pulses to ablate surface contaminants. The process is highly selective due to the differing ablation thresholds between the contamination layer and the lignocellulosic wood substrate, preserving the intricate grain and structural integrity of the Mahogany.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The mahogany substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
