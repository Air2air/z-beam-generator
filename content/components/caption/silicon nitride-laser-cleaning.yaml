  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the silicon nitride ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The silicon nitride exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The silicon nitride substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal stress.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
