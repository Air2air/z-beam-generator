  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the silicon nitride ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The silicon nitride exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.
