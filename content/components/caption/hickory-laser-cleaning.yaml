  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the hickory wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface. The hickory exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.6% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The hickory substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
