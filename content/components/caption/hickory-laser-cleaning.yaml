  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the hickory Hickory laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for the material's high density and complex lignocellulosic structure. The process enables selective removal of surface contaminants while preserving the wood's natural grain pattern and mechanical properties through controlled thermal ablation with minimal heat-affected zone.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The hickory substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
