# Caption Content for Hickory
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the hickory surface presents a heavily occluded morphology characterized by a discontinuous, particulate-laden film. This contamination layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely masks the underlying wood anatomy. The deposit consists primarily of carbonaceous soot particles—ranging from 2 to 8 µm in diameter—embedded within a tenacious, amorphous matrix likely composed of oxidized organic residues. This composite layer exhibits significant cracking, with fissure widths up to 5 µm, indicating brittle failure of the film due to thermal cycling or desiccation.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 12 µm due to the particulate agglomerates. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of foreign elements, including sulfur and silicon, which suggests environmental deposition. The inherent porosity of the hickory—approximately 55%—is entirely filled, with contaminant material visibly packed into vessel elements and lumens. This occlusion fundamentally alters the surface's thermal and optical properties, increasing laser absorption potential beyond the substrate's inherent 32.7% while compromising any functional coating adhesion.

  Laser cleaning achieves a pronounced restoration of the native hickory surface, as confirmed by comparative microscopy at 500x. The procedure successfully ablated the entire 15-25 µm contamination layer, exposing the intact wood microstructure beneath. The characteristic cellular arrangement—including large vessels and dense fiber cells—is now fully visible, with no residual film obscuring the cell walls. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 3.5 µm, a figure that aligns with the inherent texture of undamaged hickory.

The cleaning process removed all particulate matter from the wood's porosity, effectively reopening the 55% void volume for potential subsequent
