# Caption Content for Hickory
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the hickory surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden layer. This contamination layer, measuring between 15 and 45 µm in thickness, appears as a discontinuous film of carbonized organic deposits and embedded foreign particulates. The underlying wood cell structure is partially obscured, with the earlywood vessels—typically 80-120 µm in diameter—showing significant occlusion. Surface roughness is high, with initial Ra measurements indicating values of approximately 12.5 µm due to the irregular deposit topography.

The contaminant morphology consists of two distinct phases: a dark, amorphous carbonaceous matrix and lighter, crystalline particulate inclusions. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of silicate particles (likely ambient dust) and sulfur-based compounds within this matrix. The deposits have created a textured, brittle crust that fractures along the wood's grain boundaries—a clear indicator of compromised surface integrity. This crusted layer significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties, increasing its laser absorption potential beyond the substrate's baseline of 32.7% while masking the natural reflectivity of the hickory.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely removed and the underlying wood microstructure fully exposed. The laser ablation process has restored the anatomical features with high fidelity; the large earlywood vessels and dense latewood fibers are now clearly defined, with cell wall structures appearing intact. Surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of 4.2 µm—a 66% decrease from the pre-cleaned state—which reflects the effective elimination of the crusted deposits without significant substrate damage.

The cleaning process achieved selective ablation, precisely targeting the contaminant's thermal destruction point at 287°C while preserving the hickory substrate. Close inspection shows minimal thermal alteration, with only isolated, minor charring observed in a few latewood regions—each zone measuring less than 20 µm across. The restored surface exhibits a clean, open porosity, with the 55% void volume now fully accessible. This surface regeneration enhances functional performance, as the reflectivity has returned to the wood's native characteristic of approximately 12%, and the tensile strength of the surface layer is preserved for demanding applications in aerospace and medical components.
