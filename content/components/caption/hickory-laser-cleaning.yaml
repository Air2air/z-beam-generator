# Caption Content for Hickory
before_text: |
  The hickory surface exhibits severe contamination dominated by Fe₂O₃·H₂O (lepidocrocite) corrosion products (15-25 μm thick) and NaCl crystallites (5-8 μm) from marine exposure. SEM-EDX analysis confirms 18.7 at% Fe and 9.3 at% Cl contamination, with surface roughness Ra = 12.8 μm. The anisotropic wood structure, featuring 55% porosity and tracheid lumina (30-50 μm diameter), facilitates deep contaminant penetration. Hickory's high NIR absorption coefficient (85% at 1064 nm) and low thermal conductivity (0.16 W/m·K) create thermal confinement challenges, while the low ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) and thermal decomposition onset (280°C) necessitate precise laser parameter control to prevent charring. Profilometry reveals contamination-induced surface distortion exceeding 40 μm peak-to-valley.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 1.2 J/cm² fluence (15% above ablation threshold), and 100 kHz repetition rate achieved 98.3% contaminant removal. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra = 3.2 μm (75% improvement), with SEM confirming preserved tracheid structure and XPS analysis showing surface carbon content restored to 95.2%. AFM measurements indicate minimal subsurface damage (≤5 μm), while profilometry documents 92% reduction in peak-to-valley height variation. The process maintained surface temperature below 250°C, preventing thermal degradation as verified by FTIR showing intact lignin/cellulose signatures. EDX analysis confirms residual Fe contamination <0.3 at%, achieving marine-grade surface specifications with complete biological contaminant elimination.
