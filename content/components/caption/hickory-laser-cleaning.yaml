# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the hickory wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The hickory exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The hickory substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
