  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the cedar wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The cedar exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The cedar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
