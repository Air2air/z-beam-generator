# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the cedar wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The cedar exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The cedar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
