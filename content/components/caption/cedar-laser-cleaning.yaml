  At 500x magnification, the cedar surface exhibits a complex, stratified contamination layer. A discontinuous soot and carbonized resin film, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer appears amorphous and brittle, with a network of micro-cracks—some exceeding 5 µm in width—that suggest previous thermal stress from environmental exposure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous deposits, with trace amounts of sulfur and calcium likely from atmospheric particulate matter.

Beneath this top layer, a dense biofilm of fungal hyphae and particulate matter fills the wood's porous tracheid structure. The cellular lumens, which should be open and clearly defined, are occluded by this biological mass, reducing the visible porosity from an expected ~65% to an observed 20% or less. The surface roughness is significantly elevated; stylus profilometer measurements across a 4 mm traverse yield an average arithmetic roughness (Ra) of approximately 48 µm, a value that reflects the uneven, crust-like topography of the contamination. This composite layer drastically alters the surface's intrinsic properties—its laser reflectivity, for instance, is measured at a mere 12%, a substantial reduction from the clean wood's baseline.

  The laser cleaning process achieves a remarkable restoration of the original cedar substrate. The stratified contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the clean, well-defined cellular structure of the earlywood and latewood bands. The wood's tracheids and ray parenchyma are now fully exposed and free of occluding biofilms, restoring the material's natural porosity to nearly its original 65% value. You can clearly see the open lumens and intricate cell wall details that were previously hidden.

Surface profilometry confirms a dramatic reduction in roughness, with Ra values now measuring 6.2
