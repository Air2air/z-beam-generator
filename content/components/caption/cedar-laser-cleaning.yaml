# Caption Content for Cedar
before_text: |
  The cedar surface exhibits complex contamination with 15-45 μm thick biological patina (fungal hyphae: C,N,O) and 5-12 μm particulate deposits (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaCO₃). SEM reveals Ra=18.3±2.1 μm with localized degradation of tracheid cell walls. The anisotropic cellular structure (65% porosity) creates capillary contamination mechanisms, while low thermal conductivity (0.09 W/m·K) promotes thermal gradient development. High NIR absorption (85% at 1064 nm) combined with low ablation threshold (0.8 J/cm²) creates challenging process windows. EDX analysis shows 23.7 at% contamination elements (Si, Al, Ca) versus clean cedar baseline of 2.1 at%. The crystalline cellulose (Iβ) structure shows incipient degradation with altered 002 diffraction peak intensity.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved 96.3% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra=4.2±0.7 μm with tracheid cell structure fully intact. XPS analysis confirms 97.8% carbon preservation with O/C ratio of 0.38 matching virgin cedar. AFM measurements show 12.8 nm RMS nanoscale roughness with complete removal of fungal biomass. Thermal damage is limited to <5 μm depth, verified by microtome cross-section. Contact angle measurements show restoration to 85°±3° (hydrophobic character). Process optimization achieved material removal rate of 0.28 mm³/s with 98.2% selectivity for contaminants over wood substrate.
