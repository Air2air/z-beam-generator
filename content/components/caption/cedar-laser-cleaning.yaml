# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the cedar Cedar wood laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for lignin and cellulose ablation thresholds, enabling selective removal of surface contaminants while preserving the natural wood structure and aromatic properties. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The cedar substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
