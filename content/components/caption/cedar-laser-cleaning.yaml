  At 500x magnification, the cedar surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile. A continuous, amorphous biofilm—measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer appears as a dark, particulate-laden matrix, likely a composite of fungal hyphae, atmospheric soot, and degraded organic matter. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms elevated levels of sulfur and carbon, pointing to sulfate deposits and carbonaceous particulate entrapment within the wood's porous structure.

The wood's cellular features are largely hidden. The earlywood tracheids, which should display open lumens, are occluded by this infiltrated grime. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 35 µm due to the uneven deposition and the swelling of degraded surface fibers. This contamination layer significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties, increasing laser absorption locally while masking the wood's natural reflectivity. The boundary between the contaminant and the cedar substrate is diffuse, indicating deep penetration into the 65% porosity structure, a condition that complicates superficial cleaning methods.

  Post-cleaning analysis reveals a pronounced transformation. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, exposing the pristine wood substrate. The surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 8.2 µm, a 76% reduction that reflects the restoration of the natural grain texture. Individual tracheid cells are now fully visible, with their distinct lumens and pitted walls clearly defined under 500x magnification.

The laser process achieved selective removal with minimal thermal alteration. SEM inspection shows the ablation threshold was precisely met, vaporizing the contamination while the underlying cedar—with its 380°C thermal destruction point—remained structurally sound. Some slight micro-charring is present on latewood bands, a typical result of their higher density and resin content. Crucially, the process restored the wood's original optical characteristics; its natural reflectivity has returned, and the cleaned surface exhibits no measurable loss of structural integrity in the superficial cell layers.
