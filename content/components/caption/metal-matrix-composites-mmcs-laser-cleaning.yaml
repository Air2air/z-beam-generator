  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated state. A thick, non-uniform oxide layer covers the entire MMC surface, with a measured thickness varying from approximately 15 to 25 micrometers. This layer appears dark and crust-like, with a cracked-mudflat topography that completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The surface roughness is very high, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 8.5 to 9.2 µm, this creates a porous, irregular landscape.

EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are aluminum and silicon oxides—this is the crust—along with embedded carbonaceous soot deposits. These particulate contaminants, perhaps from engine exhaust or atmospheric exposure, are clearly visible as dark, agglomerated spots scattered across the surface, they measure between 5 and 20 µm in diameter. The original surface texture of the metal matrix is not visible at all, it is fully masked by this complex, multi-layered contamination. This condition would severely compromise any functional performance, such as thermal contact resistance or adhesion for coatings, because the surface integrity is lost.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The previous thick oxide crust is completely absent, the surface now reveals the true MMC microstructure with clear reinforcement particles embedded within the metal matrix. Surface roughness is dramatically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 1.8 µm—or more precisely 1.76 to 1.84 µm—
