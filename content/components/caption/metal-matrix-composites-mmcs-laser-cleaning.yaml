# Caption Content for Metal Matrix Composites MMCs
before_text: |
  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated MMC surface. A thick, amorphous oxide layer—approximately 12 to 15 micrometers—completely obscures the underlying composite structure. This dark, tenacious film exhibits extensive micro-cracking and shows clear signs of localized spallation, which indicates poor adhesion and significant internal stress.

The contamination layer itself is not uniform; it displays a complex topography with embedded particulate matter, likely from service exposure. Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual heterogeneity, with Ra values increasing dramatically to 4.8–5.2 µm. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis identifies high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, this confirms the presence of both oxide scale and carbonaceous deposits that have fused to the surface. The original SiC reinforcement particles are not visible, they are fully encapsulated by this contaminated over-layer, which severely compromises the surface's functional properties and its reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning produces a very-very good transformation, the surface now appears completely different. The contaminated over-layer is entirely removed, this process reveals the distinct two-phase microstructure of the aluminum matrix and the silicon carbide reinforcements. The SiC particles—typically 20 to 45 µm in size—are now clearly visible and show clean, sharp interfaces with the metal matrix, a sign of minimal thermal damage.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced, post-cleaning Ra measurements are now 1.5 to 1.8 µm. This is close to the original substrate specification. The laser process leaves a characteristic micro-textured pattern, a fine rippled morphology with a periodicity of approximately 8–10 µm that enhances surface area. No evidence of melting or ablation pits is observed on the aluminum phase, this indicates precise energy control. The surface reflectivity is restored, and the substrate integrity is fully maintained for subsequent operations.
