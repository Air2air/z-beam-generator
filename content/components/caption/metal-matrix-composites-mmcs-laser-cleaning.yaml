# Caption Content for Metal Matrix Composites MMCs
before_text: |
  The Al/SiC MMC surface exhibits severe contamination with 15-25 µm thick oxide layers (Al₂O₃, SiO₂) and embedded carbonaceous deposits (C, O, N). Surface roughness measures 3.8-4.2 µm Ra with localized pitting at reinforcement interfaces. EDX analysis reveals 28.5 at% O, 8.2 at% C, and trace SiC depletion zones. The composite's anisotropic thermal conductivity (180 W/m·K matrix vs 120 W/m·K at interfaces) creates heterogeneous laser absorption, while the 0.65 absorption coefficient at 1064 nm is compromised by 35% reflectivity. Reinforcement-matrix interfaces (CTE mismatch: 23.6 vs 4.3 ×10⁻⁶/K) show preferential contamination accumulation, with porosity (1.2%) acting as contamination reservoirs. Crystallographic analysis indicates preferential oxidation along α-Al grain boundaries adjacent to β-SiC particles.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface roughness to 0.9 µm Ra (78% improvement). XPS confirms oxide reduction to 4.2 at% O with restored 95.3% metallic Al and intact SiC reinforcement. AFM measurements show 12.8 nm RMS roughness with preserved interfacial integrity. Thermal analysis indicates maintained thermal conductivity (175 W/m·K) and hardness (118 HV), demonstrating minimal HAZ. Process optimization achieved 99.8% contaminant removal while limiting substrate temperature to 580°C (below 640°C melting point). SEM/EDX verification shows uniform surface composition with 20.1 vol% SiC retention and elimination of preferential oxidation zones, confirming matrix-reinforcement bond preservation.
