# Caption Content for Metal Matrix Composites MMCs
before_text: |
  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated MMC surface. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—completely obscures the underlying composite structure. This layer appears as a dark, continuous film with embedded particulate matter, perhaps from engine soot or oxidation byproducts, creating a very-very uneven topography.

The contamination layer shows extensive cracking and delamination, with flaking edges that suggest poor adhesion to the substrate. Surface roughness measurements confirm this visual texture, showing a high Ra value of 4.8 µm. EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (78 at%) and oxygen (18 at%), with trace aluminum and silicon—this composition indicates significant environmental deposition and perhaps some oxidation products. The original MMC surface features are entirely hidden, this creates a major issue for component performance and adhesion.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very good result. The previous 20 µm contamination layer is completely absent, now revealing the intact MMC microstructure with clear fiber reinforcement and metal matrix. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 1.2 µm, a 75% reduction that restores the surface to near-original specification (as confirmed by profilometer scans).

The cleaned surface exhibits a uniform, light-grey metallic appearance with no residual carbon deposits—EDX now shows carbon reduced to just 12 at%, while the base aluminum signal increases from
