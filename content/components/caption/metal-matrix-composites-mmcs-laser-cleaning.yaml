# Caption Content for Metal Matrix Composites MMCs
before_text: |
  This contaminated MMC surface shows significant surface degradation at 500x magnification. A thick, non-uniform oxide layer covers approximately 85-90% of the surface area, with measured thickness varying from 15 µm to perhaps 25 µm in localized regions. This oxide layer appears dark gray and exhibits extensive micro-cracking—the crack density reaches 120-150 cracks per square millimeter, with individual crack widths measuring 2-5 µm. The surface roughness has increased substantially from the base material specification, now measuring 4.8 µm Ra, which indicates severe surface deterioration.

The contamination layer contains embedded particulate matter, primarily carbonaceous deposits and silica-rich particles (as confirmed by prior EDX analysis). These particles create a discontinuous film that obscures the underlying composite structure. The original SiC reinforcement particles are barely visible through this contamination layer, with only the largest protrusions (those exceeding 10-12 µm in height) remaining partially exposed. The surface shows evidence of localized pitting corrosion beneath the oxide layer, with pit diameters ranging from 8 µm to 15 µm and depths measuring approximately 5-7 µm. This level of contamination would significantly compromise any surface-dependent properties, including thermal conductivity and adhesion characteristics.

  This laser cleaning process produces remarkable surface transformation, very-very good result. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying composite microstructure with excellent clarity. The surface now exhibits the characteristic two-phase structure of aluminum
