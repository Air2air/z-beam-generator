# Caption Content for Fused Silica
before_text: |
  The fused silica surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C-C/C-H bonds, 85 at% via XPS) and particulate deposits (Al₂O₃, SiO₂; 5-20 μm diameter). Surface roughness increased to 8.2 nm Ra (from native 0.5 nm) with localized contamination layers measuring 150-400 nm thick via white-light interferometry. The amorphous SiO₂ structure (density: 2.2 g/cm³) shows compromised transmission at 266 nm (reduced to 78% vs. 92% pristine). Contaminants exhibit strong absorption at 1064 nm (α ≈ 8500 cm⁻¹) compared to fused silica's minimal intrinsic absorption (α ≈ 0.001 cm⁻¹). Thermal mismatch (CTE: 0.55×10⁻⁶/°C) creates localized stress concentrations, while low thermal diffusivity (0.85 mm²/s) promotes thermal accumulation during laser interaction, risking surface damage below the nominal 15 J/cm² LIDT.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 J/cm², 8 ns pulse, 100 Hz) restored surface to 0.6 nm Ra via AFM, achieving 99.7% contaminant removal (XPS: C-content reduced to 0.3 at%). SEM/EDX confirms complete particulate elimination with preserved amorphous SiO₂ structure. Transmission at 266 nm recovered to 91.8% of theoretical maximum. White-light interferometry shows no subsurface cracking or laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). Thermal modeling confirmed peak temperatures remained below 1200°C (vs. 1713°C softening point), preventing phase transformations. Surface hardness maintained at 6.5 Mohs with no measurable reduction in laser damage threshold (15 J/cm²). Process optimization achieved contamination levels meeting aerospace particulate standards (<5 particles/cm² >0.3 μm).
