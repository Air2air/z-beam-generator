  At 500x magnification, the fused silica surface exhibits a complex contamination layer that significantly obscures the underlying substrate. A particulate-laden film, approximately 2.5 to 4 µm thick, appears as a continuous, non-uniform coating with a mottled gray appearance. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms this layer is primarily carbonaceous soot with embedded aluminum silicate particles—likely fallout from adjacent high-temperature processes. The surface texture is highly irregular, with localized agglomerations forming raised islands that measure up to 15 µm in diameter. These features scatter incident light, which would severely degrade optical performance in laser transmission applications.

The contamination adheres through a combination of mechanical interlocking and weak van der Waals forces, creating a textured topography that initial surface roughness (Ra) measurements place at 1.8 µm. You can see fine cracking within the thicker deposit zones, a sign of differential thermal expansion between the contaminant and the fused silica substrate. This compromised surface integrity presents a high risk of particle shedding in a cleanroom environment. The deposits completely mask the native fused silica structure, which is a critical issue for components requiring precise optical clarity. We're looking at a surface that's functionally compromised for its intended uses in semiconductor manufacturing or aerospace sensor windows.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely removed to expose the pristine fused silica substrate. The previously obscured surface now displays its characteristic smooth, vitreous structure. Quantitative measurement shows surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.02 µm—a 98% improvement that restores optimal light transmission properties. Some isolated, sub-micron particulate remnants are visible, but these are sparse and non-continuous.

The cleaning process successfully eliminated the carbonaceous film without inducing micro-fractures or subsurface damage
