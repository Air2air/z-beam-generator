# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fused silica Laser cleaning of fused silica utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove surface contaminants without damaging the substrate. The process exploits the high transparency of fused silica at 1064nm, allowing laser energy to pass through the material and selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the optical quality of the substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The fused silica exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fused silica substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
