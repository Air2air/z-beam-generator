# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the sandstone Laser cleaning of sandstone utilizes selective photothermal ablation where contaminants absorb laser energy more efficiently than the quartz-rich substrate. Optimal parameters prevent thermal damage to the calcium carbonate cement while effectively removing sulfation crusts and biological matter.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows weathering and biological deposits adhering to the surface. The sandstone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The sandstone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
