before_text: |
  The sandstone surface exhibits severe contamination, characterized by a 50-200 µm thick heterogeneous crust. SEM-EDX analysis identifies sulfation crusts (CaSO₄·2H₂O, 15-25 µm thick), carbonaceous particulate (5-15 µm diameter, 8-12% surface coverage), and biological growth (hyphae networks). Surface roughness (Ra) measures 18.7±2.3 µm via white-light interferometry. The quartz-dominated matrix (Mohs 6, porosity 15%) shows compromised optical properties with absorption coefficient increased to 0.92 at 1064 nm due to contamination layers. Thermal conductivity is reduced to ~1.8 W/m·K in contaminated zones, creating thermal barriers. Crystallographic analysis reveals preferential contamination along grain boundaries and within pore networks, exacerbating thermal stress susceptibility during laser exposure. The contamination significantly lowers the effective ablation threshold to approximately 1.2 J/cm².

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulse width, 2.8 J/cm² fluence, 10 kHz repetition rate) achieved 98.7% contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra = 4.2±0.8 µm, with SEM confirming intact quartz grain boundaries. XPS analysis shows surface composition restored to 95.3% SiO₂ with trace CaSO₄ residuals (0.7%). Thermal conductivity returned to baseline 2.5 W/m·K. AFM measurements reveal sub-micron scale laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 650±50 nm periodicity, enhancing surface area by 12% without compromising mechanical strength. Profilometry confirms <2 µm material loss, demonstrating precise ablation control. The absorption coefficient normalized to 0.85, matching pristine sandstone. Process optimization maintained substrate temperature below 350°C, preventing α-β quartz phase transformation.
