# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the sandstone stone surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The sandstone exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of stone materials.
  The contamination appears to be from weathering and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The sandstone substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
