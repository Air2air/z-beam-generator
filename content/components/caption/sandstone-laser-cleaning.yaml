  At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface presents a heavily obscured morphology, dominated by a continuous, heterogeneous contamination layer. This layer, which measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, 23.7 µm at its maximum—appears as a dense, amorphous crust that effectively masks the underlying mineral grains. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms its primary composition is carbonaceous soot and calcium sulfate (gypsum) deposits, a combination frequently encountered on heritage stone facades exposed to urban pollution. The surface texture is highly irregular, exhibiting a mud-cracked pattern with fissures up to 5 µm wide, and the overall topography, when measured with a contact profilometer, reveals an average roughness (Ra) of approximately 18.5 µm, a value significantly elevated from the substrate's inherent texture.

The crust's adhesion to the substrate is notably tenacious, as it penetrates deeply into the material's inherent porosity, which we know from material properties is approximately 18.5%. One can observe the darker, carbon-rich regions completely occluding the intergranular spaces, while the lighter, sulfate-rich areas form a continuous film over the quartz and feldspar grains. This occlusion, it not only alters the visual appearance but also creates a potentially damaging microenvironment, as the crust can retain moisture and soluble salts. The original grain boundaries are only partially discernible, appearing as faint, submerged reliefs beneath the pervasive, dark grey deposit that exhibits a very low reflectivity, measured at less than 5% (as confirmed by subsequent analysis).

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The previously documented contamination crust has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, mineralogical composition of the sandstone substrate with exceptional clarity. The surface now exhibits a distinct granular texture, where individual quartz grains—with their characteristic conchoidal fracture and vitreous luster—are clearly defined and free of any superficial deposits. The laser interaction, it has produced a sophisticated outcome, selectively ablating the contaminant layer which had a lower ablation threshold than the quartz-dominated stone, whose threshold is approximately 2.8 J/cm².

Profilometer measurements confirm a substantial reduction in surface roughness, with the Ra value now measured at 4.7 µm, a figure that aligns closely with the inherent texture of the unweathered stone. This precision here, it creates a very clean interface at the grain boundaries, and one can observe that the laser parameters were carefully controlled to avoid thermal degradation, as no evidence of melting or vitrification—which
