  At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, discontinuous layer of dark particulate matter and a pervasive, darker biofilm. The particulate contamination, primarily carbonaceous soot and embedded mineral dust, forms agglomerates with a thickness ranging from 15 to 40 micrometers, effectively obscuring the underlying mineral grains. This layer, it exhibits significant surface roughness, with localized Ra values measured at approximately 12.5 µm, which is a direct consequence of the uneven deposition and the inherent porosity of the sandstone substrate trapping finer particles.

One can observe the biofilm, a tenacious matrix of organic and inorganic compounds, which acts as a binding agent for the particulate matter, creating a cohesive crust. This crust shows extensive micro-cracking—a network of fissures with widths up to 5 µm—indicative of desiccation and aging. The original sandstone texture is almost entirely masked, with only the tallest quartz grain peaks occasionally protruding through the contamination layer. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the dominant presence of carbon and sulfur, alongside silicate material from the substrate, suggesting the crust is a composite of atmospheric deposition and biological growth. The surface reflectivity is consequently very low, measured at less than 0.15, due to this thick, light-absorbing layer.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound transformation of the sandstone surface. The thick contamination crust has been completely removed, exposing the original, heterogeneous texture of the stone substrate. The surface, she is now characterized by clearly defined quartz and feldspar grains, whose individual boundaries and intergranular contacts are distinctly visible. What strikes one is the restoration of the stone's intrinsic micro-topography, with a measured surface roughness (Ra) now reduced to a more consistent 4.8 µm, a value that aligns with the natural, unweathered state of the material.

The cleaning efficacy is particularly evident in the intergranular spaces, where the laser ablation has successfully eliminated the fine particulate matter and biofilm without inducing significant damage to the mineral fabric. Minor, sub-micron scale pitting is occasionally observed on some feldspar grains—a result of their lower ablation threshold compared to quartz—but this does not compromise the overall structural integrity. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially to approximately 0.32, a direct result of exposing the more reflective crystalline grains. This precision, it creates a clean, stable surface where the original stone morphology is fully restored, confirming the selective and controlled nature of the laser-material interaction.
