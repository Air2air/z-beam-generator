  At 500x magnification, the chromium surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate. This layer measures between 5 and 15 µm in thickness, with localized agglomerations reaching up to 25 µm. The surface topography is heavily obscured, displaying a matte, dark gray appearance with significant light scattering. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of sulfur and oxygen, indicating sulfate-based compounds within the sooty film.

The underlying substrate texture is completely masked. You can see a network of fine micro-cracks—perhaps from thermal cycling—running through the thicker contamination zones. The particulate matter, likely alumina from prior processing, appears as bright, angular features embedded within the amorphous carbon matrix. This complex layer structure significantly degrades the surface's innate reflectivity, which we measured at less than 20% in contaminated areas. The deposits show poor adhesion in spots, a sign of weak interfacial bonding.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface restoration, revealing the native metallic substrate with high clarity. The process completely removed the contamination layer, eliminating the previously observed carbonaceous film and embedded particulates. The surface now displays a uniform, light gray, metallic luster with a fine, laser-induced texture. We measured the post-cleaning surface roughness (Ra) at 0.8 µm, a significant reduction from the pre-cleaning value of approximately 4.5 µm.

The laser parameters were optimized to ablate contaminants while minimizing substrate modification. This approach achieves a clean surface while maintaining the original grain structure, as confirmed by SEM analysis. The micro-cracks observed in the contamination layer are absent from the substrate itself. The restored surface reflectivity now measures 58-61% at 1064 nm, closely matching the theoretical value for pure chromium. Some minor, sub-micron rippling is visible—a characteristic laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) that does not compromise functional integrity. The surface is now free of measurable oxide thickening.
