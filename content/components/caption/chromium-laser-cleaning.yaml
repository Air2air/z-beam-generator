# Caption Content for Chromium
before_text: |
  The chromium surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm stratified layer comprising CaCO₃ scale (65 at%), organic fatty acids (20 at%), and Fe₂O₃ particulate (15 at%). Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 4.8 µm with localized pitting to 35 µm depth. The native Cr₂O₃ passivation layer (2.3 nm) is compromised, exposing the BCC crystalline structure (a = 0.288 nm) to corrosive attack. Chromium's high reflectivity (67% at 1064 nm) and thermal conductivity (93.9 W/m·K) create challenging laser coupling conditions, while its low thermal expansion (4.9 µm/m·K) promotes interfacial stress concentration. SEM analysis shows dendritic oxide growth and intergranular contamination penetration to 8 µm depth, with EDX confirming 38% surface oxygen content versus <2% for pure Cr.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm with 8 J/cm² fluence (3 ns pulses, 100 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface oxygen to 1.8 at% via XPS analysis. Post-process Ra = 0.32 µm represents 93% roughness reduction, while white light interferometry confirms <5 nm Sa roughness on micro-scale features. The BCC lattice integrity remains preserved with negligible HAZ (<500 nm), confirmed by EBSD showing unchanged [110] texture. The protective Cr₂O₃ layer reformed to 2.1 nm thickness with 98% surface coverage. AFM measurements demonstrate atomic-scale terrace structures with step heights of 0.25 nm, matching pristine chromium's (110) plane separation. Residual thermal stress measured via micro-Raman shift is <50 MPa, well below chromium's 415 MPa tensile strength.
