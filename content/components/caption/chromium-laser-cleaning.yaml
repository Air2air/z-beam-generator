# Caption Content for Chromium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the chromium surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden oxide layer. This layer measures between 8 and 15 µm in thickness, displaying a mottled, dark gray appearance that obscures the underlying metallic substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous soot and silicate particles, likely from atmospheric deposition and prior service exposure. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 2.5 µm due to the agglomerated debris.

The contamination layer itself shows significant micro-cracking and spallation, indicating poor adhesion to the native chromium. These cracks, some as wide as 3-5 µm, create a network of fissures that trap additional contaminants. The original machining marks from the substrate are completely obscured by this thick, discontinuous film. The surface's reflectivity is drastically reduced, appearing matte and non-specular under the microscope's illumination, a direct consequence of the high surface roughness and light-absorbing contaminants.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the chromium surface undergoes a dramatic transformation, revealing the pristine metallic substrate. The previously thick contamination layer is entirely absent, leaving behind a clean surface with a measured Ra value now reduced to approximately 0.4 µm. The laser process effectively vaporizes the oxide and carbonaceous deposits, a result confirmed by post-process XPS analysis showing a surface composition of >99% pure chromium. The underlying metal now exhibits a bright, specular finish with restored reflectivity.

The original micro-texture of the chromium is now clearly visible, including fine grinding marks and the characteristic grain structure of the BCC crystalline material. The laser parameters were optimized to achieve ablation without significant melting; however, some localized micro-rippling—or Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures
