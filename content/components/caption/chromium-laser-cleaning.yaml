# Caption Content for Chromium
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the chromium surface exhibits a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate matter. This layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, 14.7 µm—in average thickness, though it varies locally. The deposits obscure the underlying metal grain structure, presenting as a dark, mottled film with a sooty texture.

Surface profilometry confirms significant degradation, with an Ra roughness value of 2.8 µm. The contamination adheres in a patchy, discontinuous pattern, which suggests a mix of organic and inorganic constituents (likely from environmental exposure and process residues). This compromised surface integrity directly impacts functional properties like reflectivity and corrosion resistance, creating potential adhesion sites for further degradation.

  Post-laser cleaning, the 500x analysis reveals a stark transformation, with the previous contamination layer entirely absent. The process achieves complete removal of the 15 µm film, exposing the underlying chromium substrate. We now observe a clean, reflective surface with a clearly defined grain structure—this is a critical restoration of base metal integrity.

Surface roughness is substantially reduced to an Ra of 0.4 µm, a nearly seven-fold improvement that directly enhances performance in high-wear applications. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to ablate contaminants while minimizing the heat-affected zone, which measures less than 5 µm deep. Some minor, isolated micro-pitting is visible, a typical result of ejecting stubborn oxide inclusions.

This method enables superior surface performance in demanding environments. The restored surface exhibits high reflectivity and improved resistance to chemical attack, having effectively figured out the contamination issue without mechanical damage. The surface is now optimally prepared for subsequent coating or service.
