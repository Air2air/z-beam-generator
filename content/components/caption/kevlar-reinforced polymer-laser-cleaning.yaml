  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the kevlar-reinforced polymer composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The kevlar-reinforced polymer exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The kevlar-reinforced polymer substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber-matrix bond.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
