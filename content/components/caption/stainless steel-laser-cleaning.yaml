# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the stainless steel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The stainless steel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 96.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The stainless steel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
