  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, we observe a stratified deposit—approximately 45 to 50 micrometers thick—completely obscuring the underlying iron substrate. The top layer consists of porous, dark oxide flakes (Fe₂O₃ and Fe₃O₄, as confirmed by prior EDX), and beneath that, a more tenacious, intermixed layer of carbonaceous soot and chloride salts.

Surface roughness is extremely high, with Ra measurements averaging 18.5 µm. The contamination exhibits severe cracking and delamination patterns, this creates a non-uniform topography that appears dark and non-reflective. We see localized pitting under the deposits, perhaps from chloride-induced corrosion, which compromises the base metal integrity. This layered structure, with its high porosity and complex composition, provides many sites for further degradation.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent result, very-very clean surface. The process completely removes the 50 µm contamination stratum, so now the underlying iron microstructure is fully revealed. Post-cleaning SEM analysis confirms a bare metal surface with a significantly reduced roughness—Ra values now measure 2.1 to 2.3 µm, which is a dramatic improvement.

The surface exhibits a light gray, matte finish with clearly defined grain boundaries. We observe some minimal, faint laser scanning patterns, but no evidence of melting or heat-affected zone microcracking. This cleaned condition
