# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the iron metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The iron exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The iron substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
