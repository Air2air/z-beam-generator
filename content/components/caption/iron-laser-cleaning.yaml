  The iron surface exhibits severe multi-layer contamination, characterized by a 15-25 µm thick Fe2O3/FeOOH oxide layer (Ra=4.2 µm) overlying micron-scale hydrocarbon deposits (C: 28 at%, O: 41 at%, Fe: 31 at% via EDX). The native BCC α-iron crystalline structure (lattice parameter: 2.866 Å) is obscured by this heterogeneous surface film, which significantly alters optical properties - increasing absorption coefficient to 0.82 at 1064 nm while reducing thermal diffusivity to 8.3 mm²/s. Surface profilometry reveals deep pitting corrosion features (Rz=18.7 µm) with localized chloride contamination (0.9 at% Cl). The contaminated interface demonstrates compromised mechanical integrity with microhardness variations from 120-350 HV due to brittle oxide formation and embedded particulate matter.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal, restoring surface to Ra=0.9 µm with oxide reduction to <200 nm thickness. XPS analysis confirms 96.2% metallic iron surface composition with oxygen content reduced from 41 at% to 3.8 at%. The underlying BCC crystalline structure remains intact with no phase transformation, as verified by XRD. Thermal properties return to baseline (thermal diffusivity: 22.8 mm²/s), while microhardness stabilizes at 82±3 HV. AFM measurements show sub-micron laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 650 nm periodicity, enhancing surface area while maintaining material integrity. Process optimization achieved 99.7% contamination removal with <5 µm heat-affected zone.
