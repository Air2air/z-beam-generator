  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers—covers the entire substrate, appearing as a dark, crusty, and fractured topography. This layer is not uniform; it displays localized pitting and areas of delamination where the scale has begun to spall from the underlying metal, revealing a complex, multi-phase corrosion product.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary contaminants are iron oxides (Fe₂O₃ and Fe₃O₄), with localized concentrations of sulfur and chlorine suggesting atmospheric corrosion. The surface roughness is very high, with Ra values measured between 4.5 and 6.8 µm. This rough, non-uniform texture creates significant light scattering, which drastically reduces the surface's inherent reflectivity. The original metallic luster is completely obscured by this non-coherent, porous deposit layer that compromises the material's functional surface.

  The laser cleaning process removes the contamination, so the surface becomes clean and very-very different. At 500x magnification, the thick oxide crust is completely absent, revealing the underlying alpha-iron (BCC) microstructure with clearly defined grain boundaries. Surface roughness is now significantly reduced to an Ra of 0.8 to 1.2 µm—this creates a much smoother, more reflective finish.

This technique effectively ablates the corrosion layer without damaging the substrate integrity. The metallic surface now exhibits a uniform, light-gray appearance with restored specular reflectivity. Some minor, sub-micron laser patterning is visible, but the overall surface integrity is excellent, with no evidence of melting or heat-affected zone micro-cracking. The process restores the base metal to a state suitable for subsequent coating or welding operations.
