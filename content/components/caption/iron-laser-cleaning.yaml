# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the iron metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The iron exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The iron substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with negligible substrate modification.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while maintaining material properties.
