  This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated iron substrate. A non-uniform oxide layer, approximately 15 to 20 µm thick, dominates the surface topography. This layer exhibits a characteristic reddish-brown coloration with localized black Fe₃O₄ nodules, and its morphology is highly porous and fractured.

Surface roughness measurements confirm significant degradation, with an Ra value of 4.8 µm. The contamination layer shows clear delamination at several interfaces, which creates micro-cracks that propagate into the base metal. EDX analysis identifies the primary contaminants as oxygen and carbon, with trace chlorine and sulfur elements—this indicates atmospheric corrosion and perhaps industrial deposit accumulation. The surface integrity is very-very compromised, so the reflectivity is low and the potential for further degradation is high.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very clear at 500x magnification. The previous 20 µm contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the underlying α-Fe grain structure. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallic grey appearance with clearly defined grain boundaries.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 1.2 µm—or more precisely 1.15 µm—which represents a 75% improvement. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly elemental iron, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of about 0.1 µm remaining. This passive layer is good-good for long-term stability.
