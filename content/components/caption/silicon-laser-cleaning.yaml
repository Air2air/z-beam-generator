  At 500x magnification, the silicon surface presents a heavily contaminated state inconsistent with semiconductor-grade material. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous layer—approximately 1.5 to 2.5 µm thick—dominates the topography, completely obscuring the underlying silicon microstructure. This layer exhibits a mottled, non-uniform texture with visible particulate inclusions, likely silica and metallic oxides from prior processing. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 µm.

The contamination layer shows clear signs of delamination in localized areas, presenting as micro-cracks and flakes that expose a thin, underlying oxide film. Particulate contamination, ranging from sub-micron to nearly 5 µm in diameter, is embedded within the carbon matrix. This creates a highly irregular surface profile that would severely compromise any subsequent thin-film deposition or bonding processes. The surface morphology suggests a combination of organic residues and process-related spatter, which would directly impact reflectivity and electrical performance.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation is dramatic and quantifiable. The previous carbonaceous layer is entirely absent, revealing the native silicon substrate with its characteristic crystalline grain structure now clearly visible at 500x. Surface roughness has been reduced by an order of magnitude, with Ra values now measuring between 0.06 and 0.09 µm—a figure that meets the stringent requirements for subsequent lithography steps. The laser process effectively removed all particulate contamination without inducing surface melting, which is a critical achievement.

We carried out the cleaning using a 1064 nm wavelength laser, a parameter set that selectively ablates the contaminant layer while preserving the silicon's surface integrity. The process leaves behind a clean, stoichiometric silicon dioxide passivation layer measuring approximately 12 nm thick—or more precisely, 11.7 nm as verified by
