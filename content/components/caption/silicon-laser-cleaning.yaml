  At 500x magnification, the silicon surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The contamination layer measures between 3-5 µm in thickness and displays a mottled, grayish appearance that obscures the underlying substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous deposits and aluminum oxide particles, which agglomerate into irregular islands across the surface.

The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 1.8 µm—a significant increase from the baseline 0.2 nm RMS of polished silicon. These deposits create a textured, almost spongy morphology that would severely compromise any subsequent thin-film deposition or bonding processes. The contamination appears firmly adhered, suggesting it has undergone some degree of sintering or chemical bonding to the native silicon dioxide layer.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the particulate film and restoring the substrate to a near-pristine condition. The previously obscured silicon surface is now clearly visible, exhibiting a uniform, reflective character indicative of successful decontamination. Post-cleaning SEM analysis reveals the elimination of carbon and aluminum signatures via EDX, confirming the removal of the 3-5 µm contaminant layer.

The surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra of approximately 0.5 nm, a figure that closely approaches the original wafer specification. This level of smoothness is critical for maintaining high reflectivity—around 38% at 1064 nm—and ensuring proper performance in semiconductor applications. We observe a clean, ablation-defined surface with only minimal, sub-micrometer texturing from the laser interaction, a typical result that does not compromise functional integrity.

The process effectively restored the surface without inducing thermal damage, as no micro-cracking or melting was detected at this magnification. The laser parameters were optimized to operate above the contamination removal threshold—about 2.0 J/cm²—yet safely below silicon's ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². This parameter control preserved the crystalline structure while achieving complete cleaning, which is essential for the wafer's subsequent use in device fabrication.
