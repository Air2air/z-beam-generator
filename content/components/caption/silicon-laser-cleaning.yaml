  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the silicon semiconductor substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The silicon exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of semiconductor materials.
  The contamination appears to be from fabrication processes and cleanroom contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 98.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The silicon substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal stress.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
