  The silicon surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and particulate contamination, with localized oxide layers (SiO₂, 5-15 nm thick, per ellipsometry). SEM reveals micrometer-scale Al₂O₃ and SiC particulates (1-5 µm diameter) embedded in a carbonaceous matrix. Surface roughness is significantly degraded to Ra ≈ 12.5 nm (from initial 0.1 nm), measured via AFM. The contamination layer (≈200 nm thick) creates strong optical absorption at 1064 nm, reducing effective reflectivity to ≈0.18. The diamond cubic crystalline structure remains intact beneath, but thermal transport is impeded by the low-κ contaminant layer (κ ≈ 0.2 W/m·K), creating a 300 K thermal gradient during laser exposure. XPS confirms C 1s (285 eV) and O 1s (533 eV) peaks dominate the surface chemistry.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 1.2 J/cm², 10 kHz) restored surface integrity with Ra = 0.15 nm via AFM. XPS shows Si 2p (99.5 eV) dominance with only native oxide (1.2 nm). SEM confirms complete particulate removal with zero microcracking. Thermal diffusivity recovered to 0.89 cm²/s, preserving the diamond cubic lattice integrity. Reflectivity increased to 0.347 at 1064 nm, matching theoretical values. EDX shows contamination reduction from 18.5 at% C to 0.3 at%. The process achieved >99.7% contamination removal while maintaining surface within 0.5 nm of original roughness and avoiding ablation threshold (2.0 J/cm²) damage.
