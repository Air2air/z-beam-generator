  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the stoneware ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The stoneware exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The stoneware substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal loading.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
