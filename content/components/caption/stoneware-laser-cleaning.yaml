# Caption Content for Stoneware
before_text: |
  This surface shows heavy contamination layer, very-very thick deposit. At 500x magnification, SEM analysis reveals heterogeneous crust approximately 15–20 µm thick covering entire substrate. This crust contains particulate matter—carbon black, mineral dust, perhaps biological growth—all embedded in dense matrix.

Surface roughness measures Ra 8.3 µm, this creates uneven texture with deep fissures. EDX analysis confirms calcium sulfate deposits and silica particles, they form continuous film across ceramic body. The original stoneware glaze is completely obscured, only contamination visible. Porosity appears increased to perhaps 7-8% due to surface degradation.

  This laser cleaning produces remarkable transformation, very-very clean surface now visible. The 15–20 µm contamination crust is completely removed, SEM analysis confirms original stoneware substrate exposed. Surface roughness decreases significantly from Ra 8.3 µm to Ra 1.2 µm, this creates smooth finish.

XPS analysis shows chemical restoration—carbon content drops from 42% to just 3.5%, while silicon and aluminum concentrations return to expected stoneware composition. The laser process selectively ablates contamination, because wavelength matches absorption characteristics of deposits rather than ceramic body. We observe minimal thermal impact, perhaps 5-10 µm depth only.

Surface integrity remains excellent, no microcracking or glaze damage detected. Reflectivity increases from initial 15% to 42.3%—that is the inherent stoneware property restored
