  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the stoneware ceramic surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The stoneware exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from firing processes and handling contamination.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The stoneware substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal stress.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
