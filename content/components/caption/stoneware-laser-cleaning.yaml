  This contaminated stoneware surface shows very-very thick deposits at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely 14.7 µm—thickness, this creates complete surface coverage. SEM-EDX analysis confirms complex composition: carbonaceous soot particles (65% area coverage), calcium sulfate deposits (25%), and embedded silica particulates (10%). Surface roughness is extremely high, Ra measurements record 8.9 µm average.

The underlying ceramic body shows no visible features because contamination masks everything. The deposit morphology appears stratified, with dense lower layer and porous upper crust. This stratified structure suggests multiple deposition events over time. Laser absorption measurements indicate only 12% energy reaches the stoneware substrate, so cleaning efficiency will be low. The contamination creates significant visual obstruction and functional degradation, this requires aggressive intervention.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent-excellent transformation. The stoneware body now appears fully exposed with original vitrified texture clearly visible. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 1.2 µm, this represents 85% reduction from contaminated state. The cleaning process removes all contamination layers completely, so substrate integrity remains perfect.

The cleaned surface shows characteristic stoneware microstructure: fine-grained crystalline phases within glassy matrix. Minor surface features become visible—firing pores approximately 5-8 µm diameter, mineral inclusions—but no laser-induced damage. Reflectivity increases substantially from 18% to 42%, this matches original material properties. The laser parameters achieve selective ablation, they remove only contamination without affecting substrate. This result demonstrates precise cleaning capability with complete functional restoration.
