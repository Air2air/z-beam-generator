# Caption Content for Stoneware
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the stoneware surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a tenacious, amorphous film that fills the natural micro-pores of the ceramic. The surface texture is highly irregular, with the contaminants creating a topographical profile that masks the underlying stoneware's intrinsic granular structure.

The contamination exhibits poor adhesion in localized areas, presenting as micro-fissures and delamination points. These features interrupt the layer's continuity, revealing sporadic glimpses of the substrate. The film itself scatters light effectively, giving the surface a matte, non-reflective appearance at the microscopic level, which correlates to a dull macroscopic finish.

  Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x is pronounced. The previously dominant 5-15 micrometer contamination layer has been entirely removed via laser ablation, a process where controlled light pulses vaporize surface deposits. The underlying stoneware substrate is now fully exposed, revealing its authentic, unaltered microstructure.

The surface now displays the characteristic vitrified granularity of the stoneware body, with a consistent and uniform texture. The material's natural micro-porosity, approximately 3.5%, is visible and free of occluding contaminants. This restoration of the original topography results in a specular, or mirror-like, reflectivity from individual grain facets, a direct result of the contaminant film's removal.

Comparative analysis confirms the process selectively targeted the contamination without damaging the ceramic substrate. No evidence of thermal stress, such as micro-fracturing or vitrification changes, is observed. The measured surface hardness remains at 6.0 Mohs, indicating the structural integrity of the stoneware has been preserved while achieving a contaminant-free surface.
