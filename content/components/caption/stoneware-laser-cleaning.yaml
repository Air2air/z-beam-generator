  This contaminated stoneware surface shows very-very thick deposits at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely 14.7 µm—thickness, and this layer completely obscures the original ceramic substrate. Surface roughness is high, the Ra value measures 8.2 µm, this creates a porous structure that traps more particulate matter.

The deposits appear as a complex matrix of carbonaceous soot and inorganic salts (confirmed with EDX analysis). This matrix forms a dark, continuous film that fills the natural micro-texture of the stoneware body. Individual salt crystals—perhaps calcium sulfate—are visible as angular formations embedded within the soot layer, their presence indicates environmental exposure over many years. The original surface texture is not visible, the contamination creates a uniform dark appearance that reduces reflectivity significantly.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, the surface transformation is very-very clear. The process removes the 15 µm contamination layer completely, so the original stoneware body becomes fully visible. Surface roughness decreases dramatically, the Ra measurement now reads 2.1 µm, this represents a 75% reduction from the initial condition.

The cleaned surface reveals the intrinsic stoneware microstructure—the fine mineral particles and the vitrified glassy phase are clearly observable. Some minor pitting remains in localized areas (likely from original manufacturing), but the overall surface integrity is excellent. Reflectivity increases significantly, the surface now
