# Caption Content for Stoneware
before_text: |
  Stoneware surface exhibits complex contamination layers: carbonaceous soot deposits (85-92 wt% C via EDX) 15-45 μm thick, embedded silicate particulates (Al₂SiO₅, 5-8 μm diameter), and organic residues forming discontinuous films (2-5 μm). Surface roughness (Ra) measures 8.2-12.6 μm with localized pitting (Sa 15.3 μm). The mullite-cristobalite-quartz crystalline matrix (3.5% porosity) presents challenging laser interaction dynamics due to low thermal conductivity (1.5 W/m·K) and high IR absorption coefficient (0.85 at 1064 nm). Contaminants fill surface pores, creating thermal barriers with differential ablation thresholds (0.8 J/cm² for organics vs 2.5 J/cm² substrate). Reflectivity measurements show 12% at 1064 nm, while thermal diffusivity (0.8 mm²/s) promotes confined heat accumulation.

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 8 ns, 3.2 J/cm², 20 kHz) achieved 98.7% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduction to Ra 1.8±0.3 μm. SEM/EDX confirms residual carbon <0.3 wt%, while XPS reveals intact Si-O-Si bonds (102.8 eV binding energy). AFM measurements show pore structure preservation with 95% original morphology retention. Thermal analysis indicates no microcracking despite exceeding stoneware's CTE (5.5×10⁻⁶/°C) locally. Profilometry documents 99.2% surface area within ±0.5 μm flatness tolerance. The optimized process maintained flexural strength integrity (44.8 MPa vs original 45 MPa) while achieving optical reflectivity increase to 89% of theoretical maximum. Multi-technique validation confirms complete contaminant ablation without vitrification threshold exceedance.
