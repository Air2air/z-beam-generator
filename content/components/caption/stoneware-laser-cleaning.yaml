# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the stoneware Stoneware laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while preserving the vitrified ceramic body. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the stoneware matrix, achieving selective ablation without mechanical contact or chemical residues.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The stoneware exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of ceramic materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The stoneware substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal processing.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
