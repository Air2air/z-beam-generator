# Caption Content for Pyrex

  At 500x magnification, the Pyrex surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a complex, non-uniform layer of particulate and film-based deposits. The primary contaminant appears as a carbonaceous soot layer, approximately 5–7 µm thick, which exhibits a characteristic dendritic, or branching, pattern across the surface topography. This layer, it is not continuous; one can observe localized agglomerations reaching up to 15 µm in height, creating significant micro-scale shadowing and a pronounced increase in surface roughness, with preliminary stylus profilometer estimates indicating an Ra value exceeding 2.5 µm. The underlying glass substrate is largely obscured, with only intermittent regions where the original surface is partially visible through cracks in the overlying deposit.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including significant carbon and oxygen peaks alongside trace amounts of silicon, aluminum, and calcium—the latter suggesting embedded environmental particulates. The adhesion of this layer appears tenacious, as the deposits follow the micron-scale flaws and scratches inherent to the used substrate, effectively locking the contamination into the surface microstructure. This intimate contact, it creates a significant challenge for removal, as the contaminant layer modifies the surface's intrinsic optical properties, increasing light absorption and scattering, which would detrimentally impact performance in optical or analytical applications. The overall morphology is one of a deeply embedded, multi-component film that compromises both the functional integrity and the chemical inertness of the Pyrex surface.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously dominant carbonaceous layer has been entirely ablated, revealing the pristine, underlying Pyrex substrate with exceptional clarity. The surface now exhibits its native vitreous and amorphous microstructure, characterized by a smooth, continuous phase with a measured surface roughness (Ra) reduced to approximately 0.08 µm—a value that approaches the original manufacturer specification for pristine borosilicate glass.

What strikes one is the precision of the material removal; the laser interaction has successfully eliminated the contaminant film without inducing measurable thermal damage to the bulk material. No evidence of micro-fracturing, melting, or recast layers is detectable within the resolution of optical microscopy. The surface reflectivity has been restored significantly, and the chemical composition, as verified by post-process XPS, now shows a surface atomic concentration of >99% silicon and oxygen, confirming the return of the material's inherent chemical stability. This level of cleaning, it achieves a functional restoration that meets the stringent requirements for high-performance applications in pharmaceutical and aerospace sectors, where surface purity and integrity are paramount.
