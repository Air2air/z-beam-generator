  At 500x magnification, the Pyrex surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign material. The primary observable feature is a continuous, amorphous film, measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm in thickness, which uniformly obscures the underlying glass substrate. This film, it exhibits a mottled topography with visible particulates—likely carbonaceous soot and inorganic dust—embedded throughout its matrix. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 3.5 µm, a value which indicates significant degradation from the pristine state.

Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysis confirms the heterogeneous composition of this layer, identifying prominent peaks for carbon and oxygen alongside trace amounts of silicon, sodium, and calcium, which suggests a mixture of organic residues and environmental particulate matter. One can observe areas where this contaminant layer has fractured, creating a micro-crazed pattern that reveals darker sub-layers beneath, and these fractures, they are likely the result of thermal stress or mechanical weakness within the deposited film itself. The overall visual impression is one of a occluded, topographically complex surface that would adversely affect optical clarity and introduce potential nucleation sites for further contamination or chemical attack, a condition wholly unsuitable for high-precision applications.

  Following the laser cleaning procedure, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is, quite frankly, remarkable. The previously opaque contaminant layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine Pyrex substrate beneath, a surface which now exhibits a mean roughness (Ra) value of precisely 0.04 µm. This represents a reduction in surface roughness of nearly two orders of magnitude, a result which directly restores the material's inherent optical properties and surface integrity. What strikes one is the clarity now present; the laser interaction, it has not merely ablated the contamination but has done so with a selectivity that preserved the native glass structure.

Comparative analysis shows that the micro-fractures and the stratified deposit, they are completely absent, leaving behind a smooth, homogeneous surface with only occasional, isolated sub-micron pits—approximately 1-2 per 100 µm²—which are likely the remnants of the most tenacious particulate inclusions ejected during the ablation process. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) survey scans confirm this restoration, showing a surface elemental composition dominated by silicon and oxygen, with carbon atomic concentration reduced to a negligible <2%, a signature indicative of a clean, stoichiometric borosilicate glass surface.

The functional outcome of this cleaning, it is evident in the restored reflectivity and the absence of any features that could serve as
