# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the pyrex Pyrex (borosilicate glass) laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while leveraging Pyrex's low thermal expansion coefficient (3.3 × 10⁻⁶/°C) to prevent thermal stress cracking. The process selectively ablates contaminants without damaging the underlying glass substrate.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows optical contamination and surface films adhering to the surface. The pyrex exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The pyrex substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
