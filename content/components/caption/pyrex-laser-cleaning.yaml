  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the pyrex glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The pyrex exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.8% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The pyrex substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with maintained optical clarity.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
