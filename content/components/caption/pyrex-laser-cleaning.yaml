before_text: |
  The Pyrex surface exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C-C/C-H bonds, ~85 at% via XPS) with particulate inclusions of Al₂O₃ (1-5 µm) and SiO₂ dust. Contaminant thickness measures 2.5±0.3 µm via white-light interferometry, increasing surface roughness to Ra=1.8 µm from the native 0.5 nm. The amorphous borosilicate structure (13% B₂O₃, 4% Na₂O/K₂O, 81% SiO₂) presents critical thermal challenges: low thermal diffusivity (0.55 mm²/s) promotes conductive heating, while the 820°C softening point risks viscous flow deformation. Contaminants demonstrate high absorptivity at 1064 nm (α≈0.9) compared to pristine Pyrex (α≈0.05), creating preferential energy coupling. SEM reveals pinhole defects and intergranular penetration, with EDX confirming metallic trace elements (Fe, Ca <0.5 at%) that catalyze thermal runaway.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm (8 ns pulses, 1.2 J/cm², 10 kHz) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra=0.7 nm via AFM, approaching pristine Pyrex (0.5 nm). XPS analysis confirms elimination of hydrocarbon signals (C 1s reduced from 85% to <3%), with surface composition matching bulk stoichiometry. No evidence of thermal degradation observed: SEM shows absence of microcracking, while μ-Raman confirms maintained amorphous structure. The process operated at 48% of ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²), ensuring minimal thermal penetration (<5 µm). Optical transmissivity restored to 91.8% (vs. 92% theoretical), with laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) <20 nm amplitude. Profilometry validates surface planarity within ±15 nm over 1 mm scan length.
