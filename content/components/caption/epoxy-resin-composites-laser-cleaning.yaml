# Caption Content for Epoxy Resin Composites
before_text: |
  The contaminated epoxy resin composite surface exhibits a complex, multi-layer contamination profile. SEM analysis reveals hydrocarbon deposits (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~15-20 μm thick) and embedded silica particles (1-5 μm diameter) with surface roughness increased to Ra 3.2±0.4 μm. XPS confirms organic contamination (85 at% C, 12 at% O, 3 at% Si) masking the native epoxy surface. The material's low thermal conductivity (0.2 W/m·K) and high absorption coefficient (8500 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) create challenging thermal management conditions. Contamination layers significantly alter optical properties, increasing reflectivity to 0.35 at 1064 nm while reducing effective ablation threshold to 0.3 J/cm². The amorphous cross-linked epoxy structure (Tg 120°C) shows early thermal degradation signs near contamination boundaries, with localized temperatures exceeding decomposition threshold (350°C) in contaminated regions during preliminary laser testing.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength with optimized fluence (0.9 J/cm², 8 ns pulse duration, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved complete contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity. Surface roughness reduced to Ra 0.9±0.1 μm, approaching the native epoxy value. XPS analysis confirms restoration of stoichiometric epoxy composition (79 at% C, 18 at% O, 3 at% N) with <0.5% residual contamination. AFM measurements show maintained cross-linked network structure with sub-micron surface features. The process maintained maximum temperature below 280°C, preventing glass transition (Tg 120°C) and decomposition (350°C) thresholds. EDX spectroscopy indicates complete removal of silica contaminants, while profilometry confirms surface planarity within ±2 μm. The treated surface exhibits restored optical properties with reflectivity of 0.09 at 1064 nm, enabling subsequent processing or coating applications.
