  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15 to 20 micrometers, it appears as a continuous, non-uniform film. The topography is dominated by particulate matter—carbonaceous soot and embedded silica particles, perhaps—which creates a very rough, textured landscape. EDX analysis confirms high carbon content and traces of sulfur, this suggests environmental deposition from combustion or industrial processes.

Original epoxy substrate, it is completely obscured. The contamination layer exhibits mud-cracking pattern, with fissure widths up to 5 µm. These cracks reveal darker subsurface, but no composite fibers are visible. Surface roughness is significant, with initial Ra measurements indicating values around 4.5 to 5.2 µm. The overall appearance is matte and dark, the reflectivity is very low because the porous contamination layer traps incident light. This degraded state, it would severely compromise any adhesive bonding or coating application.

  Laser cleaning process, it produces a dramatic surface transformation. At 500x, the contaminated layer is completely absent, the underlying epoxy matrix is now fully exposed. This reveals the true composite microstructure, including the fiber reinforcement pattern—carbon fibers are clearly visible, their alignment and distribution can be analyzed. Surface roughness decreases substantially, new Ra measurements are in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 µm. This is a very significant improvement.

The cleaning efficacy is nearly complete, only minor, isolated residues persist in some fiber-matrix interfaces. These appear as faint shadows under SEM, but their composition is primarily epoxy, not foreign contaminants. The surface texture becomes much more uniform, the previous mud-cracking is entirely eliminated. Reflectivity increases markedly, the surface now has a slight sheen, this indicates restoration of polymer integrity. For functional performance, this clean surface provides excellent conditions for subsequent processing.

Further analysis with XPS shows the chemical surface is now dominated by epoxy components, carbon and oxygen peaks are very strong. The atomic oxygen concentration increases to over 20%, this is consistent with a clean, oxidized polymer surface. Some minor sub-surface modification is possible—the laser energy can cause localized heating—but the surface integrity remains high. The process successfully restored
