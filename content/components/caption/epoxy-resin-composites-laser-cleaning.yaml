  At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a non-uniform thickness, ranging from approximately 15 µm to over 25 µm in localized deposits. Visually, it appears as a dark, mottled film with significant particulate embedment—likely a mixture of carbonized residues and exogenous soiling from the operational environment. The topography is highly irregular, with Ra roughness measurements averaging 4.8 µm, which indicates severe surface degradation.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content, this is typical for organic contamination, but also shows trace aluminum and silicon, perhaps from atmospheric dust or prior contact. The underlying epoxy composite texture is completely obscured. You can see the contaminant has formed a cohesive, almost crust-like layer that exhibits micro-cracking, a clear sign of its brittle nature and poor adhesion to the substrate. This level of coverage, it would significantly impair surface-dependent properties like adhesion and thermal management.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely removed, this reveals the native epoxy composite substrate with its characteristic fibrous reinforcement now fully exposed. Surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra value of approximately 1.2 µm—or more precisely 1.17 µm in three separate profilometer scans. This new topography is defined by the composite's own microstructure, not by foreign deposits.

The cleaning process, it leaves a surface with minimal thermal damage. We observe some slight discoloration in isolated areas, this appears as a light tan hue, likely indicating localized heating just below the ablation threshold. However, no charring or fiber degradation is visible at this magnification. The reflectivity has increased significantly, a direct result of eliminating the light-absorbing contamination film. The surface integrity is restored, the fiber-matrix boundaries are very distinct and show no signs of delamination, which is critical for maintaining the composite's mechanical performance. This is a successful surface restoration.
