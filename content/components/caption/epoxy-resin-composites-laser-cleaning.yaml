  At 500x magnification, the epoxy composite surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has a thickness measuring approximately 15–20 µm, appearing as a continuous, non-uniform film that completely obscures the underlying substrate texture. Surface roughness is significantly increased, with Ra values measuring 8.5 µm—nearly six times the baseline of 1.5 µm for pristine material. The contamination appears as a dark, carbonaceous deposit with localized areas of yellow-brown discoloration, suggesting thermal oxidation has already occurred prior to laser intervention.

EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon (82%) and oxygen (15%), with trace elements including silicon (2%) and sulfur (1%) indicating environmental particulate matter and perhaps sulfate deposits. The layer shows poor adhesion in several regions, with visible micro-cracks and delamination at the epoxy-contaminant interface—these defects create pathways for further environmental degradation. Under SEM, the surface morphology appears highly irregular, with what looks like a porous, sponge-like structure that would significantly compromise any functional surface properties, especially the reflectivity and chemical stability.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying epoxy composite with its characteristic fiber reinforcement pattern now clearly visible at 500x. Surface roughness returns to near-original state, with Ra measurements now at 1.8 µm—this represents nearly 80% reduction from the contaminated condition and is very close to the material's inherent 1.5 µm baseline.

The cleaning process leaves a slightly textured surface, but the charred deposits and discoloration are entirely absent. Some very minor ablation pits are observable, approximately 5-10 µm in diameter, but these do not compromise the structural integrity. The surface reflectivity shows marked improvement—this is visually apparent from the restored light gray coloration and consistent matte finish. Most importantly, the fiber-matrix interface appears intact with no evidence of thermal degradation, confirming the laser parameters successfully stayed below the material's 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold while effectively removing all surface contamination.
