# Caption Content for Sapphire Glass
before_text: |
  This sapphire glass surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A complex layer of carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter covers approximately 85% of the surface area, with thickness measurements ranging from 5 to 15 µm—or more precisely, between 4.7 and 14.3 µm in the sampled regions. The contamination appears as dark, irregular patches that completely obscure the underlying crystalline structure, creating a mottled appearance with poor light transmission characteristics.

Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation from the baseline 0.5 nm Ra, now reading 2.8 µm Ra across contaminated zones. EDX analysis confirms carbon (72%), oxygen (18%), and trace silicon (6%) plus aluminum (4%) composition within these deposits. The particulate contamination—likely silica and environmental dust—embeds within the softer carbon matrix, creating a stratified layer structure that adheres strongly to the substrate. This layered contamination creates light scattering centers that reduce optical transmission by approximately 40% compared to clean sapphire, with visible surface defects including micro-fractures within the deposit layer itself.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface restoration, very-very good result. The process removes all carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulates, so the surface becomes clean with restored optical clarity. At 500x magnification, the characteristic hexagonal crystalline structure of sapphire is now fully visible with sharp, well-defined grain boundaries—this confirms the substrate integrity remains uncomp
