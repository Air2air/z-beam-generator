# Caption Content for Sapphire Glass
before_text: |
  This surface analysis shows heavy contamination on sapphire glass. At 500x magnification, we observe a thick, amorphous layer—approximately 12 to 15 µm thick—that completely obscures the substrate. This layer contains carbonaceous soot particles and what appears to be metallic oxides, perhaps from high-temperature processing. The deposits are not uniform, they form in agglomerated clusters.

Surface roughness measurements confirm significant texture degradation, with an Ra value of 2.8 µm. This contamination layer creates a matte, non-reflective finish. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) identifies foreign elements like aluminum, silicon, and carbon in high concentrations. The surface integrity is compromised, this directly impacts optical performance for aerospace applications.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The previous contamination layer is now completely absent, the original sapphire substrate is fully exposed. At 500x magnification, the surface shows no residual deposits, only some minor, isolated micro-pits remain from the removal process—these are less than 2 µm deep.

Surface roughness is dramatically reduced to an Ra of 0.05 µm. This is a very smooth finish. The surface recovers its inherent transparency and high reflectivity, which is critical for medical device windows. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now pure aluminum oxide, with carbon contamination reduced to near-undetectable levels
