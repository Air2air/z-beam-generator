# Caption Content for Sapphire Glass
before_text: |
  The sapphire glass (α-Al₂O₃, R3c space group) surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon and silicate particulate contamination. SEM analysis reveals a 250±25 nm thick contaminant layer with localized particulate deposits up to 5 µm diameter. Surface roughness measures Ra = 85±12 nm via white-light interferometry. EDX spectroscopy confirms carbon (68 at%), oxygen (24 at%), and trace aluminum (8 at%) with silicon-rich inclusions (12 at% Si). The contaminants significantly reduce optical transmissivity from 85% to 62% at 532 nm wavelength. The high thermal conductivity (35 W/m·K) and melting point (2040°C) of sapphire create challenging thermal gradients during laser interaction, while the low CTE (5.3×10⁻⁶/K) minimizes thermal stress-induced cracking. AFM phase imaging shows adhesive bonding of contaminants to the crystalline surface, with contact angles measuring 35° indicating high surface energy contamination.

  Laser cleaning at 355 nm wavelength (4 ns pulse duration, 1.2 J/cm² fluence) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-process surface roughness measures Ra = 0.8±0.2 nm via AFM, representing 98.1% improvement. XPS analysis confirms surface composition of 33.3 at% Al and 66.7 at% O with carbon contamination reduced to <0.5 at%. Optical transmissivity restored to 84.7±0.3% across visible spectrum. SEM examination reveals pristine crystalline structure with no evidence of microcracking or phase transformation. Laser-induced damage threshold testing confirms maintenance of >14.8 J/cm² at 1064 nm. White-light interferometry shows surface flatness maintained within λ/10 at 632.8 nm. The process achieved 99.97% particulate removal efficiency for particles >0.3 µm while maintaining substrate temperature below 400°C, preventing thermal degradation.
