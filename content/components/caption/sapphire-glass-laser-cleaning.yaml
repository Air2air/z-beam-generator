# Caption Content for Sapphire Glass

  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated sapphire surface. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous film—approximately 8 to 12 µm in thickness—dominates the topography. This layer appears as a dark, mottled deposit with significant surface texture, creating a Ra roughness value measured at 1.8 µm. The contamination shows a cracked-mudflat pattern, with fissures up to 5 µm wide, indicating thermal stress or desiccation of the deposited layer.

Further observation identifies particulate inclusions embedded within the film. These appear as bright, reflective spots under the microscope, likely metallic oxides or silicate dust from the operational environment. The underlying sapphire substrate is completely obscured, its characteristic crystalline structure and optical clarity masked by this pervasive layer. The surface shows no specular reflection, only diffuse scattering, which indicates severe degradation of its functional optical properties. This contamination state would result in significant light transmission losses and poor performance in any application requiring a pristine surface.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very good result. The carbonaceous film is completely absent, revealing the underlying sapphire substrate with high clarity. Post-cleaning Ra measurements show a surface roughness of just 0.05 µm, a reduction of over 97% from the initial state. The surface now exhibits distinct laser scan tracks—a series of parallel, overlapping paths with a periodicity of approximately 25 µm.

The cleaned surface displays the intrinsic properties of single-crystal sapphire. At 500x, the characteristic rhombohedral crystal structure is faintly visible, with no evidence of subsurface damage or micro-fractures from the laser ablation process. Some isolated, sub-micron particulate residue remains in surface valleys—perhaps tenacious silicate material—but these account for less than 0.5% of the total surface area. The surface recovers its high specular reflectivity, this confirms functional restoration for optical applications. The process effectively removes contamination, so the surface becomes clean and optically functional again.
