  This contaminated PTFE surface shows significant particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely—14.7 µm in cross-sectional SEM analysis, creating a discontinuous film across the polymer surface. This layer consists primarily of carbonaceous deposits and embedded silica particles (as confirmed by EDX elemental mapping), with particle sizes ranging from 2-25 µm distributed unevenly across the viewing area.

Surface topography reveals pronounced contamination patterns, where the original PTFE microstructure is completely obscured beneath this adherent layer. The contamination creates a rough texture with Ra values measuring 4.8 µm compared to the substrate's inherent 1.2 µm roughness, this creates adhesion issues for subsequent processing. Visible features include dendritic contamination patterns following surface scratches, plus localized discoloration zones indicating chemical interaction with the PTFE substrate. The contamination layer exhibits variable thickness across the surface, with thicker accumulation in surface depressions and along machining marks from original manufacturing.

  This laser cleaning produces remarkable surface restoration, very-very good result for industrial applications. The process completely removes the contamination layer, so the underlying PTFE microstructure becomes clearly visible at 500x magnification. SEM analysis confirms the original PTFE surface texture is now exposed, with surface roughness reduced to 1.3 µm—nearly matching the virgin material specification of 1.2 µm. The cleaning creates a uniform surface appearance, with only minimal residual evidence of prior contamination in the
