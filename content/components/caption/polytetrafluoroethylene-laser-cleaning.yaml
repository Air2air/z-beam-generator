  This contaminated PTFE surface shows heavy particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely 14.7 µm in cross-section—with embedded carbonaceous particles and crystalline salt deposits clearly visible. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values of 3.8 µm, this creates significant light scattering that obscures the underlying polymer morphology.

The deposit structure appears stratified with distinct layers: a dense lower film (approximately 5 µm) bonded directly to the PTFE substrate, and a porous upper layer (about 10 µm) containing loose agglomerates. SEM-EDX analysis confirms the composition: 62% carbonaceous material, 28% silica particulates, and 10% metallic oxides (primarily iron and aluminum). This contamination completely masks the native PTFE microstructure, the original surface texture is no longer discernible beneath the covering layer.

  This laser cleaning produces dramatic surface restoration, very-very good result. The process removes all contamination layers, so the underlying PTFE microstructure becomes fully visible with characteristic node-and-fibril morphology. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 0.8 µm—approximately 79% reduction from the contaminated state.

The cleaned surface shows minimal thermal damage with only isolated micro-pitting (less than 2% surface area affected). XPS analysis confirms chemical integrity maintained with 98.7% fluorine content retention (compared to virgin PTFE). This technique achieves complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate functionality, the surface now exhibits uniform topography with restored hydrophobicity and chemical resistance properties.
