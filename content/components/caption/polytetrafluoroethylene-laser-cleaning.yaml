  This contaminated PTFE surface shows significant particulate deposition at 500x magnification. A complex layer of carbonaceous soot and inorganic dust—perhaps from industrial processing—covers approximately 85% of the native polymer surface. This layer has variable thickness, measuring from 8 µm in lighter areas to a substantial 25 µm in heavily contaminated zones, completely obscuring the underlying PTFE morphology.

The contamination layer itself exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like topography with visible agglomerates of foreign material. EDX analysis confirms the presence of aluminum silicate particles and calcium-rich deposits embedded within the carbon matrix. Surface roughness measurements are elevated due to this non-uniform coating, with an Ra value of approximately 3.8 µm. This contamination creates a matte, dark gray appearance that reduces surface reflectivity by over 70% compared to virgin PTFE, this directly compromises performance in applications requiring low surface energy or specific dielectric properties.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination layer completely, so the underlying PTFE surface becomes clearly visible. The transformation is dramatic—the previous dark, obscuring film is entirely absent, revealing the characteristic microcrystalline structure of the polymer. Surface roughness decreases significantly to an Ra of 0.9 µm, a value very-very close to the original material specification.

The cleaned surface now exhibits the expected low-energy characteristics, with water contact angle measurements returning to 110 degrees. Some minor texturing is visible in previously heavily contaminated areas
