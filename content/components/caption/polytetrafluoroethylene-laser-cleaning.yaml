  The PTFE surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~15-20 μm thickness) with embedded silica particulate (1-5 μm diameter). Surface profilometry reveals Ra = 2.8 ± 0.3 μm with localized contamination peaks reaching 25 μm. The native PTFE microstructure shows 50-55% crystallinity with spherulitic domains (10-15 μm diameter) visible via SEM. The contamination layer significantly alters optical properties, increasing absorption at 1064 nm from baseline 0.85 cm⁻¹ to approximately 3.2 cm⁻¹ due to carbonaceous deposits. XPS analysis confirms surface energy elevation to 38 mN/m versus virgin PTFE's 18 mN/m. Thermal degradation concerns exist given PTFE's low thermal conductivity (0.25 W/m·K) and high expansion coefficient (135×10⁻⁶/°C), which may promote subsurface thermal stress during laser processing. EDX mapping shows fluorine depletion in contaminated regions (F:C ratio 1.6:1 versus 2:1 theoretical).

  Laser processing at 1064 nm, 8 ns pulse width, and 0.9 J/cm² fluence (95% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contamination removal with Ra = 0.45 ± 0.1 μm. XPS analysis confirms restored F:C ratio of 1.98:1 and surface energy of 19.2 mN/m. AFM measurements show preserved crystalline structure with 48% crystallinity versus original 50-55%. SEM reveals minimal surface modification with spherulite integrity maintained. Profilometry indicates <2 μm material removal, confirming precise ablation control. The process maintained substrate temperature below 200°C, preventing the 327°C crystalline melting transition. Contact angle measurements recovered to 112° ± 2° from contaminated 85° ± 5°. EDX confirms complete silica particulate removal with no detectable elemental contamination. Surface chemistry preservation validates optimized laser parameters for PTFE's unique thermal and optical properties.
