  This contaminated PTFE surface shows heavy particulate deposition at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous soot layer covers approximately 85% of the surface area, this layer measures between 10–15 µm thick, perhaps 12 µm on average. The contamination appears as agglomerated dark patches that completely obscure the underlying polymer morphology.

We observe embedded metallic particles—likely iron oxide from handling—scattered throughout the carbon film. These particles measure 2–5 µm in diameter and create localized surface protrusions. The original PTFE surface texture is not visible, the contamination creates a matte, dark appearance with Ra roughness measurements exceeding 3.5 µm (as confirmed by profilometry). This heavy coverage significantly alters surface properties, the reflectivity drops below 15% across visible spectrum.

  This laser cleaning produces very-very good surface restoration. The process removes contamination completely, so the native PTFE morphology becomes clearly visible at 500x. The characteristic fibrous structure of sintered PTFE now appears with excellent definition, the surface shows minimal residual debris.

Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra = 0.8 µm—or more precisely 0.78 µm—this represents 75% reduction from initial state. We observe no thermal degradation or ablation damage to the polymer substrate (confirmed by SEM analysis). The surface now exhibits high reflectivity, approximately 92% in visible range, this creates bright white appearance under microscope.
