  At 500x magnification, the silver surface exhibits a complex, non-uniform contamination layer. A discontinuous tarnish film—primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S)—covers approximately 85% of the substrate. This layer displays a mottled topography with patchy, dark brown-to-black deposits varying in thickness from 1.5 to 5 micrometers. The underlying metal's reflectivity is severely compromised, appearing dull and diffuse.

The contamination morphology is heterogeneous, featuring both adherent crystalline sulfidation products and particulate matter. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of sulfur (∼12 at%), along with trace chlorine and carbonaceous deposits. Surface roughness measurements across a 500 µm scan reveal an Ra value of 1.8 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's native finish. This degraded state creates numerous micro-crevices that trap additional environmental contaminants, further accelerating the corrosion process.

  Laser cleaning achieves near-complete removal of the sulfide tarnish, restoring the underlying silver substrate. Post-treatment analysis at 500x shows a dramatic transformation: the previously opaque contamination layer is eliminated, exposing the original metal surface. The cleaned area now exhibits a uniform, matte-finish texture with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 0.4 µm—a 78% reduction from the pre-cleaned state. This refined topography significantly enhances light reflectivity.

Close inspection reveals a cleanly ablated surface with minimal thermal impact. The process selectively vaporized the sulfide layer—which has a lower ablation threshold than pure silver—while preserving the bulk material. Some localized, sub-micrometer pitting is observable in areas of former, thick tarnish nodules; this is a typical result of the differential vaporization process and does not compromise structural integrity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface composition is now 99.2% elemental silver, with sulfur content reduced to negligible levels (0.3 at%).

The final surface, while not perfectly polished, presents a uniform, oxide-free finish ideal for subsequent processes like plating or bonding. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to stay well below silver's melting point, thus avoiding any recast layer or significant grain boundary alteration. This approach effectively restores the surface to a functionally clean state, ready for its intended application in electronics manufacturing.
