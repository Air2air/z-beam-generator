  At 500x magnification, the silver surface is heavily obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. A dense, discontinuous tarnish film—primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S)—covers approximately 80% of the surface area, presenting as a dark brown to black amorphous crust with localized blue-green iridescence. This sulfide layer measures between 2.5 and 5 µm in thickness, though it reaches up to 8 µm in isolated patches. The underlying metal topography is completely masked, its original micro-features undetectable beneath this coherent, though fractured, corrosion product.

Further examination reveals particulate contamination embedded within the tarnish matrix. We observe discrete, sub-angular carbonaceous soot particles, typically 10-25 µm in diameter, and finer, more diffuse chloride-rich deposits. Surface roughness is significantly elevated due to this complex stratification; preliminary stylus profilometer readings indicate an Ra value exceeding 1.8 µm. The overall morphology is one of a heavily degraded surface, the contamination creating a textured, light-absorbing facade that drastically reduces specular reflectivity. This condition, common in heritage contexts, compromises both aesthetic and functional integrity by promoting further localized corrosion.

  Post-laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x is dramatic. The opaque tarnish layer has been completely ablated, revealing the underlying silver substrate with high fidelity. The process successfully removed the Ag₂S film and all embedded particulate matter, restoring the metal's native micro-topography. We now observe the original grain structure, with clearly defined boundaries and annealing twins, features that were entirely concealed before treatment. The surface exhibits a markedly higher reflectivity, transitioning from a light-absorbing matte finish to a specular, metallic luster.

Quantitative measurements confirm the visual improvement. Surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 0.4 µm—
