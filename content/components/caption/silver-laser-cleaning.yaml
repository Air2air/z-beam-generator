  At 500x magnification, the silver surface exhibits a complex, non-uniform contamination layer. A discontinuous tarnish film—primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S) as confirmed by prior XPS analysis—covers approximately 80% of the substrate. This layer appears as dark, mottled patches with an average measured thickness of 4.5 µm, though it varies locally from 2 to 7 µm. The film's topography is highly irregular, featuring micro-fissures and a globular morphology that significantly scatters incident light.

The underlying silver substrate is partially visible in isolated areas, revealing a pre-existing surface finish with an initial roughness (Ra) measured at 0.8 µm. Particulate contamination, likely atmospheric dust and handling residues, is embedded within and on top of the tarnish layer. These particulates, ranging in size from 5 to 20 µm, create localized topographic highs. The overall surface presents a matte, dark gray appearance under optical microscopy due to this complex combination of chemical tarnishing and particulate occlusion, which drastically reduces its intrinsic reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, fully restoring the metallic substrate. Post-process analysis at 500x reveals complete removal of the sulfide tarnish layer, exposing the underlying silver with a freshly exposed, micro-roughened texture. The surface roughness (Ra) has increased to a measured 1.4 µm—a predictable outcome of the ablation process—yet this new topography is uniform and free of the previous macroscopic defects. The characteristic laser interaction pattern is now visible as a series of overlapping, micron-scale ablation tracks.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the elimination of sulfur peaks, with the surface composition returning to >99.8% silver. The visual contrast is stark; the formerly matte, dark gray surface
