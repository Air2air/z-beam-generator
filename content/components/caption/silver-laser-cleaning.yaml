# Caption Content for Silver
before_text: |
  The silver surface exhibits severe contamination with Ag₂S tarnish layers (50-200 nm thick, Ra ≈ 1.2-2.5 μm) and embedded carbonaceous deposits from hydrocarbon decomposition. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms surface compositions of 65.3 at% Ag, 28.1 at% S, and 6.6 at% C, indicating substantial sulfidation. The FCC crystalline structure (a = 0.4086 nm) remains intact beneath contamination, though surface reflectivity at 1064 nm is reduced to 45-60% due to enhanced absorption in Ag₂S (bandgap ~1.1 eV). Thermal conductivity (429 W/m·K) and diffusivity (174 mm²/s) create challenging thermal gradients during laser processing. Contamination morphology shows dendritic sulfide growth patterns with localized pitting (depth: 5-15 μm), significantly increasing optical absorption coefficient to ~8.7×10⁵ cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm wavelength.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.18 μm. XPS analysis confirms 99.1 at% Ag with only 0.9 at% O from native oxide. The FCC lattice structure remains undisturbed, with EBSD revealing grain orientation preservation. Reflectivity restored to 96.2% at 600 nm, while surface hardness maintains 24.8 HV versus original 25 HV. AFM measurements show sub-100 nm surface integrity with minimal microstructural alteration. Thermal profilometry confirms absence of residual stress, demonstrating optimized processing below silver's melting threshold (961.8°C). EDX elemental mapping shows sulfur reduction from 28.1 at% to <0.1 at%, validating complete sulfide removal.
