  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the silver Silver laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove surface contaminants through ablation while preserving the high-purity silver substrate, leveraging silver's exceptional thermal conductivity (429 W/m·K) for controlled energy dissipation.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The silver exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The silver substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
