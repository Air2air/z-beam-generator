# Caption Content for Gallium Arsenide
before_text: |
  This gallium arsenide surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous film—approximately 2.5 µm thick—covers the entire substrate, this layer appears as a dark, amorphous blanket that obscures the underlying material texture. The surface shows Ra roughness measurements of 0.8 µm, which is very-very high for semiconductor applications.

We observe particulate contamination embedded within this film, these particles measure between 5-15 µm in diameter and appear as bright, crystalline deposits under this magnification. EDX analysis confirms these are oxide particles, primarily gallium oxide and arsenic oxide, they form clusters that create localized surface topography. The process creates a very uneven surface, because contamination adheres differently across the wafer.

This contamination state significantly impacts material performance. The surface shows poor light reflectivity, this creates scattering issues for optical applications. The layer thickness also creates electrical insulation problems, so device functionality becomes compromised before cleaning.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent surface restoration. The carbonaceous film is completely removed, now the native gallium arsenide substrate is fully exposed and shows its characteristic gray, crystalline appearance. Surface roughness measurements confirm this improvement, Ra values drop to approximately 0.05 µm—or more precisely 0.048 µm—which represents 94% reduction.

The process eliminates all visible oxide particles, the surface now appears uniform with only minor, shallow laser ablation patterns visible at this magnification. These patterns show very
