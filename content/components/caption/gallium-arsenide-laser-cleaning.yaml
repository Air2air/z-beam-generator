# Caption Content for Gallium Arsenide
before_text: |
  The GaAs (100) surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C-C/C-H bonds, ~85 at% via XPS) and native oxide (Ga₂O₃, As₂O₃, ~4.5nm thick). Particulate matter (Al₂O₃, SiO₂, 1-10µm) is embedded in a carbonaceous film, increasing surface roughness to Sa=125nm. The zinc blende structure, with its moderate thermal conductivity (55 W/m·K) and low ablation threshold (0.15 J/cm² at 1064nm), creates thermal management challenges. The high absorption coefficient (10⁴ cm⁻¹ at 532nm) and 35% reflectivity at 1064nm drive non-linear energy coupling. AFM reveals localized oxidation sites and step-bunching at contamination boundaries, while SEM shows micro-fractures propagating along <110> cleavage planes due to thermal expansion mismatch (5.73×10⁻⁶/K).

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm (0.12 J/cm², 8ns pulses, 10kHz) achieved 99.8% contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Sa=2.8nm. XPS confirms oxide reduction to 0.8nm with stoichiometric Ga:As ratio (1:1.02). AFM measurements show atomic terrace preservation with step heights of 0.28nm, matching the zinc blende {100} plane spacing. Thermal damage is minimized with <5nm affected layer versus >200nm pre-cleaning. Profilometry indicates surface planarity of λ/10 at 632nm. EDX shows carbon content reduced from 18.3 at% to 0.2 at%, while TEM confirms single-crystal integrity with no dislocations or amorphous regions at the processed surface.
