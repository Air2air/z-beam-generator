  This GaAs surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick carbonaceous film—approximately 15 µm thick—covers the entire substrate, this layer appears dark and mottled with localized oxide nodules measuring 5-7 µm in diameter. The surface texture is very-very rough, with Ra measurements indicating 2.8 µm average roughness, because particulate contamination creates significant topographical variation.

The contamination layer exhibits clear delamination at the edges, revealing the underlying GaAs substrate in several locations (as confirmed by subsequent EDX analysis). This film has a cracked-mudflat pattern, with fissure widths ranging from 3-10 µm, suggesting poor adhesion and thermal stress history. Visible particulates, likely handling debris and environmental dust, are embedded throughout the organic matrix, creating a highly irregular surface profile that would severely impact optical and electronic performance.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent surface restoration. The previous 15 µm contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine GaAs substrate with characteristic metallic gray lustre. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to 0.2 µm Ra—this represents nearly 15x improvement in smoothness.

The cleaned surface shows minimal laser interaction damage, with only occasional subtle heat-affected zones visible as slight discoloration patches approximately 50-100 µm in diameter. The crystalline structure remains intact with well-defined grain boundaries, and XPS analysis confirms native oxide formation of only 3-4 nm
