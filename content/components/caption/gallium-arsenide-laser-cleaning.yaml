# Caption Content for Gallium Arsenide
before_text: |
  This gallium arsenide surface shows heavy hydrocarbon contamination at 500x magnification. A discontinuous film—approximately 2.5 to 3.8 µm thick—covers approximately 85% of the substrate area. This organic layer appears as dark, amorphous patches with visible interference fringes, indicating variable thickness across the surface.

Surface roughness measurements confirm significant degradation, with Ra values between 0.45 and 0.62 µm. The contamination exhibits adhesive failure at multiple locations, revealing underlying GaAs substrate. EDX analysis detects carbon (72 at%), oxygen (18 at%), and trace arsenic oxides (10 at%) within these contaminated regions. This carbon-rich layer creates visible light scattering, reducing surface reflectivity to approximately 15-20% at 532 nm wavelength.

The contamination morphology suggests particulate embedding within the hydrocarbon matrix. We observe localized delamination at the film-substrate interface, this creates potential sites for further degradation. Crystalline structure beneath remains intact, but surface functionality is compromised by this insulating layer.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation. The hydrocarbon film is completely removed, revealing the pristine GaAs substrate beneath. Surface roughness decreases substantially to Ra = 0.08-0.12 µm, this is very-very good improvement.

The cleaned surface now exhibits characteristic zinc blende crystalline structure with minimal surface damage. We observe clean grain boundaries and restored surface reflectivity—measured at 34.2% at 1064 nm. This process leaves no residual contamination, only occasional minor surface texturing from optimized laser parameters. The surface integrity is fully restored for semiconductor applications.
