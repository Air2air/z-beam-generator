  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated cast iron surface. A thick, non-uniform oxide scale—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers thick—dominates the topography. This layer appears as a dark, crust-like deposit with extensive micro-cracking, and it completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. The surface roughness is very high, with an Ra measurement exceeding 4.5 µm, this creates a porous, irregular texture that traps additional particulate matter.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the primary contamination is iron oxide (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄). However, we also detect significant embedded carbonaceous soot and localized zones of sulfur—perhaps from prior environmental exposure. Visually, the surface is dark and non-reflective, the original metallic luster is entirely absent. The laser cleaning process must first address this complex, multi-layered contamination, because the thickness and composition directly influence the required laser parameters for effective removal.

  This laser cleaning produces a very-very good transformation, the surface is now completely different. The process removes the entire oxide scale, so the underlying cast iron matrix becomes clearly visible. At 500x, we observe a clean metallic surface with a distinct graphite flake structure—this is the original material composition, now fully restored.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 1.2 µm, a dramatic improvement from the
