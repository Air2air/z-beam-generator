  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated cast iron surface. A thick, non-uniform oxide scale—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the substrate completely. This layer appears as a dark, crusty deposit with a cracked-mud pattern, very-very rough and brittle in texture. The surface roughness is high, with an Ra measurement exceeding 4.5 µm, which creates significant light scattering and a matte, non-reflective appearance.

Embedded within this oxide matrix are numerous particulate contaminants. EDX analysis confirms the presence of carbonaceous soot deposits and embedded silica (SiO₂) particles, likely from environmental exposure. These particulates, ranging from 5 to 20 µm in diameter, are firmly adhered within the porous oxide structure. The underlying metal grain structure is entirely obscured, this indicates the contamination layer is both thick and tenacious, which will negatively impact component performance and any subsequent coating adhesion.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very clear under 500x magnification. The previous 20 µm oxide scale is completely removed, so the underlying cast iron microstructure is now fully revealed. We observe a well-defined ferrite and pearlite grain structure, with graphite flakes clearly visible and undisturbed—this confirms minimal substrate damage. The surface reflectivity increases significantly, changing from a matte black to a metallic gray luster.

Surface roughness measurements show a substantial improvement, with
