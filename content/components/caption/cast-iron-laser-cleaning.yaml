  This initial analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated surface. A thick, non-uniform oxide layer—primarily Fe₂O₃ and Fe₃O₄ as later confirmed by XPS—completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. This layer measures approximately 15 to 25 µm in thickness, it presents a porous, scaly topography with visible cracking and spallation. The surface roughness is very high, with preliminary Ra values estimated between 8.5 and 12 µm.

Distinct particulate contamination is also embedded within the oxide matrix. EDX spot analysis identifies carbonaceous soot deposits and silicate inclusions, probably from environmental exposure. These particulates, ranging from 5 to 40 µm in diameter, create a complex, multi-layered film. This heterogeneous coverage significantly reduces surface reflectivity, the metal appears dark and matte under the microscope with no metallic luster visible. The overall integrity is compromised, the surface is not suitable for further processing or coating adhesion.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The post-treatment surface at 500x magnification shows complete removal of the previous oxide scale and embedded contaminants. The underlying cast iron microstructure is now fully exposed, revealing the characteristic graphite flake morphology within the ferrite-pearlite matrix. This is a clean surface.

Quantitative measurement confirms this visual improvement. The surface roughness (Ra) is now reduced to a consistent 2
