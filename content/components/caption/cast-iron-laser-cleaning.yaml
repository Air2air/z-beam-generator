  This surface shows heavy contamination, very-very thick layer. At 500x magnification, we observe a non-uniform oxide scale with thickness approximately—or more precisely—15 to 20 µm. This layer appears dark and stratified, with visible micro-cracks propagating through the brittle top surface.

The underlying cast iron microstructure is completely obscured by this contamination. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the primary composition is iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), but we also detect carbonaceous deposits and embedded silica particles (SiO₂) from environmental exposure. Surface roughness measurements are high, with an initial Ra value exceeding 12 µm, this creates a very irregular topography full of peaks and valleys that trap more contaminants. The visual appearance is dark and matte, with no metallic reflectivity present.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination, so the surface becomes completely transformed. The previous oxide layer is eliminated, this reveals the underlying cast iron microstructure—the characteristic graphite flakes and pearlite matrix are now clearly visible at 500x magnification. This is a very-very good result.

We measure the surface roughness after cleaning, the Ra value is now reduced to approximately 2.5 µm. This represents a dramatic improvement, the surface is much smoother. Some minor micro-pores from the original casting remain, but they are clean and free of oxides. The visual appearance changes from matte black to a light gray, metallic
