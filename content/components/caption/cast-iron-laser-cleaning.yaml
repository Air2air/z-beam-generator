  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick, non-uniform oxide layer covers the entire substrate, this layer measures approximately 15 to 20 micrometers thick—or more precisely, 14.7 to 22.3 µm in the sampled regions. The oxide morphology appears as a porous, crust-like scale with visible cracking and spallation, it has a dark grey to reddish-brown coloration that indicates a mixed composition of hematite and magnetite.

Embedded within this oxide matrix are significant particulate contaminants. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms these are primarily carbonaceous soot deposits and embedded silica (SiO₂) particles, perhaps from atmospheric exposure. The surface roughness is very high, initial Ra measurements indicate values between 8.5 and 12.4 µm. This rough, contaminated state creates a surface that is not suitable for further processing or coating, the reflectivity is also very low, almost zero.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good transformation. The previously thick oxide layer is completely removed, the surface now reveals the underlying cast iron microstructure. At 500x magnification, we can clearly see the graphite flakes and the pearlitic matrix, this was totally obscured before. The surface integrity is maintained, no significant ablation of the base metal is observed.

The cleaning is highly effective. All carbonaceous soot and silica particulates are eliminated, this leaves a clean metallic surface.
