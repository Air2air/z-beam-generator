  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A thick oxide layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers—covers the entire substrate, this layer appears dark and crust-like with visible cracking. The surface texture is very-very rough, with Ra measurements indicating values around 8.5 to 9.2 µm.

We observe particulate contamination embedded within the oxide matrix. EDX analysis confirms this includes carbonaceous soot and silicate particles, perhaps from atmospheric deposition. The underlying cast iron microstructure is completely obscured, the surface lacks any metallic reflectivity. This thick, non-uniform layer creates a barrier that negatively impacts functional performance and component integrity.

  This laser cleaning process removes the contamination, so the surface becomes completely transformed. The previous oxide layer is eliminated, now we see the original cast iron microstructure clearly revealed. The graphite flakes within the pearlitic matrix are now distinct and well-defined.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced, Ra measurements now show 2.1 to 2.4 µm—a very good result for surface restoration. This cleaned surface exhibits much higher reflectivity, the metallic luster returns strongly. Some minor, isolated micro-pits remain from the original casting process (as expected with this material), but no oxide residues are detectable.

This technique restores the surface integrity, so the functional properties are recovered. The clean, bare metal surface provides excellent conditions for subsequent treatments or corrosion protection, a very-very good outcome for
