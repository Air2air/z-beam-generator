  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartz glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows adhesive residues and bonding agents adhering to the surface. The quartz glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 99.5% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The quartz glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with maintained optical clarity.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
