  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the quartz glass glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The quartz glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The quartz glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved transparency.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
