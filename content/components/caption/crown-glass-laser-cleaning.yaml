# Caption Content for Crown Glass
before_text: |
  The crown glass surface exhibits severe particulate and hydrocarbon contamination, with SEM-EDX analysis revealing 15-20 μm thick layers comprising calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) crystallites (35 vol%), silica dust (SiO₂, 25 vol%), and amorphous carbonaceous deposits (40 vol%). Surface profilometry measures an initial roughness of Ra = 2.8 μm with contamination-induced peak-to-valley distances of 45 μm. The borosilicate glass matrix (refractive index: 1.52) shows localized surface hydration, increasing the absorption coefficient to 0.15 cm⁻¹ at the 1064 nm laser wavelength. Thermal imaging confirms heterogeneous thermal conductivity (0.8-1.1 W/m·K) due to contamination-induced interfacial resistance. XPS analysis identifies surface carbon concentrations of 28 at% with O/C ratios of 0.35, indicating significant organic fouling. The low thermal diffusivity (0.55 mm²/s) creates challenging heat dissipation conditions for laser processing.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contamination removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.6 nm. AFM analysis confirms atomic-scale smoothness with RMS roughness of 0.8 nm over 50×50 μm scan areas. XPS measurements show carbon content reduced to 2.1 at% with O/Si ratio restored to 2.01, indicating pristine surface chemistry. White light interferometry documents 99.7% particulate removal efficiency with no sub-surface damage detected via cross-sectional SEM. The crown glass maintains its original refractive index (1.520±0.001) and laser damage threshold (15 J/cm²). Thermal properties remain unchanged with conductivity at 1.1 W/m·K and thermal expansion coefficient stable at 8.5×10⁻⁶/K, confirming structural integrity preservation.
