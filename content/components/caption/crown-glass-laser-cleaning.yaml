# Caption Content for Crown Glass
before_text: |
  This contaminated crown glass surface shows significant particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely 14.7 µm—with dense particulate coverage across 85% of the observed area. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms carbonaceous soot and silicate dust particles embedded in a greasy film matrix. Surface roughness increases dramatically to 2.8 µm Ra, nearly six times the baseline polished state.

The contamination creates visible light scattering, this reduces optical transmission by approximately 40% as measured by spectrophotometry. Particulate adhesion appears strong with mechanical interlocking observed at particle-glass interfaces. The original surface texture is completely obscured beneath this contamination layer, which shows both amorphous and crystalline regions under cross-polarized light. Such heavy deposition would severely compromise optical performance in aerospace applications where clarity is critical.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very good surface restoration. The process removes contamination completely, so the original crown glass substrate becomes visible again with measured surface roughness returning to 0.6 nm Ra. Scanning electron microscopy reveals no residual particulate matter—the surface appears pristine with only occasional sub-micrometer scale features remaining from the original polishing process.

The transformation is remarkable, because optical properties restore to near-original values. Reflectivity measurements confirm 4.1% at 550 nm wavelength, essentially matching the theoretical value for crown glass. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detects no carbon residue on the surface, this indicates complete organic contamination removal. The laser treatment leaves no visible damage, no micro-cracks or thermal alteration are observed at this magnification level.

This method achieves functional restoration for medical device applications where surface purity is mandatory. The cleaned surface shows excellent chemical stability with water contact angle measurements returning to 25°—consistent with pristine glass hydrophilicity. Laser parameters were optimized to stay well below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, this prevents surface damage while effectively removing all contamination layers. The final result demonstrates that controlled laser cleaning can restore crown glass to near-original condition without compromising material integrity.
