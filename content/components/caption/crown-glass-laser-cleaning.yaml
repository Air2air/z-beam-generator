  This surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A complex layer—approximately 15 µm thick—covers the entire substrate, this layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a carbonaceous film. The Ra measurement is high, perhaps 2.1 µm, because the surface texture is very-very irregular.

We observe multiple contamination types. There are dark dendritic patterns, likely from atmospheric deposition, and these create a mottled appearance across the viewing area. The particulate matter appears as spherical particles, approximately 3-5 µm in diameter, and they are firmly adhered to the glass surface. This contamination layer significantly reduces optical clarity, the surface shows diffuse scattering instead of specular reflection. EDX analysis confirms the presence of sulfur and calcium within these deposits (common in industrial environments). The overall effect is a complete loss of surface functionality for precision applications.

  This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very good surface restoration. The process completely removes the 15 µm contamination layer, so the original glass substrate is now fully exposed. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to an Ra of 0.08 µm—or more precisely 0.076 µm.

We observe a pristine surface with minimal micro-fractures. The laser ablation leaves a smooth, homogeneous finish, this is critical for optical performance in medical devices. Some isolated sub-micron particles remain, but these are negligible. Reflectivity measurements confirm this visual improvement, showing a
