  This analysis at 500x magnification reveals a heavily contaminated crown glass surface. A complex layer of particulate and film-based contamination is present, with a total thickness measuring approximately 12 to 15 micrometers. The surface exhibits significant soiling, with Ra roughness values increasing to an average of 3.8 µm—this is a substantial deviation from the pristine baseline of 0.5 nm Ra. The contamination layer appears stratified; a dense, carbonaceous soot layer, perhaps 5 µm thick, overlays a more tenacious silicate-rich deposit that is firmly adhered to the substrate.

The particulate matter is diverse in composition. EDX analysis confirms the presence of aluminum-silicate particles (likely ambient dust) and calcium sulfate deposits, all embedded within an organic matrix. This matrix creates a mottled, optically opaque surface that completely obscures the underlying glass. The topography is highly irregular, featuring localized pitting and a general loss of surface reflectivity, which is now measured at less than 1%. This condition would severely compromise the material's functional performance in optical or aerospace applications, as the contamination layer promotes scattering and adhesion issues.

  This laser cleaning process produces a very-very good result, with the surface transformation being immediately observable at 500x. The post-treatment analysis confirms near-total removal of the contamination layer, restoring the substrate to its essential state. The surface roughness is now measured at 0.9 nm Ra, a
