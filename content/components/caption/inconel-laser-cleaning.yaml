# Caption Content for Inconel
before_text: |
  The Inconel 718 surface exhibits a complex contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick, comprising thermochemically grown Cr₂O₃/Al₂O₃ scales (8-12 µm) beneath carbonaceous deposits (5-8 µm) with embedded Fe-rich particulate contamination. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra = 3.8 ± 0.4 µm with localized pitting. The FCC gamma matrix, containing γ' [Ni₃(Al,Ti)] and γ'' [Ni₃Nb] precipitates, presents challenging thermal characteristics: low thermal conductivity (11.4 W/m·K) promotes heat accumulation, while the high melting point (1336°C) necessitates precise energy control. Reflectivity at 1064 nm is reduced to 0.22 due to surface oxidation, increasing absorption coefficient to 0.78. EDX analysis confirms 18.2 at% O, 6.8 at% C, and 2.3 at% Fe contamination, compromising the native oxidation resistance (1100°C service limit).

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface oxygen to 2.1 at% and carbon to 0.8 at% via XPS analysis. Surface roughness improved to Ra = 0.45 ± 0.1 µm, with profilometry confirming < 5 µm material removal. The FCC crystalline structure remains intact, with SEM revealing preserved γ'/γ'' precipitate distribution. Microhardness testing maintains 34.8 HRC versus original 35 HRC, demonstrating negligible thermal degradation. Laser parameters were optimized below the ablation threshold (2.5 J/cm²) to prevent recast layer formation. AFM measurements show sub-micron periodicity laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with 650 nm spacing, enhancing surface area while maintaining chemical integrity.
