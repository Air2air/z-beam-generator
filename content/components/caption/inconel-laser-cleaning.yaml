  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the inconel metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The inconel exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 99.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The inconel substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while maintaining material properties.
