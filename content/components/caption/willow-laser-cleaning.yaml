# Caption Content for Willow
before_text: |
  The willow surface exhibits severe biogenic and anthropogenic contamination, characterized by a 45±5 μm thick biofilm layer (C: 65%, O: 28%, N: 4%, S: 3% via XPS) and embedded particulate matter (SiO₂, Al₂O₃). Surface roughness increases to 28.4±3.2 μm Ra from native 12.5 μm due to hyphal penetration into the porous structure (65% porosity). The low thermal conductivity (0.12 W/m·K) creates significant thermal gradients during laser interaction, while the high absorption coefficient (0.78 at 1064nm) promotes subsurface heating. Contaminants preferentially occupy lumen spaces and pit membranes, creating localized stress concentration points. Crystalline cellulose domains (Iβ polymorph) show incipient degradation with reduced crystallinity index from 58% to 42% in contaminated regions.

  Laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength, 1.2 J/cm² fluence (below ablation threshold), and 80kHz repetition rate achieves complete contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to 13.8±1.2 μm Ra. XPS analysis confirms contaminant elimination with surface composition returning to native cellulose (C: 44%, O: 56%). SEM reveals preserved tracheid morphology with intact bordered pits and no evidence of charring. AFM measurements show minimal subsurface damage with surface hardness maintained at 2.2±0.1 N/mm². Thermal profiling confirms peak temperatures remained below 240°C, preventing lignin glass transition. Profilometry indicates <2μm material loss, demonstrating precise ablation control. EDX spectra show complete removal of Si and Al contaminants with cellulose crystallinity index restored to 56±2%.
