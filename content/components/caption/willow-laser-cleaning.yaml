# Caption Content for Willow
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the willow surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits that completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. This layer, which measures between 40 and 60 micrometers in thickness, exhibits a heterogeneous composition; energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of carbonaceous soot particles, silicate-based atmospheric dust, and sporadic biological growth, all bound within a discontinuous organic matrix, perhaps from prior, unsuitable conservation attempts. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a calculated average roughness (Ra) exceeding 25 µm, a direct consequence of the particulate matter and the degraded, friable varnish residues that have coalesced into a brittle, opaque film.

The inherent porosity of the willow substrate, which is approximately 65%, has facilitated the deep penetration of these contaminants, creating a sub-surface zone of discoloration that is visibly distinct from the bulk wood beneath the primary deposit layer. One can observe that the original cellular structure of the wood, the vessels and rays, is entirely masked, with only the most prominent growth ring boundaries faintly discernible as subtle undulations beneath the contaminant crust. This occlusion, it significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties, reducing its native reflectivity—measured at a baseline of 0.15—to nearly zero while imparting a dark, blotchy appearance that is both visually disruptive and mechanically unstable, as the differing coefficients of thermal expansion between the wood and the contaminant layer promote micro-cracking at their interface.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound transformation, where the contaminant stratum has been selectively ablated to expose the pristine willow substrate beneath. The surface now exhibits the distinct, open cellular structure of the wood, with clearly defined vessels and parenchyma rays visible across the entire field of view, a testament to the precision of the laser interaction which has effectively removed the foreign material without exceeding the ablation threshold of approximately 1.8 J/cm² for the wood itself. The measured surface roughness (Ra) has been substantially reduced to a value between 4.7 and 6.2 µm, a figure that corresponds well with the natural texture of sound willow and indicates the absence of mechanical gouging or thermal degradation.

What is particularly striking is the cleanliness of the lumens within the wood cells; they are now free of particulate matter, and the original light-toned coloration of the lignin and cellulose has been restored, which consequently increases the surface reflectivity back towards its inherent value. The laser parameters, they were evidently calibrated with great care to utilize the differential in thermal destruction points—the
