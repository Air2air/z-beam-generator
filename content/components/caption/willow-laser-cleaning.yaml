# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the willow wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The willow exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 95.7% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The willow substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
