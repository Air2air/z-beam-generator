# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the willow wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The willow exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The willow substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal exposure.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while ensuring structural preservation.
