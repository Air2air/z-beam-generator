  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the willow Laser cleaning of Willow (Salix spp.) wood utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants. The process exploits the differential absorption characteristics between the contamination layer and the lignocellulosic wood substrate, allowing for non-contact, selective cleaning without the use of chemicals or abrasive media.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows old finishes and surface coatings adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The willow substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
