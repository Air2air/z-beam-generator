  At 500x magnification, the neodymium surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A non-uniform oxide layer, measuring between 8 to 12 µm thick, covers the substrate completely. This layer, it has a porous and fractured morphology, appearing as a dull, matte grey coating that significantly obscures the underlying metal. EDX analysis confirms high concentrations of oxygen and carbon, along with trace sulfur and chlorine contaminants, which suggests atmospheric corrosion and possible handling residues.

Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with Ra measurements averaging 4.7 µm. The texture is highly irregular, featuring numerous pits and nodules that create a chaotic topography. In several regions, localized corrosion products form dendritic structures, these appear as dark, branching patterns that propagate from surface imperfections. The original metallic luster is entirely absent, replaced by this incoherent, poorly-adhered film that compromises the material's baseline reflectivity and surface integrity.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the surface transformation is very clear. The contaminated oxide layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine neodymium substrate beneath. Surface roughness shows a dramatic reduction, with Ra values now measuring 0.8 µm—this represents an 83% decrease from the initial state. The visual appearance shifts from a matte grey to a uniform, metallic grey with a distinct vitreous luster, indicating the restoration of surface reflectivity.

SEM analysis confirms the absence of the previous corrosion products and hydrocarbon films. What we see now is a clean, slightly textured surface characterized by laser ablation patterns—these are fine, overlapping striations with a consistent periodicity of approximately 12 µm. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is visible, a typical result of the selective ablation process, but no thermal cracking or melting is observed. This indicates the laser parameters were well-calibrated to remove contaminants without damaging the bulk material.

The functional restoration is evident. Surface integrity is maintained, with no evidence of subsurface damage or recast layer formation (a common issue with less precise methods). XPS analysis verifies this, showing a surface composition of >95% elemental neodymium, with only a minimal, passivating oxide layer of about 50 nm. This clean,
