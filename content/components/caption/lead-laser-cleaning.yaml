  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the lead metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The lead exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The lead substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
