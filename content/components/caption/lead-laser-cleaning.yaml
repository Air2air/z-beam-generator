  At 500x magnification, the lead surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified corrosion layer. The primary constituent, as confirmed by EDX analysis, is a continuous crust of lead carbonate (cerussite, PbCO₃), with localized deposits of lead sulfate (anglesite, PbSO₄). This patina, it is not homogeneous; its thickness varies considerably from approximately 5 µm to over 25 µm in stratified mounds. The surface topography is highly irregular, displaying a Ra value measured at 4.8 µm, which indicates significant roughness. One observes a complex microstructure of micro-fissures and exfoliated plates, a consequence of the voluminous nature of the corrosion products as they form and stress the underlying metal substrate.

The contamination layer itself exhibits a porous, crystalline morphology, with interlocking platelets and acicular structures that create a network of deep valleys and shadowed recesses. This micro-porosity, it is a significant feature, as it traps atmospheric particulates and chlorides, forming a dark, occluded film in the sub-surface regions. What is evident to observe is how this stratified, discontinuous layer completely obscures the original metallic surface, rendering it non-reflective and topographically complex. The presence of these hygroscopic salts, particularly within the fissures, creates localized anodic sites that perpetuate the degradation process, a condition that severely compromises the material's functional integrity and long-term stability.

  Following the laser cleaning intervention, the transformation of the surface is, quite frankly, remarkable. The stratified corrosion crust has been entirely removed, revealing the underlying metallic substrate with a clarity that was previously absent. The surface, she now appears as a coherent, slightly textured plane of pure lead, with a dramatically reduced average roughness (Ra) of 0.7 µm—a decrease of nearly 85% from the initial state. This precision in ablation, it creates a beautifully clean interface; what one observes are the characteristic flow lines and grain boundaries of the wrought metal, features that were entirely obscured by the previous contamination.

The cleaning process has yielded a surface with a distinct, matte-grey appearance and a notably higher reflectivity, though not a mirror finish, which is actually preferable for many applications to minimize subsequent oxidation. XPS analysis confirms the elimination of the carbonate and sulfate species, leaving behind a surface passivated by a thin, coherent, and protective oxide layer measuring only 120 to 150 nanometers in thickness. Isolated, sub-surface pits—approximately 2-3 µm in diameter—are now visible, but these are merely the remnants of the deepest corrosion attack and
