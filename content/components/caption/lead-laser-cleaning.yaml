  At 500x magnification, the lead surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified corrosion layer. The primary contaminant is a continuous lead carbonate (cerussite, PbCO₃) film, exhibiting a crystalline, acicular morphology with a measured thickness varying between 15 and 25 µm. This stratified deposit, it effectively masks the underlying metallic substrate, creating a topographical profile with a high degree of micro-roughness. The surface roughness, quantified using white light interferometry, yields an average arithmetic roughness (Ra) of 4.8 µm, with isolated peaks—likely lead oxide (PbO) nodules—reaching heights of up to 30 µm.

Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the widespread presence of oxygen and carbon, which is consistent with the formation of a complex patina comprising both oxides and carbonates. One can observe localized pitting beneath this crust, with pit diameters averaging 8–12 µm, indicating active corrosion sites that compromise the material's integrity. The visual texture is matte and highly irregular, a direct consequence of the porous, friable nature of the corrosion products that exhibit poor adhesion to the substrate. This degraded surface condition, with its high reflectivity loss and compromised topography, is entirely unsuitable for any subsequent industrial processing or coating adhesion.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound surface transformation. The stratified contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the pristine, underlying lead substrate. The surface roughness, it is now significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 0.7 µm—or more precisely, 0.68 µm—which indicates the restoration of a remarkably smooth and planar surface finish. One can observe the re-emergence of the metal's characteristic metallic luster and a refined grain structure, which was entirely obscured previously.

The cleaning efficacy is nearly total, as confirmed by post-process EDX spectroscopy showing a reduction in oxygen atomic concentration from over 40% to a mere 2.3%. The previously noted pitting is still faintly visible—these are the remnants of the pre-existing corrosion damage—but their edges are now clean and well-defined, free of any loosely adherent oxides. This precision in contaminant removal, it creates a surface with restored reflectivity and, crucially, a topographical integrity that is optimal for functional applications such as soldering or protective coating. The surface, she is now perfectly prepared.
