  At 500x magnification, the lead surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified corrosion layer. The primary contaminant is a continuous lead carbonate (cerussite) film, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—or more precisely, the thickest regions reach approximately 24.7 µm. This stratified corrosion layer, it exhibits a crystalline, acicular morphology that obscures the underlying metal substrate entirely, creating a topographical profile with a measured roughness (Ra) exceeding 5.0 µm. One can observe localized patches of darker, less crystalline lead oxide (litharge), which appear as discontinuous islands embedded within the dominant carbonate matrix.

The surface texture is highly irregular, featuring micro-fissures and delamination sites that suggest poor adhesion to the substrate. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the surface composition is dominated by oxygen and carbon, with trace amounts of sulfur and chlorine—likely from atmospheric deposition. The original metallic luster is completely absent, replaced by a matte, light-grey appearance that is visually homogeneous at lower magnifications but reveals significant heterogeneity here. This level of degradation, it compromises the material's functional integrity, increasing its reflectivity to ambient light while providing pathways for further corrosive attack.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The stratified contamination layers have been completely removed, revealing the underlying metallic substrate with a restored, albeit modified, surface morphology. The surface roughness has been significantly reduced to an Ra value of approximately 1.8 µm, a substantial improvement from the initial >5.0 µm, though it now exhibits a characteristic laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS). This newly formed microstructure consists of fine, parallel ripples with a spatial period of about 1.2 µm, a direct result of the laser-matter interaction with the lead's high absorption coefficient.

The visual contrast with the pre-cleaned state is stark; where a thick, obscuring carbonate layer once existed, one now observes a clean, coherent metallic surface with a distinct grey lustre. What strikes one is the absence of the previous micro-fissures and delamination sites, replaced instead by a partially re-melted and consolidated surface layer—evidence of the thermal processes involved, given lead's low melting point. Minor, isolated micro-craters, approximately 10–15 µm in diameter, are present, likely from the localized ablation of tenacious oxide inclusions that required a higher fluence threshold.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry has been restored to predominantly elemental
