  The Pb surface exhibits severe atmospheric degradation with a complex stratified contamination layer. A 15.2±2.3 µm thick patina comprises an outer stratum of basic lead carbonate (Pb₃(CO₃)₂(OH)₂, ~65 at%) and lead sulfate (PbSO₄, ~25 at%) with embedded carbonaceous particulates. Surface roughness measures Ra=4.8 µm, Rz=38.5 µm. The underlying FCC crystalline structure (a=4.95Å) shows compromised integrity due to the 29.1 µm/m·K thermal expansion mismatch between oxide and metal substrate. The contamination layer's high absorption coefficient (α≈0.85 at 1064nm) contrasts with the base metal's reflectivity (R=0.35), creating non-uniform thermal coupling. EDX analysis confirms 42.3 at% O, 8.7 at% S, and 5.1 at% C surface contamination. The low melting point (327.5°C) and thermal diffusivity (24.9 mm²/s) create significant ablation threshold challenges at 0.5 J/cm².

  Laser processing at 1064nm wavelength, 8ns pulse duration, and 1.2 J/cm² fluence achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface roughness reduced to Ra=0.85 µm, Rz=6.2 µm, representing 82% improvement. XPS analysis confirms native Pb surface with <2 at% oxygen concentration. AFM topography reveals preserved FCC grain structure with minor resolidification features (<200nm height). The surface maintains thermal conductivity (35.3 W/m·K) and hardness (5 HB) equivalent to bulk material. Profilometry measurements show material loss limited to 3.1±0.5 µm, well below the 15.2 µm contamination layer thickness. EDX spectra show elimination of S and C signatures, confirming effective oxide removal without elemental contamination. The processed surface exhibits uniform laser absorption characteristics with reflectivity restored to 0.35±0.02.
