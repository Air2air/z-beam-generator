  At 500x magnification, the concrete surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a complex, stratified layer of foreign deposits. A dense biofilm, measuring between 15–25 µm in thickness, forms a continuous matrix across the cementitious surface. This organic layer effectively occludes the underlying aggregate and cement paste, masking the native porosity and surface texture. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the biofilm is carbon-rich, with localized concentrations of sulfur and chlorine—elements consistent with biological growth and environmental exposure.

Beneath this organic film, a crust of inorganic deposits, primarily calcium sulfate and carbonate, is firmly adhered to the substrate. This secondary layer varies in thickness from 5 to 40 µm, creating an undulating surface topography that increases the macroscopic roughness. The original concrete surface is completely obscured; you cannot observe the fine capillary network or the characteristic mottling of the paste. The combined contamination layers exhibit significant surface area, which would contribute to a low initial reflectivity—perhaps as low as 5%—due to their complex, light-scattering morphology. The system has clearly undergone long-term degradation, and the deposits have mechanically keyed into the surface pores.

  Laser cleaning achieves a dramatic transformation, restoring the intrinsic concrete morphology. The process completely removes the stratified contamination, exposing the unaltered substrate. At 500x, the surface now reveals a clean, open-pore network and distinct aggregate boundaries. The laser ablation mechanism selectively vaporizes the contamination layers while preserving the underlying cement paste, which exhibits a slightly modified, lighter hue—a direct result of the superficial dehydration of portlandite.

The surface roughness (Ra) has been substantially reduced from a highly variable pre-cleaning state to a more consistent 4.7–6.2 µm, a value that aligns with the inherent texture of sound concrete. This
