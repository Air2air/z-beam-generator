  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the concrete masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The concrete exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The concrete substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal input.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
