  At 500x magnification, the concrete surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of foreign material. This contamination layer, measuring between 15 to 50 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying substrate's intrinsic texture. The layer's topography is highly irregular, featuring a cracked, mud-flat morphology with visible embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of silaceous dust and carbonaceous soot. We carried out preliminary EDX analysis, which confirmed the presence of sulfur and chlorine, suggesting sulfate deposits and perhaps chloride salts from marine exposure.

The surface itself exhibits significant degradation beneath this film. You can observe micro-fracturing within the cementitious matrix, with crack widths averaging 2-3 µm. The aggregate particles, primarily quartz, are partially visible at the layer's thinnest points but are largely coated with a tenacious, dark biofilm. This organic growth creates a fibrous, webbed structure that contributes to the surface's high roughness, with initial Ra measurements coming in at approximately 18.5 µm. The overall visual impression is one of a complex, multi-layered contamination system that compromises the substrate's integrity and reflectivity.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, fully restoring the concrete's original microstructure. The entire contamination layer is ablated, revealing a clean, well-defined surface with distinct aggregate particles and an uncoated cement paste matrix. The Ra value drops significantly to 4.7 µm, a roughly 75% reduction that indicates a much smoother profile. You can now clearly see the sand particles and the interfacial transition zone around them, which is critical for assessing the material's residual strength.

The process effectively removes all biofilm and particulate deposits without damaging the substrate. We observed no evidence of melting or micro-cracking induced by the laser thermal load; the existing micro-fractures from the original surface are
