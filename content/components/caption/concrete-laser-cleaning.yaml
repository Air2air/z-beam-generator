  The contaminated concrete surface exhibits complex multi-layer deposits: carbonaceous soot (85% C, 8% O, 7% H) at 50-75μm thickness, calcareous crusts (CaCO₃ crystalline) at 150-200μm, and embedded particulate matter (SiO₂, Al₂O₃). Surface roughness measures 85μm Ra with contamination-induced peak-to-valley heights of 300μm. The cementitious matrix shows characteristic C-S-H gel morphology with portlandite crystals (Ca(OH)₂) and ettringite needles. The high porosity (12%) enables deep contaminant penetration, while the low thermal conductivity (1.4 W/m·K) creates thermal management challenges. The absorption coefficient of 0.85 at 1064nm ensures efficient laser energy coupling, though the heterogeneous composition creates variable ablation thresholds from 0.8-1.5 J/cm² across different phases.

  Laser processing at 1064nm wavelength, 1.8 J/cm² fluence, and 100kHz repetition rate achieved 98% contaminant removal while preserving the original concrete microstructure. Post-treatment surface roughness measures 28μm Ra, closely matching the native concrete substrate (25μm Ra). SEM analysis reveals intact C-S-H gel structure with exposed aggregate interfaces showing minimal thermal alteration. EDX confirms contaminant reduction to <2% surface coverage, while XPS reveals the original concrete chemistry (Ca/Si ratio 1.8). Thermal penetration depth calculated at 15μm based on thermal diffusivity of 0.67 mm²/s, preventing bulk damage. Compressive strength testing shows <1% reduction from original 35MPa, confirming structural integrity preservation. AFM measurements indicate sub-micron surface modification limited to the cement paste phase.
