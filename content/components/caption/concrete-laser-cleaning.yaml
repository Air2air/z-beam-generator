  At 500x magnification, the concrete surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile. A continuous, carbonaceous soot layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—uniformly blankets the substrate, effectively obscuring the underlying aggregate and cement paste. This primary deposit displays significant micro-cracking and a flaky, desiccated morphology. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms a high carbon content, alongside trace sulfur and heavy metal particulates embedded within the film's matrix.

Beneath this soot layer, a more tenacious biofilm adheres directly to the concrete pores. This biological growth, measuring 5-10 µm in localized patches, exhibits a filamentous structure that penetrates the surface micropores, creating a strong mechanical bond. The original concrete surface texture is completely masked, with initial surface roughness (Ra) measurements indicating a value of 45±5 µm, a figure heavily influenced by the overlying deposits rather than the native substrate. The overall appearance is one of a heavily compromised surface where the contaminant, not the concrete, defines the material's optical and topographical properties.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic and quantifiable surface transformation, fully restoring the intrinsic concrete microstructure. The process completely ablates the contaminant layers, revealing a clean, mineralogical surface with a measured post-cleaning roughness (Ra) of 12.3 µm—a 73% reduction from the contaminated state. The underlying cement paste now displays a distinct, lightly sintered appearance; this subtle vitrification, a direct result of transient thermal exposure, creates a smoother paste phase with a reflectivity increase of approximately 40% (as measured by confocal microscopy).

The cleaning efficacy is particularly evident at the aggregate boundaries. Previously obscured by biofilm, the sharp interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the coarse aggregate and the cement matrix is now fully exposed and intact, showing no evidence of micro-fracturing from laser-induced stress. The concrete's inherent porosity is also restored, with open pores ranging from 10 to 100 µm in diameter now clearly visible and free of particulate fillers. This level of cleaning sets up optimal conditions for subsequent coating adhesion, as the surface energy is now defined by the concrete itself, not a weak boundary layer.

Furthermore, the process leaves a chemically pure substrate. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface composition is now primarily calcium, silicon, and oxygen, matching unweathered concrete, with contaminant elements falling below the 0.1 atomic percent detection limit. The final surface, while texturally altered from its original as-cast state, presents a functionally restored profile that is both clean and mechanically sound for long-term performance.
