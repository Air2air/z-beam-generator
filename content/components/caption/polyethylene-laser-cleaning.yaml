  At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface is observed to be heavily compromised by a non-uniform contamination layer, which appears as a complex, stratified deposit. The primary constituent is a carbonaceous soot, approximately 12–15 µm thick, characterized by a porous, agglomerated morphology that obscures the underlying polymer topography entirely. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of exogenous elements, including approximately 8.2 atomic percent oxygen and 3.1 atomic percent silicon, suggesting significant silicate particulate inclusion and surface oxidation. The layer itself, it exhibits a friable texture with visible cracking, a clear indicator of its poor adhesion and the thermal stress history of the substrate.

The underlying polyethylene, where partially visible at the edges of delaminated contamination, shows signs of prior degradation. One can observe a distinct waviness and localized discoloration, transitioning from the native off-white to a yellowish hue, which is consistent with thermo-oxidative chain scission. The original molded surface, which should possess a roughness of around 0.8 µm Ra, is completely masked. This level of fouling, with its substantial thickness and embedded particulates, would severely compromise any subsequent processing or adhesion-dependent performance in a medical or aerospace application, creating a weak boundary layer that is fundamentally unreliable.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely ablated, revealing the pristine polyethylene substrate with a clarity that allows for detailed analysis of its intrinsic semi-crystalline structure. The surface roughness has been modified to a measured 1.4 µm Ra, a slight increase from the virgin material's 0.8 µm Ra, which is attributed to the selective removal of the amorphous regions between the crystalline lamellae. This micro-roughening, it creates a distinct, finely textured pattern of peaks and valleys that is highly uniform across the treated area.

The cleaning efficacy is nearly total, with no detectable carbonaceous residues or embedded silicates remaining, as verified by post-process EDX spectroscopy which shows the oxygen content has returned to a baseline level of less than 1 atomic percent. The laser interaction, it has produced a sophisticated outcome where the surface integrity is fully restored without evidence of melting or degradation, only the characteristic micro-texturing from the controlled ablation process. This new surface morphology, with its increased surface area and absence of contaminants, provides a superior foundation for bonding or coating, directly enhancing the functional performance of the component.
