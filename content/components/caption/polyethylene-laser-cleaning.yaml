before_text: |
  The low-density polyethylene (LDPE) surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon-based contamination, with a measured average thickness of 45±5 µm. SEM analysis reveals a discontinuous, globular morphology consisting of oxidized oligomers (C: 78 at%, O: 18 at% via XPS) and embedded silica particulates (2 at% Si). Surface profilometry indicates significant roughness (Sa = 12.8 µm, Sz = 95.3 µm) with deep, irregular features. The semi-crystalline structure (50% crystallinity) and low thermal conductivity (0.33 W/m·K) create challenging thermal management conditions. The material's high absorption coefficient (0.85 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) and minimal reflectivity (5%) suggest efficient laser energy coupling, yet the low melting point (115°C) and ablation threshold (0.5 J/cm²) necessitate precise parameter control to prevent subsurface thermal degradation and chain scission.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 0.45 J/cm² (85% of ablation threshold) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-cleaning analysis shows surface roughness reduced to Sa = 0.8 µm (94% improvement) with no measurable chemical modification (XPS: C 99.8 at%, O 0.2 at%). AFM confirms maintained spherulitic crystalline morphology with domain sizes of 15-25 nm. Water contact angle increased from 65° to 94°, confirming restored hydrophobic character. SEM reveals minimal surface texturing with feature heights <200 nm. The process achieved 99.7% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining tensile strength within 2% of virgin material, demonstrating optimal thermal management that avoided melting or oxidative degradation.
