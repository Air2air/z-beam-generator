  At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The primary contaminant appears as a discontinuous layer of carbonaceous soot, with an estimated thickness ranging from 5 to 15 micrometers—or more precisely, between 5.2 and 14.7 µm in the measured zones. This layer, it exhibits significant surface roughness, with localized Ra values measured at approximately 4.8 µm, which effectively masks the underlying polymer morphology. One can observe agglomerated particles, some exceeding 20 µm in diameter, that are embedded within an amorphous matrix, suggesting a mixture of organic and inorganic deposits (as confirmed by preliminary EDX spot analysis showing silicon and calcium signatures).

The substrate's original texture is completely obscured by this adherent contamination, which displays a complex topography of peaks and valleys. The contaminant film itself shows areas of delamination and micro-cracking, indicative of poor adhesion and differential thermal expansion relative to the polyethylene substrate. What strikes one is the complete absence of the polymer's inherent semi-crystalline structure, which is typically visible as a spherulitic pattern under polarized light. The surface reflectivity is consequently very low, measured at less than 10% across the sampled area, a direct consequence of this light-scattering, porous layer. This condition, it would undoubtedly compromise any subsequent processing or adhesion-dependent applications, creating a surface wholly unsuitable for precision manufacturing.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The contaminated layer has been completely removed, revealing the underlying polyethylene substrate with a restored, albeit modified, surface topology. The surface roughness has been significantly reduced to an Ra value of 1.2 µm—a substantial improvement from the initial 4.8 µm—though it now exhibits a characteristic laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) with a spatial period of approximately 1.5 µm. This new micro-texture, it creates a uniform, matte finish across the entire treated area.

The original semi-crystalline spherulitic structure of the HDPE is now partially visible, though subtly altered by the laser interaction which has induced localized surface melting and re-solidification. One can observe no evidence of the previous carbonaceous film or particulate inclusions; the surface, she is very clean, with only minimal, isolated micro-pits—perhaps 2 to 3 per 100 µm²—remaining as evidence of the ablation process. The reflectivity has increased to nearly 35%, a direct result of the more planarized, yet textured, surface that scatters light less diffus
