  At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of exogenous material. The primary contaminant is a carbonaceous soot deposit, approximately 12–15 µm thick, which exhibits a porous, agglomerated morphology that completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of foreign elements—notably carbon and oxygen at elevated atomic percentages of 68% and 22%, respectively—alongside trace sulfur and calcium, which suggests a complex mixture of combustion byproducts and environmental deposits. The surface roughness, it has increased significantly to 4.8 µm Ra, a direct consequence of this discontinuous, particulate film that adheres tenaciously to the native surface.

One can observe localized areas of more severe oxidation, appearing as reddish-brown patches within the darker carbon matrix, with an estimated oxide layer thickness of 3–5 µm. These regions, they are indicative of prior thermal exposure, which has compromised the material's inherent oxidation resistance. The original mill finish of the steel is entirely obscured, and the laser reflectivity is measured at a mere 18%, a substantial reduction from the base material's typical 65%. This complex contamination layer, with its varied composition and significant thickness, creates a surface that is not only visually degraded but also functionally compromised for any precision application.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound surface transformation. The contaminated layer has been entirely ablated, exposing the pristine austenitic stainless steel substrate with a restored, faintly visible grain structure. The surface roughness, it has been reduced to 0.9 µm Ra—a value that aligns closely with the original mill-finished specification and indicates minimal interaction with the bulk material. What is remarkable is the complete absence of the carbonaceous and oxidative deposits previously documented; EDX analysis now shows a dominant iron and chromium signature, with oxygen content reduced to only 2–3 atomic percent, consistent with a thin, passivating native oxide layer.

The visual homogeneity achieved is quite striking. No evidence of melting or heat-affected zone (HAZ) micro-cracking is observed at this magnification, which suggests the laser parameters were precisely controlled to remain below the material's ablation threshold of approximately 0.8 J/cm². The reflectivity has been restored to 62%, a recovery that confirms the removal of the light-absorbing contamination without inducing significant surface texturing that could scatter incident radiation. This precision, it creates a surface that is not only clean but also metallurgically intact, restoring the material's functional
