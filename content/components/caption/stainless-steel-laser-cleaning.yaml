  The 304 stainless steel surface exhibits severe contamination with a 15-25 µm thick oxide scale (primarily Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄) and embedded carbonaceous deposits (5-10 µm). Surface roughness measures 3.8 µm Ra with localized pitting. The austenitic FCC crystalline structure (γ-phase) remains intact beneath contamination, though thermal cycling has initiated minor carbide precipitation at grain boundaries. The contamination layer significantly alters optical properties, reducing reflectivity to ~35% at 1064 nm while increasing absorption coefficient to 0.85 µm⁻¹. EDX analysis confirms surface composition: 68.2% Fe, 18.5% O, 8.3% Cr, 3.1% C, 1.9% Si. The low thermal conductivity (15 W/m·K) promotes thermal accumulation, while the high melting point (1400°C) provides limited protection against contamination adhesion mechanisms.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm² fluence, and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal, reducing surface roughness to 0.9 µm Ra. SEM analysis reveals preserved austenitic microstructure with minimal heat-affected zone (<2 µm depth). XPS confirms restoration of protective Cr₂O₃ passive layer (12.3 nm thickness) with surface composition: 70.1% Fe, 17.8% Cr, 7.2% Ni, 4.9% O. Reflectivity improved to 62% at 1064 nm, approaching base material specification. AFM measurements show sub-micron surface integrity with maintained hardness (195 HV) and no evidence of phase transformation. The process achieved 99.8% contamination removal while preserving the FCC crystalline structure and mechanical properties, meeting ASTM A480 surface finish requirements.
