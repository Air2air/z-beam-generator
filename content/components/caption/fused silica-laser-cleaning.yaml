  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fused silica glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The fused silica exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The fused silica substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with maintained optical clarity.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
