  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the fused silica glass substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The fused silica exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from atmospheric deposition and processing residues.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 98.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The fused silica substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal shock.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
