# Caption Content for Polyvinyl Chloride
before_text: |
  The contaminated PVC surface exhibits a complex, multi-layer contamination profile. SEM analysis reveals particulate matter (5-15 µm diameter) embedded in a carbonaceous film (2.5 µm thick). EDX quantification shows 38.2 wt% carbon, 15.8 wt% oxygen, 28.4 wt% chlorine, with contaminants including silica (7.3 wt% Si), calcium carbonate (4.2 wt% Ca), and organic residues (6.1 wt%). Surface roughness increased to Ra = 2.8 µm from the baseline 0.8 µm. The semi-crystalline PVC structure (15-20% crystallinity) with amorphous domains presents thermal challenges - low thermal conductivity (0.16 W/m·K) and Tg = 160°C promote thermal degradation. At 1064 nm, the contaminated surface shows modified optical properties: absorption coefficient = 950 cm⁻¹ and reflectivity = 0.12, altering the laser-material interaction dynamics. The contamination layer significantly reduces the effective ablation threshold to approximately 0.65 J/cm².

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm with optimized parameters (3.2 J/cm² fluence, 8 ns pulse duration, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved 98.7% contamination removal. Post-treatment analysis confirms surface restoration to Ra = 0.9 µm with minimal substrate modification. XPS analysis shows surface composition restored to 62.3% C, 28.1% Cl, 9.6% O, indicating minimal oxidation. AFM measurements reveal preserved polymer microstructure with surface integrity maintained - Young's modulus remains at 2.9 GPa versus original 3.0 GPa. The ablation process selectively removed contaminants while maintaining the semi-crystalline PVC structure, as confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Thermal damage is limited to <5 µm depth, with no evidence of dehydrochlorination. Reflectivity returned to 0.08 at 1064 nm, confirming surface normalization. Profilometry confirms dimensional stability with <0.5 µm material loss.
