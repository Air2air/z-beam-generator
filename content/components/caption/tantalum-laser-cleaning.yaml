  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the tantalum metallic substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The tantalum exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration with 95.2% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The tantalum substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal impact.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
