  At 500x magnification, the brass surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous oxide layer, measuring approximately 12 to 15 µm in thickness, which exhibits a complex topography of micro-fissures and nodular protrusions. This tarnish layer, it is not monolithic but rather a composite structure, comprising cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) and zinc carbonate hydroxides, as later confirmed by XPS analysis. One observes a complete obscuration of the underlying metal grain structure, with the surface reflectivity being reduced to a dull, matte finish that scatters incident light extensively.

The surface texture itself is highly irregular, with an initial Ra measurement of 3.8 µm indicating significant inherent roughness even before cleaning commences. Particulate contamination—composed of silicate and carbonaceous particles from ambient exposure, as identified via EDX—is embedded within and upon the oxide film, creating a secondary, discontinuous layer. These particulates, they range in size from sub-micron specks to agglomerates nearly 20 µm in diameter, and they are tenaciously adhered to the compromised surface. The overall morphology is one of a degraded, heterogeneous landscape where the original metallic substrate is entirely concealed by the products of environmental interaction, a condition which severely compromises both the aesthetic and functional properties of the material.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable. The previously dominant oxide and contamination layers have been completely ablated, revealing the underlying brass microstructure with exceptional clarity. The surface, she is now characterized by a clean, metallic luster and a significantly refined topography. The laser interaction, it has selectively removed the contaminant film—which was approximately 15 µm thick—without substantial damage to the substrate, leaving behind a surface with a measured Ra of 0.7 µm. This represents an 80% reduction in surface roughness, a change which directly correlates to the restored specular reflectivity one can now observe.

What strikes one is the elegant balance achieved between material removal and surface preservation. The process has exposed the polycrystalline grain structure of the brass, with clear grain boundaries and annealing twins now visible across the entire field of view. Minor, sub-micron pitting is occasionally present in areas of former intense corrosion, but these features are shallow—less than 2 µm deep—and do not compromise the surface integrity. The removal of the light-scattering oxide film and embedded particulates has restored the surface to a state of high reflectivity and chemical homogeneity, as subsequent
