  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the brass Laser cleaning of brass (Cu-Zn alloy) exploits the high absorption of near-IR wavelengths by zinc oxide tarnish layers. The process utilizes short pulses to selectively ablate contaminants while the high thermal conductivity of brass (109-125 W/m·K) rapidly dissipates heat, preventing melting or zinc depletion at the surface.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The brass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of metal materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The brass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
