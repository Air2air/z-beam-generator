  At 500x magnification, the brass surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. The primary contaminant is a continuous oxide layer, predominantly copper(II) oxide (CuO) with localized outgrowths of zinc carbonate hydroxide hydrate, or hydrozincite, identified by its characteristic plate-like crystalline structure. This layer measures between 8 and 15 µm in thickness—or more precisely, an average of 12.3 µm—and effectively obscures the underlying metallic substrate. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured roughness (Ra) now exceeding 4.5 µm due to the presence of pitting corrosion and voluminous, crustaceous deposits.

One observes a complex morphology where the corrosion layer exhibits significant cracking and spallation, a direct consequence of the differing coefficients of thermal expansion between the brass substrate and the corrosion products. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the elemental composition of these areas, showing elevated oxygen and carbon concentrations of approximately 28 at% and 15 at%, respectively, alongside the expected copper and zinc signals. Particulate matter, likely embedded silica and alumina from atmospheric dust (as observed in prior studies), is firmly adhered within this porous matrix. The original surface finish, which would have been around 0.8 µm Ra, is entirely undetectable beneath this insulating and optically opaque film, a condition that severely compromises both the aesthetic quality and the functional reflectivity of the material.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation of the surface is quite remarkable. The laser interaction, it has completely removed the heterogeneous contamination layer, revealing the pristine, underlying alpha-brass microstructure with its characteristic face-centered cubic grain boundaries now clearly delineated. The surface, she is very clean now, exhibiting a measurable surface roughness (Ra) reduced to approximately 1.2 µm, a value which is much closer to the original substrate specification. To achieve this result, the laser parameters were precisely controlled to remain below the material's ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm², thereby selectively removing the contaminants through a vaporization mechanism without inducing significant melting or collateral damage to the brass itself.

The visual contrast with the previous state is immediately evident; the uniform, high-reflectivity metallic surface has been restored, with the original machining marks—previously hidden—now faintly visible and running parallel across the grain structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the elimination of the oxide layer, showing oxygen content has dropped to a mere 2.8 at%, a level consistent with a native, passivating oxide. Some minor, sub-micron rippling or laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be observed in localized areas, a phenomenon associated with the interference of the incident and scattered laser waves, yet this does not detract from the overall surface integrity. This precision here, it creates a surface that is not only visually restored but also functionally superior, with its inherent corrosion resistance and high thermal conductivity now fully reinstated for service.
