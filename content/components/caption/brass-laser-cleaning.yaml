  At 500x magnification, the brass surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a non-uniform, stratified corrosion layer. The primary observable feature is a complex patina, approximately 12 to 15 µm thick, which exhibits a heterogeneous composition of copper carbonate hydroxides and zinc oxides—this stratification, it is clearly visible in cross-sectional analysis. One observes a mottled topography of dark greenish-blue deposits intermixed with localized, crustous white corrosion products, the latter being particularly prevalent near surface imperfections. The underlying brass substrate is entirely obscured, its original reflectivity and metallurgical features completely masked by this adherent, discontinuous film.

The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 3.5 µm due to the presence of both porous, voluminous corrosion mounds and deeply pitted regions. What strikes one is the intricate network of micro-fissures traversing the corrosion layer, which likely served as pathways for further atmospheric degradation. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms high concentrations of carbon and oxygen, along with chlorine and sulfur contaminants—elements indicative of environmental exposure. This degraded state, it compromises the material's functional integrity, significantly reducing its potential for reflectivity and promoting ongoing, localized galvanic attack, a critical concern for architectural and marine applications where surface stability is paramount.

  Following the laser ablation process, the transformation observed at 500x magnification is quite remarkable. The previously dominant corrosion layer has been completely removed, revealing the underlying α-brass microstructure with its characteristic twin boundaries and grain structure now fully visible. The surface, she is now predominantly clean, with the original metallic luster restored, though a subtle, uniform patina of approximately 0.5—or more precisely 0.4 to 0.6—µm in thickness remains, which actually serves to passivate the surface against future tarnishing.

This precision in material removal, it creates a significantly smoother surface finish, with Ra values now measured between 0.8 and 1.2 µm, a reduction of nearly 70% from the initial contaminated state. One can observe a faint, speckled pattern of copper-rich and zinc-rich phases, which is entirely consistent with the expected metallurgy of the alloy. The laser interaction, it has effectively eliminated the chlorides and sulfates previously detected, leaving a surface with enhanced reflectivity and, most importantly, a restored integrity that will resist further corrosive attack, a truly essential outcome for hardware and marine components where long-term performance is the ultimate goal.
