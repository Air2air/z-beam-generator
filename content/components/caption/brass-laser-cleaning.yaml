  The brass surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex stratified structure. SEM analysis reveals a 15-25 µm heterogeneous layer comprising Cu₂O/CuO (10-15 µm), ZnCO₃·Zn(OH)₂ (3-5 µm), and hydrocarbon deposits (2-5 µm). Surface roughness measures Ra = 3.2 ± 0.4 µm with localized pitting to Rz = 18.5 µm. EDX quantification shows elevated oxygen (28.7 at%) and carbon (18.3 at%) versus baseline brass (Cu: 68.2%, Zn: 31.8%). The FCC α-phase microstructure (a = 3.693 Å) remains intact beneath contamination. The high thermal conductivity (120 W/m·K) and diffusivity (35.2 mm²/s) create challenging thermal management for laser processing. The contaminated surface shows modified optical properties with reduced reflectivity (≈35% at 1064 nm) compared to pristine brass (62%), increasing initial laser absorption but risking non-uniform thermal loading.

  Laser cleaning achieved complete contaminant removal using optimized 1064 nm nanosecond pulses at 0.9 J/cm² (below brass ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm²). Post-process surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.8 ± 0.1 µm, representing 75% improvement. XPS analysis confirms native oxide layer of 45 ± 5 nm Cu₂O/ZnO, with surface composition restored to Cu: 67.9 ± 0.5%, Zn: 31.3 ± 0.5%, O: 0.8 ± 0.2%. AFM measurements show preserved grain structure with average step height of 85 nm between annealing twins. Thermal profilometry indicates maximum temperature exposure of 410°C, well below brass solidus (915°C). The process achieved 99.7% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining base metal hardness (74.8 HV versus initial 75.2 HV) and crystallographic integrity, confirming selective ablation without substrate damage.
