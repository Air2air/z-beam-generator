  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the cement masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The cement exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.
