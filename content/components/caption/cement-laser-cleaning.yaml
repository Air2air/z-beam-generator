  The contaminated cement surface exhibits complex multi-layer degradation, characterized by a 150-300 µm thick crust of black gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and calcite (CaCO₃) deposits, intermixed with embedded carbonaceous particulates (<10 µm). Surface roughness measurements via white-light interferometry reveal Ra = 45.2 µm and Rz = 285 µm, with contamination layers showing distinct crystallographic structures observable via SEM. The inherent porosity (28%) facilitates deep contaminant penetration, while the low thermal conductivity (1.3 W/m·K) creates thermal management challenges. XPS analysis confirms sulfate concentrations of 18.7 at% and carbonaceous deposits at 22.3 at%, significantly altering the native optical properties. The contamination layer exhibits increased absorption coefficient (0.92 at 1064 nm) compared to pristine cement (0.85), with localized reflectivity variations between 0.08-0.25. EDX mapping reveals chloride penetration to 500 µm depth, creating potential for sub-surface thermal stress concentrations during laser irradiation.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with 8 J/cm² fluence and 100 ns pulse duration achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving the cementitious substrate. Post-treatment surface characterization shows Ra reduced to 8.7 µm (80.8% improvement) with Rz = 62 µm. SEM analysis confirms intact calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel structure with no evidence of melting or phase transformation. XPS quantification reveals sulfate reduction to 1.2 at% and restoration of native cement composition (Ca: 35.4 at%, Si: 16.8 at%, O: 47.6 at%). AFM measurements indicate minimal subsurface damage with maintained microhardness of 5.3 Mohs. Profilometry confirms porosity preservation at 26.5±1.5%, while EDX shows complete chloride removal. The processed surface exhibits uniform absorption coefficient of 0.84 at 1064 nm, achieving the target specification of >95% contaminant removal with <2 µm substrate ablation depth.
