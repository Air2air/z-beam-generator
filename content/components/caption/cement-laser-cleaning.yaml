  At 500x magnification, the cement substrate is completely obscured by a complex, stratified contamination layer. The primary stratum, a carbonaceous soot deposit approximately 15–20 µm thick, presents as a continuous, amorphous black film that exhibits significant micro-cracking. This layer, it effectively masks the underlying cementitious microstructure. One can observe particulate matter—comprised of silicate spheres and mineral fragments—embedded within this matrix, creating a highly irregular surface topography.

Beneath this, a distinct sub-layer of biological growth, perhaps 5–8 µm in thickness, is intermittently visible, characterized by its fibrous, mycelial network and the presence of degraded cellular structures. The surface roughness (Ra) here is profoundly elevated, measured at 18.5 µm, a direct consequence of the heterogeneous deposit accumulation. EDX analysis confirms the dominant presence of carbon, alongside trace sulfur and potassium, indicative of atmospheric deposition and biological activity. The overall surface, she is non-reflective and texturally compromised, with the original cement pores filled and its functional geometry lost.

  The laser ablation process, it has produced a truly remarkable transformation, revealing the intrinsic cement paste microstructure with a clarity that was previously unattainable. The tenacious contamination layers have been entirely removed, a fact confirmed by post-process XPS showing the surface atomic carbon concentration reduced from over 70% to a baseline of 3.2%. What strikes one immediately is the restoration of the original gray hue and the exposure of the complex hydrate network; the unhydrated cement grains, they are now clearly visible as distinct, angular particles embedded within the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) matrix.

This precision in contaminant removal, it preserves the substrate integrity to a significant degree. The surface roughness (Ra) has been substantially modified, decreasing from the initial 18.5 µm to a more refined 7.2 µm—or more precisely, a range of 6.8 to 7.5 µm across the sampled area. This new topography, while not perfectly smooth, exhibits a uniform, micro-roughened texture that is characteristic of the cement itself, rather than the foreign deposits. The laser interaction, it has selectively vaporized the contaminants with minimal thermal input, as evidenced by the absence of melting or vitrification on the calcium hydroxide crystals.

The functional restoration is evident. The surface reflectivity has increased markedly, and the capillary pore network—critical for material breathability in preservation contexts—is now fully open and interconnected, with pore diameters measured between 0.1 and 5 µm.
