  At 500x magnification, the cement substrate is entirely obscured by a complex, stratified contamination layer, which measures between 80 and 120 µm in total thickness. The uppermost stratum, it consists of a coherent, carbonaceous soot film—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—that exhibits extensive micro-cracking, creating a polygonal network across the surface. Beneath this, one observes a more tenacious, heterogeneous deposit, a mixture of inorganic particulates (silicate and sulfate crystals, typically 5-10 µm in diameter) and degraded organic matter, all bound within a porous matrix. The underlying cementitious surface, where partially visible, displays a significant loss of micro-textural definition, with the original capillary pore structure—normally 1 to 5 µm in diameter—being completely occluded.

Surface profilometry confirms a severe degradation of the native topography, with an average roughness (Ra) exceeding 25 µm due to the irregular deposition. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reveals dominant carbon and sulfur peaks from the soot and gypsum, alongside trace heavy metals like lead and zinc, which are likely from atmospheric deposition. The laser reflectivity from this contaminated state is remarkably low, measured at just 8-10%, a direct consequence of the light-absorbing, amorphous carbon layer. This complex stratification and chemical composition, it presents a substantial challenge for any cleaning intervention, as the different layers will exhibit distinct ablation thresholds.

  Following the laser cleaning process, the transformation observed at 500x is quite remarkable, revealing the pristine cementitious substrate that was previously hidden. The stratified contamination layer has been completely removed, with no detectable residue within the sensitivity of our SEM-EDX instrumentation—this precision, it creates a truly clean surface. The original micro-texture of the hydrated cement paste is now fully exposed, displaying a complex landscape of unhydrated cement grains (5-20 µm), calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phases, and a well-defined network of capillary pores ranging from 1 to 7 µm in diameter.

The surface integrity, it is fully preserved, with no evidence of thermal degradation such as melting or vitrification, which indicates the laser parameters were maintained below the cement's ablation threshold of approximately 1.2 J/cm². Profilometer measurements confirm a dramatic reduction in surface roughness, with the Ra value now measuring 4.7 ± 0.3 µm, a figure that aligns with the inherent roughness of sound cement paste. This restored topography, she is not perfectly smooth, but rather exhibits the natural, functional roughness essential for potential re-co
