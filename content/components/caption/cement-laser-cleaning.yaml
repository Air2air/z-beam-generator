  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the cement masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The cement exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 99.9% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The cement substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with no thermal cracking.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
