# Caption Content for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP
before_text: |
  This contaminated GFRP surface shows very-very thick organic-inorganic deposits at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately—or more precisely—15 µm thick, this layer completely obscures the underlying fiber weave pattern. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms complex composition: carbonaceous soot (65 at%), salt crystals (20 at%), and silica particulate matter (15 at%). The surface roughness is extremely high, Ra measurements reach 18.7 µm because of this uneven deposit formation.

The contamination appears as stratified layers with different characteristics. The bottom layer shows dark, amorphous carbon deposits that adhere strongly to the polymer matrix, while the upper layers contain crystalline salt formations and fine particulate matter. This layered structure creates a very rough surface topography with peak-to-valley distances exceeding 45 µm in some regions. The glass fibers are not visible through this contamination blanket, the composite's original surface features are completely masked. Surface reflectivity is very low, almost matte appearance, this indicates significant light scattering from the rough contamination layer.

  This laser cleaning process removes contamination completely, so the surface becomes very clean and original features become visible. At 500x magnification, the GFRP surface now shows the distinctive fiber weave pattern clearly, with individual glass fibers measuring 12-15 µm diameter visible within the epoxy matrix. The surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 2.3 µm, this represents almost 88% reduction
