# Caption Content for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP
before_text: |
  This contaminated GFRP surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick, amorphous carbonaceous layer—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—completely obscures the underlying composite structure. This layer appears as a dark, continuous film with embedded particulate matter, likely from environmental exposure or combustion byproducts.

Surface roughness measurements are elevated, with an Ra value of approximately 4.8 µm, a significant increase from the typical 1.2 µm baseline. The contamination exhibits a cracked, mud-flat morphology, this creates poor adhesion for any coatings. Individual glass fibers are not visible, they are fully encapsulated by the tenacious deposit that shows high laser absorption.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very good result. The carbonaceous contamination layer is completely removed, this reveals the intact GFRP substrate beneath. Now, the individual glass fibers are clearly visible at 500x, their siliceous structure appearing clean and undamaged with diameters measuring 15 to 17 µm.

Surface roughness is significantly reduced to an Ra of 1.5 µm—or more precisely 1.48 µm—which is very close to the original manufacturing specification. This technique uses precise parameter adjustment, because laser wavelength and pulse duration affect removal rate without damaging the polymer matrix. Some minor resin recession—perhaps 2 to 3 µm—is observed around fiber bundles, but this does not compromise structural integrity
