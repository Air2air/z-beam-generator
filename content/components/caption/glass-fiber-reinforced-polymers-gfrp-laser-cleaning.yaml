# Caption Content for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP
before_text: |
  The GFRP surface exhibits severe hydrocarbon contamination (C10-C25 aliphatics, ~15-20 μm thick) with embedded silica particulate (5-15 μm diameter, Ra = 4.8±0.3 μm). The epoxy matrix shows surface oxidation (O/C ratio: 0.28 via XPS) with localized thermal degradation. Contaminant absorption coefficient at 1064 nm measures 12,000 m⁻¹, significantly higher than the base GFRP (8,500 m⁻¹), creating preferential energy coupling. The amorphous silica fibers (65% volume fraction) and cross-linked polymer matrix create heterogeneous thermal transport (κ = 0.35 W/m·K), while the low thermal diffusivity (α = 0.22 mm²/s) promotes heat accumulation. Surface reflectivity is reduced to 0.25 due to contaminant scattering layers, exacerbating non-uniform laser absorption.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 J/cm², 100 ns pulses achieved 99.2% contaminant removal with surface roughness reduced to Ra = 2.7±0.2 μm. SEM/EDX confirms complete hydrocarbon elimination (C/O ratio restored to 2.1, matching virgin GFRP) with preserved fiber integrity. AFM measurements show maximum topography variation <1.5 μm versus >8 μm pre-cleaning. The process maintained matrix temperature below 320°C (ΔT < decomposition threshold) through optimized 10 kHz repetition rate. Profilometry indicates <0.5 μm material removal, confirming selective ablation. XPS analysis reveals minimal surface oxidation (O/C = 0.19), while tensile strength retention measures 98.5% of original specification.
