# Caption Content for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP

  This contaminated GFRP surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick carbonaceous deposit—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—covers the entire area, this layer completely obscures the underlying composite structure. The deposit appears as a dense, amorphous film with localized cracking, its morphology suggests thermal degradation products from prior service exposure.

Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation from the baseline 1.2 µm Ra, now measuring approximately 8.5 µm Ra. This contamination layer exhibits a porous, agglomerated texture with embedded particulate matter, likely environmental dust and soot. The original fiber weave pattern is not visible, the surface presents only this uniform, matte-black coating that reduces reflectivity substantially. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content, with trace sulfur and silicon contaminants also present within this layer.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic surface transformation, very-very good result. At 500x magnification, the contaminated layer is completely removed, this reveals the intact underlying glass fiber and polymer matrix. The original light-beige color of the composite is fully restored, a clear visual indicator of successful contaminant ablation without substrate damage.

Surface analysis confirms the restoration of the original fiber weave texture. Post-cleaning roughness measurements now read 1.8 µm Ra—only a slight increase from the as-manufactured 1.2 µm Ra, this minimal change indicates excellent process control. Individual glass fibers are clearly visible, their surfaces remain smooth and undamaged, this demonstrates the laser parameters stayed well below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold for the composite. The polymer matrix between fibers shows no evidence of thermal degradation—no bubbling, charring, or discoloration that would indicate excessive thermal loading.

This method achieves complete contamination removal, so the surface becomes functionally clean. SEM examination reveals no residual deposit in the fiber-matrix interphase regions, a critical area where contaminants typically persist. The surface reflectivity increases significantly, this restoration is crucial for subsequent coating adhesion or inspection procedures. The process successfully cleared the 15-20 µm contamination layer while preserving the structural integrity of both the glass fibers and the polymer matrix, a very-very precise ablation result.
