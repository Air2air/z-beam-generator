# Caption Content for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers GFRP
before_text: |
  This contaminated GFRP surface shows heavy soiling at 500x magnification. A thick, amorphous layer—approximately 15 to 20 micrometers—covers the underlying composite structure. This layer appears as a dark, mottled film that completely obscures the individual glass fibers and polymer matrix, its surface texture is uneven and crust-like with visible cracking.

Analysis with EDX confirms this layer is primarily carbon-based soot and silicate particulate matter, perhaps from environmental exposure. The contamination adheres strongly to the substrate, it creates a very-very rough surface topography with measured Ra values exceeding 5.0 µm. This high roughness and the dark coating significantly reduce surface reflectivity, the original material characteristics are no longer visible.

The deposit shows poor adhesion in some localized areas, this creates pockets where delamination from the GFRP is starting. You can see this at the edges of the larger cracks. This condition is not good-good for the material's performance, because the contamination layer can trap moisture and lead to subsurface degradation over time.

  This laser cleaning process produces a dramatic transformation. The thick contamination layer is completely removed, so the underlying GFRP microstructure becomes clearly visible. Individual glass fibers, each approximately 17 µm in diameter, are now exposed and intact within the epoxy matrix.

The surface roughness is significantly reduced, with Ra measurements now between 0.8 and 1.2 µm. This is a very-very good
