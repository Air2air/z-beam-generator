  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp Laser cleaning of GFRP utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the glass fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix. The process operates below the ablation threshold of the composite material (typically 0.5-1.5 J/cm² for epoxy-based GFRP) to ensure non-destructive removal of coatings and contaminants.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The glass fiber reinforced polymers gfrp substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
