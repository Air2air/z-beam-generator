  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the silicon carbide Laser cleaning of Silicon Carbide utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The high thermal conductivity (490 W/m·K) and extreme hardness (Mohs 9.5) of SiC require optimized laser parameters to achieve selective removal while maintaining material integrity. This non-contact process eliminates chemical waste and enables micron-level precision for semiconductor and aerospace applications.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface. The silicon carbide exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of semiconductor materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The silicon carbide substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
