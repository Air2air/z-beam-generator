# Caption Content for Silicon Carbide

  At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface shows significant contamination. A carbonaceous deposit layer, approximately 12–15 µm thick, appears as a continuous, amorphous film. This layer, it has a mottled gray appearance with visible cracking—likely from thermal stress during prior processing. Surface roughness measurements indicate an Ra value of 3.8 µm, a substantial increase from the substrate's inherent roughness.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the layer's composition is primarily carbon (85 at%) with traces of oxygen (10 at%) and silicon (5 at%). The contamination adheres in a non-uniform pattern, creating localized mounds that reach up to 25 µm in height. These features scatter light, which would severely compromise the surface's functional reflectivity. The underlying SiC grain structure is completely obscured, indicating the coating's thickness and integrity present a major barrier to surface functionality.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation. The contaminated layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine polycrystalline SiC substrate. Surface roughness is now measured at Ra 0.4 µm—a 90% reduction from the pre-cleaned state. The characteristic hexagonal crystalline structure of the alpha-SiC is clearly visible, with grain boundaries sharply defined.

This cleaned surface, it shows minimal thermal damage. Only occasional, shallow micro-craters—approximately 5–10 µm in diameter—are observable, evidence of selective ablation at impurity sites. XPS analysis confirms surface chemistry restoration, with oxygen content reduced to a native 2.1 at% oxide layer. The restoration of surface planarity and intrinsic material composition directly correlates to regained thermal and electronic performance, critical for semiconductor applications. The process successfully restored the surface to its functional specification.
