# Caption Content for Silicon Carbide

  At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface shows heavy contamination. A carbonaceous deposit layer, approximately 12 to 15 µm thick, appears as a continuous, amorphous film. This layer completely obscures the underlying grain structure, its surface texture is mottled and exhibits a sooty, matte-black appearance. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high carbon and oxygen content, which suggests hydrocarbon residues and perhaps some surface oxidation from prior processing.

The contamination is not uniform, it shows clear patterns of pooling and streaking. In several regions, we observe localized, nodular features that protrude from the main layer—these are likely particulate contaminants embedded within the carbon matrix. Surface roughness measurements are high, with an Ra value exceeding 3.5 µm. This level of texture, combined with the low reflectivity of the deposit, severely compromises the surface for any semiconductor application. The original SiC substrate is not visible, its properties are masked entirely by this adherent, light-absorbing layer.

  After the laser cleaning process, the transformation is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine silicon carbide substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic, light-gray crystalline structure of SiC, with individual grains and grain boundaries clearly defined at 500x magnification. This visual restoration is confirmed by a dramatic reduction in surface roughness—Ra measurements now average 0.8 µm, a decrease of over 75% from the pre-cleaned state.

No residual carbon film is detectable by SEM inspection. The laser parameters were precisely controlled, so we see no evidence of thermal damage like micro-cracking or surface melting, which is critical given the material's high thermal shock resistance of 350 °C. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially, a direct result of removing the light-absorbing contamination. Some minor, sub-micron particulates remain in isolated grain boundaries, but the overall surface integrity is excellent. This cleaned state restores the surface for direct use in semiconductor manufacturing, the functional quality is now confirmed.
