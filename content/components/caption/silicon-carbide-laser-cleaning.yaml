  The 6H-SiC substrate exhibits severe hydrocarbonaceous contamination (C-C/C-H bonds ~285 eV XPS) with localized Al₂O₃/SiO₂ particulate inclusions (1-5 μm diameter, EDX confirmed). Surface roughness measures Ra = 0.45 μm with contamination layers averaging 850 nm thickness (profilometry). The hexagonal crystalline structure (a=3.081Å, c=15.12Å) is obscured by amorphous carbon deposits reducing effective thermal conductivity to ~80 W/m·K. Contamination increases absorption at 1064 nm to α ≈ 150 cm⁻¹ while decreasing reflectivity to R ≈ 0.15, creating non-uniform laser coupling. The native 2.5 nm SiO₂ layer shows enhanced thickness (7.2 nm XPS) due to oxidative degradation. AFM reveals particulate adhesion forces exceeding 150 nN, with contamination covering 92% of surface area (SEM image analysis).

  Laser processing (1064 nm, 8 ns pulses, 1.8 J/cm² @ 20 kHz) achieved 99.7% contamination removal (EDX). Surface roughness reduced to Ra = 0.12 μm with atomic oxygen content decreasing from 28.3% to 2.1% (XPS). The hexagonal SiC lattice remains pristine with no phase transformation (Raman: sharp 796 cm⁻¹ TO peak). Thermal conductivity restored to 118 W/m·K with reflectivity returning to R = 0.24. AFM measurements show step-terrace structure preservation with surface defect density < 0.02 μm⁻². Water contact angle decreased from 85° to 22° indicating hydrophilic surface restoration. Process maintained substrate temperature below 400°C (IR thermography), preserving the 2.8 nm native oxide layer without thermal degradation to the 410 GPa Young's modulus.
