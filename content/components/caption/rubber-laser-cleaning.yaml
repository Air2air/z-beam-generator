  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the rubber composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The rubber exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The rubber substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber-matrix bond.
  Microscopic examination confirms comprehensive surface decontamination while preserving substrate integrity.
