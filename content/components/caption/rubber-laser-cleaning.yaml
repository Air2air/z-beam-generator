before_text: |
  The contaminated rubber surface exhibits complex multi-layer contamination with 15-25 µm thick deposits. SEM-EDX analysis identifies primary contaminants as silica particulate (SiO₂, 5-8 µm diameter, 45% coverage), hydrocarbon residues (C₈-C₂₀ alkanes, 3-5 µm thickness), and metallic oxides (Fe₂O₃, 2% coverage). Surface roughness increases to Ra 8.2±0.3 µm from baseline 2.5 µm. The rubber's high absorption coefficient (8500 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) and low thermal conductivity (0.15 W/m·K) create challenging thermal management conditions. Contaminants reduce effective laser coupling efficiency by 35% due to increased reflectivity (0.18 vs 0.08 baseline). AFM reveals particulate embedment depths of 1.2-2.8 µm into the compliant polymer matrix, with cross-sectional analysis showing 15% porosity in contamination layers. The amorphous polymer structure with carbon-black filler (20% vol) displays compromised interfacial adhesion at contamination boundaries.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength, 0.9 J/cm² fluence (90% of ablation threshold), and 100 kHz repetition rate achieves complete contaminant removal with minimal substrate modification. Surface roughness reduces to Ra 2.8±0.2 µm, approaching the original 2.5 µm specification. XPS analysis confirms 99.2% carbon retention with only 0.3% oxygen increase, indicating minimal oxidation. AFM measurements show preserved polymer microstructure with <50 nm surface modification depth. Thermal analysis confirms bulk temperature remained below 120°C, preventing rubber degradation (T_g = -72°C). Profilometry documents 98.7% contaminant removal efficiency with <0.5% mass loss. SEM reveals intact carbon-black filler distribution and preserved cross-link density. The processed surface maintains original mechanical properties: hardness 61±1 Shore A, tensile strength 24.8 MPa, demonstrating optimal laser parameter selection for this composite system.
