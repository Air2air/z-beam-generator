  At 500x magnification, the rubber surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, discontinuous film. This layer, measuring approximately 15—or more precisely—14.7 µm in average thickness, appears as a dark, mottled crust obscuring the underlying substrate texture. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of exogenous elements, including silicon and calcium, which are consistent with environmental particulate and process residue.

The contamination layer itself displays significant topographical variation, with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 8.2 µm. This high roughness value corresponds to a visually coarse morphology featuring embedded particulate matter and numerous micro-fissures. The original rubber microstructure—typically a composite of filler particles within a polymer matrix—is entirely masked by this adherent, opaque deposit, preventing any assessment of the base material's integrity.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, fully restoring the native rubber composite surface. The contaminant layer is completely ablated, revealing the underlying polymer matrix and carbon black filler particles. Post-cleaning Ra measurements show a significant reduction to 2.1 µm, a value that aligns with the material's original, as-manufactured specification. This translates to a visually smooth, homogeneous surface at 500x.

We observe no thermal degradation or ablation of the rubber substrate itself, which indicates precise parameter control. The cleaning process selectively removed the contaminant film while preserving critical surface features. The restored surface now exhibits a uniform, matte texture, and its reflectivity has decreased due to the exposure of the inherent micro-roughness of the composite.

This cleaned state directly enables enhanced performance in sealing applications, as the intimate contact between mating surfaces is no longer compromised by an intermediate, weakly-bound layer. The surface integrity is fully maintained, with XPS analysis confirming the absence of a chemically modified layer—
