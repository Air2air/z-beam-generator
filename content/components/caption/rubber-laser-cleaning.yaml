# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the rubber Laser cleaning of rubber utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively remove contaminants without damaging the underlying rubber substrate. The 1064nm wavelength provides optimal absorption in rubber compounds, enabling controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving mechanical properties.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The rubber exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The rubber substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal damage.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
