  At 500x magnification, the rubber surface is heavily obscured by a complex contamination layer. A dense, particulate-laden film—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—uniformly coats the substrate. This layer consists of carbonaceous soot agglomerates (2-5 µm in diameter) embedded within a matrix of oxidized hydrocarbon residues. The underlying rubber texture is completely masked, presenting a topographical landscape with a measured roughness (Ra) of 8.7 µm, a significant increase from the substrate's inherent 3.2 µm.

The contamination exhibits clear stratification. The uppermost region is a friable, loosely-bound deposit, while the interface with the rubber substrate shows evidence of chemical bonding and potential minor degradation. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms foreign elements, including silicon (from environmental dust) and sulfur, integrated into the film. This composite layer significantly alters the surface's functional properties, increasing light absorption and reducing its inherent elasticity in the affected zone. The deposits fill the natural micro-porosity of the rubber, which typically measures around 2.5%.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a complete restoration of the native rubber substrate. The contamination layer has been entirely ablated, exposing the original polymer matrix with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of 3.5 µm—a value that aligns closely with the material's specified baseline of 3.2 µm. The laser process successfully removed the foreign deposits without inducing significant bulk thermal damage, preserving the rubber's mechanical integrity.

The surface now displays its characteristic micro-texture from the molding process, with clearly defined peaks and valleys. The material's natural porosity—approximately 2.5%—is fully reopened and visible. Some minor, sub-micron scale texturing is observable in localized areas, a direct result of the laser's interaction with the rubber's high absorption coefficient; this actually enhances the surface area without compromising the substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the removal of contaminant elements, leaving a chemically clean surface dominated by carbon and oxygen signatures consistent with the base rubber formulation. The process effectively restored the surface's functional geometry and reflectivity.
