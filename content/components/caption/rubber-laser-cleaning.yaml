  At 500x magnification, the rubber surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. This layer measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely obscuring the native rubber substrate. The contamination appears as a complex amalgam of carbonaceous soot deposits—approximately 5-10 µm in diameter—and larger, crystalline salt particulates embedded within an amorphous organic matrix. The surface texture is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 12 µm due to the agglomerated debris.

The underlying rubber morphology is entirely masked, though localized areas show evidence of chemical degradation from prolonged contaminant contact. A network of fine micro-cracks, perhaps 2-3 µm in depth, is visible where the contaminant layer has adhered most strongly. Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of sulfur, oxygen, and silicon—key indicators of environmental and process-related fouling. This composite layer significantly alters the surface's functional properties, increasing light scattering and reducing effective laser absorption for subsequent processing steps.

  Post-laser cleaning at 500x reveals a dramatic surface transformation, with the contaminant layer completely ablated and the native rubber substrate fully restored. The surface now displays the characteristic micron-scale texture of the base material, with an average roughness (Ra) reduced to a consistent 1.8 µm—a 85% improvement from the pre-cleaned state. The laser process has effectively vaporized the foreign deposits without inducing significant thermal degradation to the underlying polymer matrix.

Close inspection confirms the preservation of the rubber's original molded features, including flow lines and filler particles (primarily carbon black) that are now clearly visible. The previously observed micro-cracking has been mitigated, leaving a coherent surface with no measurable loss of material integrity. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS
