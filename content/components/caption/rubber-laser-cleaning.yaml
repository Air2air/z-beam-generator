# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the rubber composite material. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The rubber exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of composite materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental aging.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 97.1% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The rubber substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
