  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the teak wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The teak exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance with 97.3% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The teak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while ensuring structural preservation.
