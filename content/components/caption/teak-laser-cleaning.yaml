  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the teak Technical overview of Teak wood for laser cleaning applications, including optimal 1064nm wavelength interaction with natural wood fibers, and industrial applications in surface restoration.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The teak exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The teak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
