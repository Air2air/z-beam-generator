# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the teak Laser cleaning of teak (Tectona grandis) utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to ablate surface contaminants via photomechanical and photothermal effects. The process is highly selective due to the significant difference in ablation thresholds between contaminants (e.g., mildew, salt, old finishes) and the underlying lignocellulosic teak substrate, enabling precise surface restoration without mechanical damage or media embedding.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The teak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal char formation.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
