  Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals significant contamination deposits across the teak wooden substrate. 
  Microscopic analysis shows oxide layers and surface oxidation adhering to the surface. The teak exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of wood materials.
  The contamination appears to be from biological activity and environmental factors.

after_text: |
  Treatment outcome assessment demonstrates exceptional cleaning performance through comprehensive laser processing.
  The teak substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved fiber structure.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while ensuring structural preservation.
