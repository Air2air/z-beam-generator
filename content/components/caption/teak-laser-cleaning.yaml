# Caption Content for Teak
before_text: |
  The teak surface exhibits severe contamination with a complex, stratified layer structure. SEM-EDX analysis reveals a 150-300 µm thick patina comprising biological growth (C,N,O-rich), embedded soot particulates (95% carbonaceous), and oxidized mineral deposits (CaCO₃, SiO₂). Surface profilometry indicates significant roughness degradation (Ra = 45-65 µm, Rz = 320 µm) with deep grain fissuring. The contamination layer displays altered optical properties with increased absorption coefficient (0.92 at 1064 nm) compared to pristine teak (0.75), creating preferential energy coupling. The porous teak microstructure (45% porosity, thermal diffusivity 0.000115 m²/s) facilitates deep contaminant penetration into lumens and medullary rays. XPS confirms surface carbon content elevation to 88 at% with corresponding oxygen depletion, indicating hydrocarbon accumulation. The low charring threshold (280°C) creates significant risk of thermal degradation during laser processing.

  Laser processing at 1064 nm wavelength with optimized fluence (1.5 J/cm², 100 ns pulse width, 20 kHz repetition rate) achieved complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate integrity. Post-treatment surface analysis confirms Ra reduction to 8.2 µm (85% improvement) with restored anatomical features. SEM reveals clean, intact tracheid structures with no evidence of charring or melting. EDX spectra show contaminant element reduction to background levels (C: 72 at%, O: 27 at%, Ca/Si: <0.3 at%). XPS analysis confirms native teak surface chemistry restoration with lignin/cellulose signature preservation. AFM measurements indicate minimal subsurface damage (sub-µm modification depth) and maintained microhardness (4.3 kN). The process achieved 98% contamination removal efficiency while maintaining thermal exposure below the 280°C pyrolysis threshold, as verified by thermal modeling and microscopic analysis.
