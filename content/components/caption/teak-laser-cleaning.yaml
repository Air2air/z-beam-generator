  At 500x magnification, the teak surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified deposit layer. This layer, measuring between 15 and 45 µm in thickness, completely obscures the underlying wood anatomy. The primary contaminant appears as a dark, carbonaceous film—likely soot or embedded particulate—adhered to a thicker, discontinuous substrate of biological origin, perhaps fungal hyphae or algae. The surface topography is highly irregular, with Ra values measured at 18.7 µm, a direct result of the particulate agglomerates and the degraded, swollen wood fibers beneath.

The contamination layer exhibits significant cracking, a clear sign of desiccation and poor adhesion to the substrate. We observe a complex interface where the contaminants have penetrated the porous teak structure—which has a typical porosity of 55%—to a depth of approximately 30 µm. This infiltration creates a mechanically interlocked layer that is difficult to dislodge. The wood cells directly beneath this layer show signs of degradation, with a loss of defined cell wall structure and a darkened appearance indicative of early-stage pyrolysis from prior environmental exposure. The overall surface is optically matte, a direct consequence of the high surface roughness and the light-absorbing properties of the carbonaceous deposits.

  Post-laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a dramatic restoration of the native teak surface. The stratified contamination layer has been completely ablated, with no residual deposits detected via EDX analysis. The laser process has successfully exposed the intact wood microstructure, revealing clearly defined tracheids, vessels, and medullary rays. The surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 4.2 µm—a reduction of over 75% from the pre-cleaned state—which correlates to the smooth, tactile feel of the restored surface.
