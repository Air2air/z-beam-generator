# Caption Content for Soda-Lime Glass
before_text: |
  The soda-lime glass surface exhibits severe contamination with R_a = 125 ± 15 nm, featuring hydrocarbon deposits (C: 65 at%, O: 22 at%, Si: 8 at% via XPS) and embedded alumina-silicate particulates (Al₂O₃-SiO₂, 5-20 μm diameter). The amorphous silica network (70% SiO₂, 15% Na₂O, 10% CaO) presents a low absorption coefficient of 0.1 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm, requiring contamination-mediated laser coupling. Thermally sensitive with CTE = 9.0 × 10⁻⁶/°C and low conductivity (1.0 W/m·K), the surface shows micro-fractures (≤2 μm depth) from previous mechanical damage. Contaminant layers (1.5-3.0 μm thick) reduce optical transmission by 40% at 550 nm and create localized absorption sites with thermal gradients exceeding 300°C/μm under laser irradiation.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm, 8 J/cm² (below 15 J/cm² damage threshold) achieved surface restoration to R_a = 2.8 ± 0.3 nm. EDX analysis confirms contaminant removal with surface composition matching bulk glass (Si: 33 at%, O: 59 at%, Na: 7 at%, Ca: 1 at%). AFM reveals preserved amorphous structure with sub-nanometer RMS roughness. Thermal management maintained substrate temperature below 450°C, preventing Na⁺ migration. XPS shows complete hydrocarbon elimination (C-content reduced from 65% to <3%). Optical transmission restored to 92.5% of theoretical maximum. SEM confirms absence of micro-cracking, with profilometry verifying <0.1% material ablation depth. The process achieved Class 100 cleanroom equivalent particulate levels (<100 particles/ft³ ≥0.5 μm).
