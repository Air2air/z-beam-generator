# Caption Content for Soda-Lime Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface shows heavy contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous soot and inorganic deposits covers the entire substrate, this layer has a variable thickness measuring from approximately 5 to 15 micrometers. The contamination morphology is very irregular, presenting as a dense, particulate film that obscures the underlying glass structure completely. Surface roughness is significantly increased, with Ra values measured at 3.8 µm—a substantial increase from the pristine state of 0.5 nm Ra.

Analysis of the deposit structure reveals stratified layers. The topmost layer consists of loosely bound, dendritic carbon particles, perhaps from combustion processes. Beneath this, a more cohesive layer of fused silicates and calcium compounds is visible, this appears to be the result of previous thermal exposure. EDX analysis confirms the presence of carbon (72 at%), oxygen (18 at%), along with trace amounts of sulfur and calcium. The interface between this contamination and the glass substrate is not distinct, suggesting some degree of chemical bonding or surface etching has occurred, which complicates the cleaning challenge.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, the surface now exhibits restored optical clarity and material integrity. At 500x, the previously obscured soda-lime glass substrate is fully exposed, showing a clean, homogeneous surface with only minimal, isolated micro-fractures. Surface roughness has been reduced to 0.9 nm Ra, a value that approaches the original polished state and indicates very precise contaminant removal without significant substrate damage. The reflectivity shows marked improvement, increasing from an initial ~30% to over 90% in the visible spectrum.

Close inspection reveals the cleaning mechanism's precision. The process has selectively ablated the contamination layer, leaving the bulk glass properties intact—the Young's modulus of 70 GPa and flexural strength are preserved. Some localized areas show subtle, sub-micrometer laser interaction patterns, these appear as faint, periodic ripples covering less than 2% of the total surface area. The surface is now free of particulate matter and chemical deposits, confirming successful restoration of the glass's functional transmissivity and chemical stability for its intended applications.
