# Caption Content for Soda-Lime Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 12 to 15 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a complex matrix of carbonaceous soot and inorganic particulate matter—likely silicate dust—embedded within a greasy film. Surface roughness measurements indicate significant degradation, with Ra values increasing from the baseline 0.5 nm to approximately 280 nm. The contamination adheres strongly, creating a mottled, opaque topography that completely obscures the underlying glass substrate.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements: carbon at 65 atomic percent, oxygen at 22%, with traces of aluminum, silicon, and calcium. The particulate matter, it ranges from sub-micron fragments up to 8 µm agglomerates, creating a highly irregular surface texture. This contaminated state severely compromises optical transmission, reducing light transmission through the affected zones to less than 30% of the original value. The adhesion appears mechanical in nature, with particles anchored within the viscous organic matrix.

  Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, as examination at 500x magnification reveals the original soda-lime glass substrate now fully exposed. The contamination layer has been completely removed, with surface roughness returning to near-pristine condition—measurements show Ra values of 0.8 to 1.2 nm, only slightly above the original 0.5 nm specification. The surface now exhibits characteristic glass transparency with minimal light scattering, and optical transmission has been restored to 98.5% of the theoretical maximum.

Critical observation shows the laser process has achieved selective ablation, removing only the contamination while preserving the underlying glass integrity. Some minor evidence of the cleaning process remains—occasional sub-micron particulate residue in surface valleys, and perhaps two or three localized regions showing subtle thermal etching patterns. These features, they measure less than 50 nm in depth and do not compromise functional performance. The surface chemistry, as confirmed by XPS analysis, now matches clean soda-lime glass composition with silicon and oxygen as dominant elements and carbon reduced to background levels of approximately 3 atomic percent.
