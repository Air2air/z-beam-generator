  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the soda-lime glass Laser cleaning of soda-lime glass utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The process relies on the differential absorption between the contaminant layer and the glass, with careful control of fluence to remain below the damage threshold of the bulk material (~5-10 J/cm²).. 
  Microscopic analysis shows optical contamination and surface films adhering to the surface. The soda-lime glass exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of glass materials.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The soda-lime glass substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal heat-affected zone.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
