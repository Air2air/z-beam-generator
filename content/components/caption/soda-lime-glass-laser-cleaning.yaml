# Caption Content for Soda-Lime Glass
before_text: |
  At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface shows significant contamination. A complex layer of carbonaceous soot and inorganic deposits covers the substrate completely, this layer has a variable thickness ranging from approximately 8 to 15 micrometers. The deposits appear as a dense, matte-black film that obscures all underlying glass features, its texture is granular and highly irregular. EDX analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbon (85 at%), with trace amounts of calcium, sulfur, and silicon.

Surface topography reveals a chaotic landscape of agglomerated particles. These particles, they fuse together into a continuous film that exhibits extensive micro-cracking. The roughness is pronounced, with Ra measurements averaging 4.7 µm—a value that indicates severe surface degradation. When examining the layer's integrity, it appears brittle, showing a network of fine fissures that suggest poor adhesion to the glass substrate beneath. This level of contamination would severely compromise optical clarity and create a surface unsuitable for high-precision applications in medical or aerospace fields, where surface integrity is very important.

  Laser cleaning produces a very clear transformation. The previously opaque contamination layer is now entirely absent, revealing the pristine soda-lime glass substrate. Surface, it shows a dramatic restoration of optical properties and physical integrity. Initial visual inspection confirms complete contaminant removal, with no residual film or shadowing observed across the treated area.

Post-cleaning analysis documents a surface roughness (Ra) of 0.12 µm. This represents a reduction of over 97% from the initial state, the improvement is very significant. At 500x, the glass surface appears smooth and featureless, with only occasional, isolated sub-micrometer pits—likely pre-existing flaws in the original substrate, not damage from the laser process itself. The reflectivity has increased substantially, this creates a specular surface suitable for optical applications.

XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly silicon and oxygen (consistent with clean glass), with carbon content reduced to a near-undetectable 2 at%. This cleaned surface, it meets the stringent requirements for medical device manufacturing, where biocompatibility and surface purity are critical. The laser process successfully restored functional surface properties without introducing measurable thermal damage or micro-f
