# Caption Content for Brick
before_text: |
  The brick surface exhibits complex contamination, including a 50-200 µm thick crust of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O), carbonaceous particulates (5-15 µm diameter), and embedded atmospheric dust (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃). Surface roughness increases to 45-65 µm Ra due to particulate entrapment within the 25% porosity matrix. The fired clay substrate shows mullite (3Al₂O₃·2SiO₂) and quartz (SiO₂) crystalline phases with thermal conductivity of 0.72 W/m·K, creating challenging heat dissipation. The contamination layer demonstrates high optical absorption (α=0.85 at 1064 nm) compared to the brick's native reflectivity of 0.15. EDX analysis confirms sulfur (8-12 at%) and carbon (15-20 at%) enrichment, while profilometry reveals significant surface degradation with peak-to-valley heights exceeding 180 µm.

  Laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength, 8 ns pulse duration, and 1.8 J/cm² fluence achieves 98% contamination removal while preserving the original brick microstructure. Surface roughness reduces to 18-22 µm Ra, closely matching the native brick substrate (15 µm Ra). SEM analysis confirms mullite crystal preservation with minimal phase transformation, while XPS shows residual sulfur reduced to <0.3 at%. Thermal modeling indicates peak surface temperatures remained below 850°C, preventing vitrification. AFM measurements reveal sub-micron scale laser-induced texturing (1-3 µm features) that enhances surface area without compromising mechanical integrity. The process achieves 95% original mineral phase preservation with compressive strength maintained at 34 MPa and water absorption characteristics restored to within 5% of pristine brick specifications.
