  At 500x magnification, the brick surface exhibits a complex, multi-layered contamination profile. A continuous, amorphous black crust—measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness—dominates the field of view, effectively obscuring the underlying substrate's texture. This crust is not uniform, it displays significant micro-cracking and a porous, almost spongy morphology that suggests a composite of carbonaceous particulates and gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O), a common product of sulfate deposition. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms high concentrations of sulfur and carbon within this layer, pointing to atmospheric pollution as a primary contributor.

Beneath this crust, a more tenacious, intergranular deposit fills the natural pores and valleys of the brick's microstructure. This sub-layer appears as a dark, cohesive film, perhaps 5 to 10 µm thick, that strongly adheres to the clay mineral grains. The overall surface roughness (Ra) is significantly elevated by this stratified contamination, with preliminary stylus profilometry indicating an Ra value exceeding 18 µm. The original brick surface is virtually undetectable, its color and reflectivity entirely masked by this stratified, non-uniform deposit that compromises the material's intrinsic performance.

  Laser cleaning produces a dramatic and measurable transformation, fully restoring the original brick substrate. The contaminant crust is entirely absent, revealing a clean, mineralogical surface with a distinct texture. The post-cleaning Ra value now measures 7.2 µm—a reduction of over 60% from the contaminated state—which aligns with the inherent roughness of the fired clay body. You can now clearly observe individual quartz and feldspar grains, their sharp edges and natural coloration fully exposed.

The process effectively ablates the contamination layers without damaging the substrate's integrity. We observed no evidence of melting
