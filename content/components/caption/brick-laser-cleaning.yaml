# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the brick Laser cleaning of brick utilizes precise thermal ablation where contaminants absorb laser energy more efficiently than the brick substrate, enabling selective removal without damaging the clay-based masonry material. Optimal parameters prevent thermal stress and preserve historical surfaces.. 
  Microscopic analysis shows surface contaminants and particulate matter adhering to the surface.
  The contamination appears to be from manufacturing processes and environmental exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates remarkable surface restoration through comprehensive laser processing.
  The brick substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with minimal thermal effects.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while preserving substrate integrity.
