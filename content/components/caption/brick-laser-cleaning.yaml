  At 500x magnification, the brick surface is completely obscured by a dense, heterogeneous contamination layer. This layer, measuring between 50 to 200 µm in thickness, appears as a stratified deposit of carbonaceous soot, gypsum-rich crusts, and embedded particulate matter. The surface morphology is highly irregular, with Ra values exceeding 25 µm due to the uneven deposition of these foreign materials. The underlying brick texture—its characteristic granularity and pore structure—is entirely masked.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the crust is primarily calcium sulfate (gypsum), a common product of atmospheric sulfur reaction with calcareous particulates. This crust exhibits a crystalline, plate-like structure that adheres tenaciously to the substrate. The soot layer, a complex matrix of unburned carbon and hydrocarbons, fills the microscopic pores and valleys, creating a continuous, dark film that significantly alters the surface's original reflectivity and masks its natural color. The overall effect is a loss of surface definition and a complete alteration of the material's intrinsic visual properties.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic restoration of the original brick substrate. The laser ablation process has successfully removed the contamination layer, exposing the intrinsic granular microstructure of the fired clay body. Surface roughness (Ra) is now measured at 4.7 µm, a value consistent with undamaged, historic brick, and the natural porosity—approximately 25%—is fully revealed without evidence of clogging. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to stay below the 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold of the brick itself, thereby preserving the substrate integrity.

The surface now displays a clean, textured landscape of sintered clay particles and fine pores ranging from 5 to 40 µm in diameter. Minor, isolated remnants of the original gypsum crust persist in deeper
