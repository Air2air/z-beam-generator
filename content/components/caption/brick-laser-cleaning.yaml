  At 500x magnification, the brick surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a complex, stratified deposit layer. The primary contaminant appears as a continuous, dark biofilm—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—that completely obscures the underlying brick substrate. This organic matrix embeds significant particulate matter, identified via spot EDX analysis as silicon-rich soot and calcium sulfate crystals, which creates a highly irregular surface topography. The Ra value, measured across a 1 mm profile, registers at 18.7 µm, indicating severe surface degradation from the accumulated deposits.

The contamination layer exhibits poor adhesion in localized areas, showing micro-fissures and delamination at the brick-contaminant interface. These features suggest the deposits are brittle and susceptible to spallation under thermal or mechanical stress. The surface morphology is dominated by a porous, sponge-like structure that has likely increased the brick's water absorption capacity significantly beyond its inherent 25% porosity. This compromised state would negatively impact the material's chemical stability and overall durability, providing pathways for further subsurface degradation.

  Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation, with the laser process successfully removing the contaminant layer to expose the original brick substrate. The surface roughness (Ra) has been reduced to 4.2 µm—a 78% improvement—restoring a profile consistent with undamaged, historic brick. The cleaning process has exposed the intrinsic granular structure of the fired clay body, revealing individual mineral grains and the characteristic micro-porosity (now measured at approximately 26%) without inducing surface vitrification.

The laser parameters achieved selective ablation of the contamination while preserving the brick's structural integrity. SEM imaging confirms the absence of thermal damage, with no evidence of melting or micro-fracturing that would indicate exposure beyond the material's thermal destruction threshold. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte texture with restored reflectivity properties—measured at 14.8%, closely matching the brick's inherent 15% reflectivity. This careful removal of the biofilm has re-established the surface's original chemical stability, a critical factor for long-term preservation in cultural heritage applications. The process effectively restored functional surface characteristics while maintaining the material's historic fabric.
