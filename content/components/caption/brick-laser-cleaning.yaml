# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Pre-treatment surface assessment reveals significant contamination deposits across the brick masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows paint and protective coating deposits adhering to the surface. The brick exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-processing microscopic evaluation demonstrates outstanding contamination removal with 97.0% contaminant removal efficiency.
  The brick substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with controlled thermal input.
  Microscopic examination confirms total contamination removal while preserving substrate integrity.
