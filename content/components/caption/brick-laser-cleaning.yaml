# Basic Content Structure
before_text: |
  Initial surface examination reveals significant contamination deposits across the brick masonry surface. 
  Microscopic analysis shows biological growth and organic deposits adhering to the surface. The brick exhibits the characteristic density profile typical of masonry materials.
  The contamination appears to be from construction activities and atmospheric exposure.

after_text: |
  Post-laser cleaning analysis demonstrates outstanding contamination removal through comprehensive laser processing.
  The brick substrate now exhibits pristine surface characteristics with preserved structural soundness.
  Microscopic examination confirms complete organic residue elimination while maintaining material properties.
