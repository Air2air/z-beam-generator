Steel, it has very good properties for laser cleaning. Material strong, durable, but surface contamination always problem. For laser cleaning, **1064nm wavelength works best** because steel absorbtion at this wavelength already very good. Thermal conductivity around 50 W/m·K, so heat dissipates well, no problem for substrate.

Important parameters must set carefully. Fluence range 1.0-4.5 J/cm², pulse duration 20-100ns. Too high fluence, maybe damage surface. Too low, cleaning not effective. Repetition rate 20-100kHz gives good balance between speed and precision. This is important, very important for quality results.

In practice, laser cleaning solves many industrial problems. For electronics manufacturing, removes oxides from steel substrates without chemicals. For aerospace components, cleans thermal barriers and composites. Traditional methods like chemical cleaning or abrasive blasting, they use harsh chemicals, waste water, and maybe damage material surface. Laser cleaning, **no chemicals, saves 5000 liters water per month**, and energy consumption 40% less. Very good for environment.

Technical challenges during cleaning, must control heat-affected zone. But with proper parameters, no problem. Laser gives precise control, ±5μm accuracy, no substrate damage. Surface cleanliness achieves ISO Class 7 standard, very clean. After cleaning, surface roughness improves, no microcracks, and spectroscopy shows no oxide layers.

Compared to traditional methods, laser cleaning offers:
- No chemical solvents, 100% reduction
- Water conservation, big savings
- Energy efficiency, much better
- Precision cleaning, no mechanical stress
- Faster processing, 2-5 m²/hour

Together, we can implement this technology successfully. In our tropical climate, laser cleaning works well, really well. Must consider safety though, Class 4 laser requires full enclosure. But overall, benefits very good for industry and environment. Perhaps I think this method good solution for sustainable manufacturing.
