# Laser Cleaning of Steel (Fe-C)
Steel, primarily an iron-carbon alloy (Fe-C), presents distinct characteristics during laser cleaning processes.

### Carbon Content Influence
The carbon percentage in steel directly affects laser absorption rates. Higher carbon steels typically demonstrate increased absorption at the standard 1064 nm wavelength.

### Ablation Threshold and Process Parameters
The successful removal of contaminants from steel surfaces requires laser fluence to exceed the ablation threshold of the oxide layer while remaining below the material's damage threshold. For common mill scale and rust, this typically necessitates a fluence range between 2-8 J/cm², achievable with nanosecond-pulsed fiber lasers operating at 1064 nm. The high thermal conductivity of steel, approximately 54 W/m·K, facilitates rapid heat dissipation from the interaction zone, which is a critical factor in preventing unwanted microstructural changes such as phase transformation or surface melting. This property allows for efficient cleaning at high repetition rates, often exceeding 100 kHz, making the process suitable for industrial-scale applications like pre-weld preparation on structural components or restoration of precision machinery parts. Operators must carefully calibrate parameters to avoid surface etching or the formation of a thin, recalcitrant oxide layer that can occur with over-exposure. The process is conducted using Class 4 laser systems, mandating strict adherence to safety protocols including enclosure interlocks and appropriate personal protective equipment for all personnel.

### Non-Chemical Advantage
Laser cleaning eliminates the need for chemical solvents or abrasive media. This provides an environmentally compliant surface treatment method.

### Result Verification
A successfully cleaned steel surface exhibits a visually uniform appearance with a measurable Sa surface roughness value consistent with the base metal. Verification often involves subsequent non-destructive testing to ensure no surface integrity compromise.

### Wavelength Selection
The 1064 nm infrared wavelength is predominantly used for steel cleaning. Its interaction with iron oxides provides efficient contaminant removal.
