In practice, laser parameters must set carefully. Fluence range 0.5–10.0 J/cm² good for remove rust, paint, salt deposits. Pulse duration 50-200ns also important. Too long, heat can affect material; too short, maybe not clean properly. Repetition rate 20-300kHz allows for fast cleaning, no problem. For ship hulls or car parts, this method very efficient.

Main advantage? **No chemicals needed**, so environment safe. Also, no abrasives, so no surface damage. Traditional methods like sandblasting or chemical washing can leave residue or cause corrosion. Laser cleaning, it precise, very precise. Only remove what you want. Surface ready for welding or coating, already clean.

In automotive industry, laser cleaning removes paint and rust from body panels. For marine applications, it cleans biofouling and salt from ship hulls. Heavy machinery also benefits—large steel components get prepared for protection. It works well, really well, no problem.

Success indicators? Surface roughness must be low, no oxide layers left. Spectroscopy can confirm clean surface. Also, no microcracks—structural integrity maintained. This method fast, cost-effective, and good for environment. Perhaps, I think, for Indonesia's tropical climate and many ports, laser cleaning very suitable for maintenance. Together, we can implement this technology for better infrastructure.
