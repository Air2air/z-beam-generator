## Abstract

Stoneware, a dense, vitrified ceramic, is a critical material in demanding engineering applications ranging from advanced insulators and chemical processing equipment to specialized wear components. Its service life is often compromised by the accumulation of surface contaminants—oxides, carbon deposits, salts, and biological growth—which can degrade its functional properties. Traditional cleaning methods, while effective, often introduce mechanical stress, chemical waste, or subsurface damage. Laser cleaning has emerged as a superior, non-contact alternative. This article provides a detailed technical analysis of stoneware's physicochemical properties, its primary industrial applications, and the intricate mechanisms governing its laser cleaning process. We examine the critical laser parameters, the challenges of thermal management, and the quantifiable metrics for validating cleaning efficacy. A comparative analysis against traditional methods underscores the advantages of laser technology in preserving the structural integrity and extending the operational lifespan of high-performance stoneware components.

## 1. Material Properties of Stoneware and Their Impact on Laser Interaction

Stoneware is defined by its high firing temperature (typically 1200°C–1300°C), which causes vitrification—the transformation of clay body into a glassy, impermeable matrix. This process bestows upon it a unique set of properties that directly influence laser cleaning efficacy.

*   **Composition and Microstructure:** Primarily composed of silica (SiO₂), alumina (Al₂O₃), and various fluxing oxides (e.g., Fe₂O₃, K₂O, Na₂O). The microstructure is a complex, heterogeneous mix of crystalline phases (e.g., mullite, quartz) embedded within a continuous glassy phase. This heterogeneity is crucial; different phases will have slightly different **ablation thresholds** and thermal responses, requiring a laser process that effectively cleans the composite without selectively ablating one phase.

*   **Thermal Properties:** Stoneware possesses relatively **low thermal conductivity** (≈1.5 W/m·K) and a **high specific heat capacity**. This combination means that heat from the laser pulse is not rapidly dissipated away from the impact zone. While this can be beneficial for efficiently heating contaminants, it poses a significant risk of creating a **large heat-affected zone (HAZ)** or inducing **thermal shock** and microcracking if energy input is not meticulously controlled.

*   **Optical Properties:** The surface reflectivity and absorption coefficient are highly dependent on the glaze (if present), surface finish, and wavelength of the laser. For instance, a dark, unglazed stoneware body has a high absorption coefficient for the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths of common Nd:YAG lasers (1064 nm), making it efficient for energy transfer. Conversely, a light-colored or glazed surface may reflect a significant portion of the energy, necessitating parameter adjustment.

*   **Mechanical Properties:** High compressive strength but relatively **low fracture toughness** and tensile strength. This brittleness makes stoneware highly susceptible to damage from mechanical shock or localized thermal stress, a key reason why non-contact laser cleaning is advantageous.

## 2. Tailoring Laser Parameters for Stoneware Cleaning

The success of laser cleaning is contingent on the precise selection of parameters to exploit the difference in ablation threshold between the contaminant and the stoneware substrate.

*   **Wavelength (λ):** The primary mechanism for cleaning organics (soot, biofilms) and many inorganic deposits (salts) is often photochemical ablation or photothermal degradation. For these, UV wavelengths (e.g., 355 nm from a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG) can
