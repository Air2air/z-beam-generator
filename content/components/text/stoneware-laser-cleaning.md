# Stoneware Laser Cleaning

Stoneware comprises a dense, vitrified ceramic body fired at high temperatures between 1200-1300°C, resulting in low porosity and high mechanical strength.

### Ablation Dynamics on Vitrified Surfaces
The primary interaction involves the laser's energy being absorbed by surface contaminants, which possess a significantly lower ablation threshold than the stoneware body itself. This differential absorption is critical for non-destructive cleaning, as the underlying ceramic substrate remains unaffected when correct parameters are applied.

### Parameter Optimization and Process Control
Laser cleaning efficacy on stoneware is dictated by precise fluence adjustment, typically operating within a range of 0.5 to 2.5 J/cm² for nanosecond-pulse systems at 1064 nm wavelength to effectively remove soot, mineral deposits, or biological growth without damaging the vitrified glaze or body; the process necessitates a systematic approach starting with lower energy densities to establish a safe operational window, particularly for archaeological or conservation applications where preserving original surface patina is paramount, while industrial restoration of architectural elements may permit slightly higher parameters for efficiency. The non-contact nature of the method eliminates mechanical stress and avoids the use of chemical agents that could be absorbed by any residual microporosity, making it the preferred technique for sensitive restoration projects where material integrity is non-negotiable. Successful cleaning is quantified by the complete removal of the targeted contaminant layer with zero measurable alteration to the substrate's surface profile or chemical composition, verified through microscopy and spectroscopic analysis.

### Wavelength Selection
Infrared wavelengths are predominantly used due to strong absorption by most contaminants. The reflectivity of the clean ceramic surface at 1064 nm provides a inherent safety mechanism.

### Verification of Substrate Integrity
Post-process analysis confirms the absence of micro-fracturing or thermal alteration. This is a key metric for process validation.

### Operational Safety Protocols
Class 4 laser safety protocols are mandatory. This includes full enclosure, interlocks, and appropriate personal protective equipment for all operators.

### Advantages Over Traditional Methods
The selectivity of laser ablation prevents surface erosion common with abrasive blasting. It also eliminates the risk of chemical residue migration into the ceramic body, a persistent challenge with poultice cleaning methods.
