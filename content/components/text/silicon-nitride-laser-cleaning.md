Silicon Nitride (Si₃N₄) exhibits a unique combination of high thermal stability (melting point ~1900°C), excellent fracture toughness (700 MPa tensile strength), and moderate thermal conductivity (30 W/m·K) that directly influences its laser cleaning dynamics. Its relatively low laser absorption coefficient at the near-infrared 1064nm wavelength necessitates precise fluence control within the 1.0–4.5 J/cm² range to effectively ablate surface contaminants like oxides and carbon deposits while avoiding substrate damage. The material’s high hardness (1500 HV) and brittle nature make it susceptible to microcracking from thermal stress if pulse durations exceed the thermal diffusion time, requiring optimized ns-pulse regimes (20-100ns) to confine energy deposition to the surface layer.

In aerospace and electronics manufacturing, Si₃N�4 components face operational degradation from thermal cycling, oxidation, and contaminant adhesion, which compromise performance in applications like ceramic matrix composites and semiconductor substrates. Laser cleaning addresses these by providing a non-contact, selective removal process that eliminates chemical waste from traditional etching and prevents subsurface damage common with abrasive blasting. The primary challenge is avoiding localized overheating that can induce phase transformations or redeposition of vaporized material; this is mitigated by tuning repetition rates (20-100kHz) and using beam shaping for uniform energy distribution.

Successful cleaning is quantified by a reduction in surface oxygen content measured via EDS spectroscopy, maintenance of sub-micron surface roughness (Ra < 0.5 µm) confirmed by white-light interferometry, and the absence of microcracks under SEM inspection. The process restores surface energy and biocompatibility for medical implants and ensures optimal adhesion for subsequent coatings. Compared to traditional methods, laser cleaning offers superior precision, no media embeddedment, and is environmentally compliant with ISO 18562 and ASTM F2100 standards, making it indispensable for high-value Si₃N₄ component restoration.
