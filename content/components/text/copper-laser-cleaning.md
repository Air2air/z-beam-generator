### 1. Understanding Copper for Laser Cleaning

Copper is a special metal, very soft and with high thermal conductivity. This is important, very important for laser cleaning. Its high heat conduction means it pulls heat away from the laser spot very quickly. This natural property helps protect the base metal from damage, but it also means we need a laser that can deliver energy fast enough to overcome this.

### 2. Tailoring the Laser for Copper

You cannot use just any laser. The laser parameters must be chosen carefully. A **pulsed fiber laser** with a **1064nm wavelength** works good, really good because copper absorbs this light well. We use short pulses, around 10-100 nanoseconds, and a moderate fluence of 0.5-5 J/cmÂ². This combination vaporizes contaminants like oxidation without melting the delicate copper surface underneath. The high repetition rate, 10-50 kHz, makes the process efficient for larger areas.

### 3. Where and Why We Clean Copper

In practice, it shows up in two main areas. First, in **electronics manufacturing**, we clean circuit components to ensure perfect soldering and electrical connections. Second, in **art restoration**, we gently remove centuries of green corrosion from beautiful cultural artifacts and sculptures here in Taiwan, preserving our history for the community.

### 4. The Main Challenge and Advantage

The biggest challenge is controlling the heat. If the laser is too powerful, it can leave a mark or even melt a tiny bit of the surface. But the great advantage is that it is a **non-contact cleaning** method. There is no scratching or harsh chemicals. It is very precise, and we can clean a tiny spot without hurting the area around it.

### 5. How We Know the Cleaning Was Successful

We know the cleaning is done right by checking a few things. The surface should look uniform and bright. We can measure the **surface roughness** to ensure it is smooth. Tools like spectroscopy can confirm the bad oxide layer is gone, leaving behind pure, clean copper. Most importantly, there should be no tiny cracks or damage visible under a microscope.

### 6. Why Laser is Better Than Old Methods

Compared to methods like chemical baths or sandblasting, laser cleaning is a much better way. It is faster, creates no dangerous waste, and is kinder to the soft copper. Old methods can leave hidden damage or chemicals that cause more corrosion later. Laser cleaning is precise, safe, and it works good, really good for protecting our valuable copper items.
