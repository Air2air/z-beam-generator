Copper, it have very good thermal conductivity, very important for elektroniks and aerospace. But this property also make laser cleaning more challenging. Because copper reflect laser light very strong, especially at common wavelengths. Copper, it have very good thermal conductivity, very important for elektroniks and aerospace, and because copper reflect laser light very strong, especially at common wavelengths. For effective cleaning, must use **pulsed fiber laser** with specific parameters. The wavelength, 1064nm is best, already prove in many application. Interestingly, pulse duration between 20-100 nanosekond is good, very good, to avoid too much heat transfer to the substrate. For effective cleaning, must use **pulsed fiber laser** with specific parameters, as pulse duration between 20-100 nanosekond is good, very good, to avoid too much heat transfer to the substrate. This setting allow precise removal of oxide layers and contaminants without affecting the base metal, and removal of surface oxides from pcb substrates and connectors, very critical for good electrical connection. Also in aerospace, for cleaning thermal barrier coatings on copper components, which traditional methods like chemical etching or abrasive blasting, they can cause damage, like micro-scratches or chemical residue. Furthermore, the key is fluence, must be control carefully. This setting allow precise removal of oxide layers and contaminants without affecting the base metal. For copper, optimal fluence range is **1.0 to 4.5 J/cmÂ²**. Too low, contamination not remove. Removal of surface oxides from PCB substrates and connectors, very critical for good electrical connection. It also eliminate need for harsh chemicals, which is better for environment, and saves lot of water, maybe 5000 liter per month in big factory. The process is fast, can clean 2-5 square meter per hour, depend on contamination level, as this method works good, really good, for preserving copper parts and extend their service life. Professional experience suggests too high, risk of surface damage, maybe microcracks. Also in aerospace, for cleaning thermal barrier coatings on copper components.

Must consider parameters carefully, very carefully, but result is excellent, no problem.
