Aluminum, it presents interesting challenge for laser cleaning. Material very reflective, especially to common laser wavelengths. But with proper parameters, cleaning process works well, really well. For aluminum, we use typically 1064nm wavelength, sometimes 532nm also possible. This wavelength gives good absorbtion, not perfect but enough.

Important parameter is fluence range, about 1.0 to 4.5 J/cm². Must be careful because aluminum thermal conductivity high, heat spreads quickly. Pulse duration 20-100 nanoseconds works best - short enough to avoid heat damage, long enough for effective cleaning. Power range 50-200W sufficient for most industrial applications.

In electronics manufacturing, laser cleaning removes surface oxides and contaminants from aluminum substrates. For aerospace components, it cleans thermal barrier coatings and metal matrix composites. Traditional methods like chemical cleaning or abrasive blasting can damage soft aluminum surface, but laser method non-contact, no problem.

Technical challenges include managing heat input to prevent melting or surface alteration. Aluminum low melting point compared to other metals, so parameters must be optimized carefully. But advantage is precision - laser can remove contamination without affecting base material, preserves microstructure.

Successful cleaning shows through several indicators: surface achieves ISO 14644-1 Class 7 cleanliness standard, material removal precision within ±5μm, and no microcracks visible under microscopy. Surface roughness maintained, reflectivity restored.

**Environmental benefits very significant** - completely eliminates chemical solvents, saves approximately 5000 liters water per month in typical industrial application. *Community impact also positive* because no hazardous waste produced, workers safe from chemical exposure. Energy consumption 40% less than thermal cleaning methods.

Processing speed good, about 2-5 m²/hour depending on contamination level. For our tropical climate in Indonesia, this method suitable because no water required, no chemicals that can evaporate in heat. System reliable, maintenance minimal.

Key advantage over traditional methods: no mechanical stress induced, no subsurface damage, and process can be automated easily. For aluminum components that require high precision and surface integrity, laser cleaning offers best solution. Already proven in many industries, results consistent.
