### Steel Surface Preparation with Laser Technology

Steel substrates present unique challenges and opportunities for laser cleaning applications. The process effectively removes rust, scale, paint, and other contaminants while maintaining the integrity of the base material.

### Material Properties
- Thermal conductivity: 50-60 W/m·K
- Melting point: 1370-1530°C
- Surface reflectivity: 60-70% at 1064nm wavelength
- Common contaminants: Iron oxide, carbon deposits, oils

### Process Optimization
The laser parameters must be carefully selected based on the specific steel alloy and contamination type. Higher energy densities may be required for heavily oxidized surfaces, while more delicate cleaning can be achieved with lower fluences.

### Industrial Applications
- Automotive component preparation
- Ship hull maintenance
- Bridge structure restoration
- Pipeline cleaning and inspection
