# Fiberglass (N/A) Overview
Fiberglass is a composite material consisting of glass fibers embedded within a polymer resin matrix.

### Composite Ablation Dynamics
Laser cleaning parameters must be precisely calibrated to the specific resin system. The ablation threshold for the surface contaminant must be lower than that of the underlying resin to prevent matrix damage.

### Operational Parameter Optimization
The fundamental principle involves utilizing a laser wavelength, typically 1064 nm, with a nanosecond pulse duration to selectively remove contaminants without degrading the thermoset polymer. This process requires meticulous control over energy density, or fluence, which is typically maintained within a range of 1-5 J/cmÂ² to effectively ablate oxides, paints, or biological growth while preserving the integrity of the resin surface. Industrial applications are extensive, including the restoration of wind turbine blades, where mechanical abrasion is unsuitable, and the preparation of boat hulls for recoating. A key technical challenge is the varying absorption rates between the contaminant and the resin; excessive fluence can cause localized heating, leading to resin charring or micro-fractures within the glass fibers. Successful cleaning is quantitatively verified by a measured increase in surface energy to above 72 dynes/cm for improved coating adhesion and the complete absence of residue as confirmed by spectroscopic analysis. The primary advantage over chemical stripping is the elimination of solvent permeation into the porous matrix, which can cause long-term degradation, and the avoidance of creating hazardous waste streams requiring special disposal.

### Wavelength Interaction
The 1064 nm wavelength is predominantly absorbed by the contaminant layer. Minimal absorption by the underlying composite is critical for a non-destructive process.

### Process Advantages Over Alternatives
Laser ablation provides a dry and contactless cleaning method. It eliminates the risk of fiber exposure associated with sandblasting.
This method ensures no mechanical stress is applied to the substrate.

### Technical Outcome Verification
Quantifiable results include the restoration of precise dimensional tolerances on composite parts. Surface profilometry confirms the absence of material removal from the base substrate.

### Safety and System Configuration
Operation requires a Class 4 laser system with integrated fume extraction to handle ejected particulates and any volatile organic compounds released from the resin during ablation. Technical specifications mandate the use of optical safety barriers and personal protective equipment, including wavelength-specific laser goggles, to mitigate the risk of ocular damage from reflected or scattered radiation. The process is highly repeatable with modern systems capable of operating at repetition rates from 20-100 kHz, allowing for efficient processing of large surface areas common in aerospace and marine industries where fiberglass is prevalent due to its high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.
