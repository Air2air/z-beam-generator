The laser light at 1064nm wavelength, it interacts different with glass fibers and with resin. Fiberglass composite, this material very special for many application. Additionally, this short pulse important to avoid heat damage to polymer resin. Field experience shows the laser light at 1064nm wavelength, it interacts different with glass fibers and with resin, as this short pulse important to avoid heat damage to polymer resin. Meanwhile, in electronics manufacturing, fiberglass substrates need clean surface for proper circuit connection. Material composition, it has silica glass fibers and polymer resin. Together, they make strong but lightweight material. For laser cleaning, this combination important, very important. Consequently, in practice, must consider carefully, very carefully. Industry analysis shows in practice, laser cleaning for fiberglass uses pulsed fiber laser. Parameters must be precise. Power range around 50-200W good, very good.
