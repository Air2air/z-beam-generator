# Porcelain Overview
Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic material primarily composed of kaolin, quartz, and feldspar, characterized by its high density and low thermal conductivity.

### Ablation Dynamics on Vitrified Surfaces
Laser cleaning of porcelain differs from metals due to its significantly lower thermal conductivity of 1.5 W/m·K. This property necessitates precise parameter control to manage heat accumulation within the material substrate.

### Parameter Optimization and Industrial Application
The primary industrial application for laser-cleaned porcelain is in the restoration and conservation of historical artifacts and architectural elements, where its non-abrasive nature preserves intricate surface details. Effective contaminant removal is achieved using a 1064 nm wavelength laser, as this infrared light is well-absorbed by common surface contaminants while being reflected by the underlying white porcelain body, creating a high selectivity that protects the substrate. The process requires nanosecond pulse durations to generate peak powers sufficient for ablation while minimizing thermal diffusion into the bulk material, which is critical given its melting point of 1400°C. A key challenge is avoiding thermal shock and the potential for micro-cracking due to localized thermal stress, which is mitigated by optimizing fluence levels typically between 1-4 J/cm². Successful cleaning is quantified by a return to the original surface whiteness, measured by spectrophotometry, with no measurable change in surface roughness or topography. The primary advantage over chemical or abrasive methods is the complete absence of secondary waste or mechanical surface wear, allowing for the cleaning of delicate glazed surfaces without affecting the finish.

### Process Advantages
Laser cleaning is selected for its precision and lack of chemical residues. It provides a non-contact method that eliminates the risk of mechanical damage associated with traditional techniques.

### Technical Outcome Metrics
A successful intervention is confirmed by spectroscopic analysis showing the removal of foreign elements. The surface integrity is verified by microscopic examination for any sub-surface damage.
