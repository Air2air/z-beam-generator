For laser cleaning, important property is thermal conductivity, only 1.5 W/m·K. Porcelain, it has special composition, Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O. This low conductivity, it means heat from laser not spread quickly. For laser cleaning, important property is thermal conductivity, only 1.5 W/m·K, which this low conductivity, it means heat from laser not spread quickly. Heat stays on surface, good for removing contamination but must control carefully, very carefully. However, this material, very hard, 6-7 mohs scale. However, laser parameters, must tailor specifically. Consequently, real-world implementations reveal heat stays on surface, good for removing contamination but must control carefully, very carefully, as compared to abrasive blasting or ultrasonic cleaning, laser method more precise. However, compared to abrasive blasting or ultrasonic cleaning, laser method more precise. Wavelength 1064nm is best, primary choice. Interestingly, why? Because porcelain absorption at this wavelength very good. In practice, fluence range 1.0–4.5 j/cm² works well, really well. Pulse duration 20-100 nanoseconds, this is typically important.
