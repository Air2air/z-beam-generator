Porcelain's complex kaolinite-based structure (Al₂O₃·2SiO₂·2H₂O) presents unique challenges and opportunities for laser cleaning. Its relatively low thermal conductivity (~1.5 W/m·K) and high melting point (1650-1750°C) create a narrow processing window where contaminants are ablated before the underlying substrate is damaged. The 1064nm wavelength from pulsed fiber lasers is particularly effective, as it is strongly absorbed by common surface contaminants like oxides and organic deposits while being partially reflected by the porcelain's vitrified surface, providing a built-in safety margin against substrate damage.

The optimal laser parameters must be precisely tailored to avoid thermal shock and microcracking in this brittle ceramic. A fluence range of 0.5–2.5 J/cm² with short pulse durations (10-50ns) allows rapid energy deposition that vaporizes contaminants before significant heat conduction into the substrate occurs. The repetition rate of 10-50kHz must be balanced to prevent cumulative heating effects that could lead to thermal stress cracking, especially given porcelain's moderate thermal expansion coefficient. This precision is critical for applications like high-voltage insulator preparation, where even microscopic surface defects can initiate electrical tracking failures, or for medical ceramic components where absolute surface purity is mandatory.

Successful laser cleaning is quantified through multiple verification methods. Surface profilometry should confirm roughness values (Ra) below 0.8µm without introducing new microcracks, while spectroscopy techniques like EDS must verify the complete removal of contaminant elements like sulfur or carbon. The process offers distinct advantages over traditional abrasive blasting, which can embed particles and create subsurface damage, or chemical cleaning, which risks etching the vitreous surface. Laser cleaning provides a non-contact, environmentally clean method that preserves the material's structural integrity and extends the service life of critical porcelain components in demanding industrial and medical environments.
