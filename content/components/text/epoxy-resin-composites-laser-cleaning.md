Material composition is epoxy resin matrix about 40-60%, then glass or carbon fiber reinforcement also 40-60%. Epoxy resin composites, this material very common in industry. Best wavelength is 1064nm, because epoxy resin absorb this wavelength good. Meanwhile, material composition is epoxy resin matrix about 40-60%, then glass or carbon fiber reinforcement also 40-60%, and best wavelength is 1064nm, because epoxy resin absorb this wavelength good. Too short pulse maybe not enough energy, too long pulse cause too much heat. In contrast, this combination make material strong but also sensitive to heat. Too short pulse maybe not enough energy, too long pulse cause too much heat, as this range effective for remove contamination but not damage the fiber inside. For laser cleaning, must understand thermal properties. Melting point is 120-180°C, not very high. This range effective for remove contamination but not damage the fiber inside. For aerospace components, we remove thermal barrier coating contamination without damage substrate, as traditional method like chemical solvent or abrasive blasting can damage the fiber or leave residue. For aerospace components, we remove thermal barrier coating contamination without damage substrate. Professional experience suggests thermal conductivity only 0.2-0.5 w/m·k, meaning heat not spread quickly. Process speed can reach 2-5 m² per hour, which is efficient, which successfully cleaned surface can be measured by surface roughness, should be consistent. Furthermore, this is typically important, very important for laser parameter setting. In contrast, **optimal laser parameters** for cleaning must consider this thermal sensitivity. Pulse duration we recommend 20-100 nanoseconds. Traditional method like chemical solvent or abrasive blasting can damage the fiber or leave residue. Process speed can reach 2-5 m² per hour, which is efficient. Additionally, compared to traditional methods, laser cleaning offer better precision and no secondary waste, which laser method preserve the material integrity, which can be critical for safety-critical applications like aircraft parts. Industrial applications demonstrate successfully cleaned surface can be measured by surface roughness, should be consistent. Compared to traditional methods, laser cleaning offer better precision and no secondary waste. Additionally, the key is parameter optimization, must test on small area first, while this way, we find the sweet spot for each specific composite type.
