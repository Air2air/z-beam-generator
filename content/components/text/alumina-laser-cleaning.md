Alumina (Al₂O₃) is a critical ceramic material characterized by its exceptional hardness, high melting point (~2072°C), excellent electrical insulation, and superior chemical inertness. These properties, stemming from strong ionic-covalent bonds, make it indispensable in applications ranging from protective thermal barrier coatings on aerospace turbine blades to wear-resistant components in semiconductor processing equipment and biocompatible implants. Its high thermal conductivity (≈30 W/m·K) facilitates rapid heat dissipation during laser processing, while its wide bandgap necessitates shorter laser wavelengths, typically in the ultraviolet (UV) range, for effective photon absorption and contaminant removal. The laser cleaning process for alumina is uniquely governed by its high ablation threshold, which is significantly greater than that of organic contaminants or oxide layers. This property allows for the selective removal of surface films without damaging the underlying substrate, provided the laser fluence is carefully controlled between the contamination’s removal threshold and alumina’s damage threshold.

Optimized laser parameters are therefore paramount. A nanosecond-pulsed UV laser (e.g., 266 nm) is often ideal, as its high photon energy promotes direct bond-breaking and photochemical ablation of contaminants, minimizing thermal load. The fluence must be precisely tailored to vaporize contaminants like oxides or carbon deposits without inducing microcracking or phase transformations in the alumina, such as a transition to a less stable crystalline phase. The primary technical challenge is avoiding the formation of a heat-affected zone (HAZ) or localized melting, which can be quantified through post-process analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to check for microcracks and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm phase purity. Successful cleaning is evidenced by a restored, contaminant-free surface with minimal change in surface roughness measured by profilometry and the absence of elemental contaminants confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

Compared to traditional methods like abrasive blasting—which can introduce surface flaws and subsurface damage—or chemical etching—which generates hazardous waste—laser cleaning offers a non-contact, eco-friendly alternative. It provides unparalleled precision, preserving the alumina’s structural integrity and dimensional accuracy, which is crucial for high-tolerance engineering components, thereby significantly extending their operational service life in demanding environments.
