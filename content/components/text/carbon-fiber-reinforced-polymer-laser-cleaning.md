#### **Recommended Laser Parameters**

| Parameter | Value / Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Laser Type** | Pulsed Fiber Laser |
| **Wavelength** | **1064 nm** (IR) |
| **Pulse Duration** | 10 - 200 ns |
| **Fluence Threshold** | 1.0 – 10 J/cm² |
| **Power Range** | 50 - 200 W |
| **Repetition Rate** | 20 - 100 kHz |
| **Spot Size** | 0.05 - 1.0 mm |

**Note:** These parameters are a general guideline. Optimal settings are highly application-specific and depend on the exact resin system, fiber weave, and desired outcome. Extensive testing on sample pieces is **strongly recommended**.

#### **Primary Surface Treatments**

*   **Laser Ablation:** Precisely removes thin layers of the polymer matrix to prepare surfaces for bonding or repair. Requires careful parameter tuning to avoid fiber exposure or burning.
*   **Laser Cleaning:** An effective method for the non-contact removal of release agents, mold residues, and other contaminants from CFRP parts without the use of chemicals or abrasive media.
*   **Non-Contact Cleaning:** Ideal for delicate aerospace and automotive components where mechanical contact must be avoided to prevent surface damage.

#### **Key Applications**

*   **Aerospace:** Removal of release agents and surface contaminants from CFRP parts such as fuselage panels and wing components to ensure optimal adhesion for painting and bonding.
*   **Automotive:** Cleaning of CFRP components (e.g., body panels, structural elements) to improve the quality and durability of adhesive bonds and paint finishes.
