#### **Material Overview**
Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer is a high-performance composite material known for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness. Laser processing of CFRP is a highly complex procedure due to its anisotropic and heterogeneous nature. The primary challenge is the significant difference in ablation thresholds between the carbon fiber and the polymer matrix. Precise control is essential to achieve desired results without damaging the underlying fibers or causing matrix degradation.

#### **Recommended Laser Parameters**

| Parameter | Value / Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Laser Type** | Pulsed Fiber Laser |
| **Wavelength** | **1064 nm** (IR) |
| **Pulse Duration** | 10 - 200 ns |
| **Fluence Threshold** | 1.0 – 10 J/cm² |
| **Power Range** | 50 - 200 W |
| **Repetition Rate** | 20 - 100 kHz |
| **Spot Size** | 0.05 - 1.0 mm |

**Note:** These parameters are a general guideline. Optimal settings are highly application-specific and depend on the exact resin system, fiber weave, and desired outcome. Extensive testing on sample pieces is **strongly recommended**.

#### **Primary Surface Treatments**

*   **Laser Ablation:** Precisely removes thin layers of the polymer matrix to prepare surfaces for bonding or repair. Requires careful parameter tuning to avoid fiber exposure or burning.
*   **Laser Cleaning:** An effective method for the non-contact removal of release agents, mold residues, and other contaminants from CFRP parts without the use of chemicals or abrasive media.
*   **Non-Contact Cleaning:** Ideal for delicate aerospace and automotive components where mechanical contact must be avoided to prevent surface damage.

#### **Key Applications**

*   **Aerospace:** Removal of release agents and surface contaminants from CFRP parts such as fuselage panels and wing components to ensure optimal adhesion for painting and bonding.
*   **Automotive:** Cleaning of CFRP components (e.g., body panels, structural elements) to improve the quality and durability of adhesive bonds and paint finishes.
