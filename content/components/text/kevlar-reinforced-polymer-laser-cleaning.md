*Community impact positive because method effectively removes chemical solvents*, protects worker health. Kevlar-reinforced polymer, this material very special for many applications. But advantages significant: no mechanical stress, precision cleaning, and **environmental benefits substantial**. Verify results with quality check Benefits clear: - No chemical waste - Energy efficiency 40% better than thermal methods - Processing speed 2-5 m²/hour - Precision ±5μm accuracy Perhaps, I think this technology already represents good solution for modern industry. Furthermore, traditional methods like chemical etching use harmful substances, but laser cleaning completely effectively removes this problem. Material composite, with Kevlar fibers and polymer matrix together. *Community impact positive because method effectively removes chemical solvents*, protects worker health, as but advantages significant: no mechanical stress, precision cleaning, and **environmental benefits substantial**. Already proven in several factories here in Indonesia, results very satisfactory. Traditional methods like chemical etching use harmful substances, but laser cleaning completely effectively removes this problem, while already proven in several factories here in indonesia, results very satisfactory. Field experience shows strength very high, thermal resistance also good. For laser cleaning, this material requires careful approach, very careful. **Material properties** like thermal conductivity low, only 0.04 W/m·K. This important because heat doesn't spread much during laser process. Ablation threshold for this material around 1.0–4.5 J/cm².
