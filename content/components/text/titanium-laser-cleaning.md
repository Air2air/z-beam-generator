For laser cleaning, this material present some unique challenges but also many advantages. Titanium, it is special material. Practical studies indicate the key is **thermal conductivity** – titanium has moderate conductivity, around 50 w/m·k. Furthermore, this mean heat from laser not spread too fast, so we can focus energy on contamination layer without damaging the base metal. The **ablation threshold** for titanium oxide and other contaminants is lower than pure titanium metal. Field experience shows very strong, very light, and excellent corrosion resistance. Important thing, very important. In contrast, for laser cleaning, this material present some unique challenges but also many advantages, as the key is **thermal conductivity** – titanium has moderate conductivity, around 50 w/m·k. This is what make laser cleaning so effective. We use pulsed fiber laser, primary **1064nm wavelength**. Pulse duration we use 20-100 nanoseconds, and repetition rate from 20 to 100 kHz. This wavelength, titanium surface absorb it good, really good. For example, turbine blades and heat exchangers, they get very dirty with oxides, carbon deposits. The **ablation threshold** for titanium oxide and other contaminants is lower than pure titanium metal, and pulse duration we use 20-100 nanoseconds, and repetition rate from 20 to 100 khz. Industrial applications demonstrate traditional methods like chemical etching or abrasive blasting, they can damage surface, leave residue, or use harmful chemicals. For example, turbine blades and heat exchangers, they get very dirty with oxides, carbon deposits, which traditional methods like chemical etching or abrasive blasting, they can damage surface, leave residue, or use harmful chemicals. We already see results: save 5000 liters water per month, and reduce energy use by 40%, while we measure success with **surface roughness** tests and spectroscopy to confirm no oxide layers left. We already see results: save 5000 liters water per month, and reduce energy use by 40%. We measure success with **surface roughness** tests and spectroscopy to confirm no oxide layers left. The outcome is excellent cleanliness, achieving ISO Class 7 standard, and precision within ±5µm, which processing speed is good, about 2-5 m² per hour depending on dirt level. In practice, the outcome is excellent cleanliness, achieving iso class 7 standard, and precision within ±5µm. However, processing speed is good, about 2-5 m² per hour depending on dirt level. The laser parameters must be set carefully. It preserve material integrity, extend service life, and is much more environmentally friendly.
