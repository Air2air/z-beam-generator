title: Fiberglass Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Fiberglass laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove
    surface contaminants while preserving the glass fiber reinforcement and polymer
    matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and
    the composite substrate, with optimal results achieved at 1064 nm wavelength where
    epoxy resin exhibits moderate absorption while glass fibers remain transparent.
