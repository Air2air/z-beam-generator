title: Terracotta Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Terracotta laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove
    surface contaminants while preserving the fragile clay matrix. The process exploits
    differential absorption between contaminants and the iron-rich clay body, with
    optimal results achieved at near-infrared wavelengths where terracotta exhibits
    lower absorption coefficients than most surface deposits.
