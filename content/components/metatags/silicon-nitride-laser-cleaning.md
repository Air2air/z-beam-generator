<meta name="description" content="Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) is a high-performance ceramic material known for its excellent thermal shock resistance and mechanical strength. In laser cleaning applications, Si3N4's low thermal expansion and high hardness make it an ideal candidate for precise and non-contact surface treatment. The material's robust nature allows it to withstand the high-intensity pulses of laser ablation, ensuring effective removal of contaminants without damaging the underlying structure. This makes Silicon Nitride particularly suitable for applications in semiconductors and automotive industries where surface integrity is critical.">
