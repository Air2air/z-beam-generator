title: Maple Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Maple wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its
    cellulose-lignin composition and moderate absorption characteristics. The 1064nm
    wavelength provides effective ablation of surface contaminants while minimizing
    thermal damage to the wood substrate when using appropriate fluence parameters.
