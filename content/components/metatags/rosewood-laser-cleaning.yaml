title: Rosewood Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Rosewood (Dalbergia spp.) utilizes precise pulsed laser
    energy to ablate surface contaminants (dirt, finishes, oxidation) while preserving
    the delicate lignin and cellulose structure of the wood. The process is highly
    selective, non-abrasive, and avoids the use of harmful chemicals, making it ideal
    for valuable artifacts and high-quality furniture.
