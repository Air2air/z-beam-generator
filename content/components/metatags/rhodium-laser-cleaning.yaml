title: Rhodium Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of rhodium utilizes short pulses from a fiber laser to selectively
    ablate surface contaminants. Rhodium's high reflectivity (~80% at 1064 nm) and
    thermal conductivity require precise fluence control to overcome reflectivity
    and achieve efficient ablation without melting the precious metal substrate.
