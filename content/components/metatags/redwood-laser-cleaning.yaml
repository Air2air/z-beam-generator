- name: description
  content: Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber
    laser parameters optimized for its unique cellular structure and chemical composition.
    The process effectively removes contaminants while preserving the wood's natural
    characteristics through controlled ablation at specific fluence thresholds.
