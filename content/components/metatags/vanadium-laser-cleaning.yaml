meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Vanadium laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers at 1064nm wavelength
    to selectively ablate surface contaminants and oxides from vanadium and its alloys.
    The process leverages vanadium's moderate thermal conductivity (30.7 W/m·K) and
    specific absorption characteristics at near-IR wavelengths for precise, non-contact
    cleaning without altering the base metal's metallurgical properties.
