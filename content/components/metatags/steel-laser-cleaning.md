<meta name="description" content="Steel, known chemically as Fe-C, is a versatile alloy widely used in various industries due to its strength and durability. Laser cleaning of steel involves the use of high-intensity laser beams to remove contaminants like rust, paint, oil, and oxides from the surface. This non-contact method ensures minimal damage to the steel's microstructure, making it ideal for applications where surface integrity is crucial. The process leverages the material properties of steel, such as its high melting point and thermal conductivity, to efficiently ablate unwanted layers without compromising the underlying steel.">
