<meta name="description" content="Technical overview of Borosilicate Glass, B2O3-SiO2, for laser cleaning. Borosilicate Glass, composed primarily of boron trioxide (B2O3) and silicon dioxide (SiO2), is highly valued in laser cleaning applications due to its exceptional thermal and chemical resistance. This material's low coefficient of thermal expansion makes it ideal for laser processing, allowing for precise cleaning without compromising structural integrity. The use of 1064nm wavelength lasers with a fluence range of 0.5–5 J/cm² and pulse durations between 10-100ns ensures effective removal of contaminants while maintaining the glass's surface quality.">
