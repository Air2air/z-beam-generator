title: Teak Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of teak (Tectona grandis) utilizes pulsed near-infrared
    radiation to ablate surface contaminants via photomechanical and photothermal
    effects. The process is highly selective due to the significant difference in
    ablation thresholds between contaminants (e.g., mildew, salt, old finishes) and
    the underlying lignocellulosic teak substrate, enabling precise surface restoration
    without mechanical damage or media embedding.
