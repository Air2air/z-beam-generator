title: Alumina Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of alumina (Al₂O₃) utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers
    to selectively remove surface contaminants through ablation while preserving the
    ceramic substrate's structural integrity. The process exploits alumina's high
    thermal stability and absorption characteristics at specific wavelengths for non-contact,
    chemical-free cleaning.
