title: Beech Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Beech wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its
    cellulose-lignin composition. The 1064nm wavelength provides effective absorption
    while minimizing thermal damage, enabling precise removal of surface contaminants
    without altering the wood's natural structure.
