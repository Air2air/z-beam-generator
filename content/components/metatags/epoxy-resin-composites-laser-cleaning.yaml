title: Epoxy Resin Composites Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of epoxy resin composites utilizes precise pulsed fiber
    laser parameters to selectively remove surface contaminants while preserving the
    thermoset polymer matrix and reinforcing fibers. The process operates through
    controlled thermal ablation mechanisms optimized for the composite's specific
    absorption characteristics.
