meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Silver laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to selectively
    remove surface contaminants through ablation while preserving the high-purity
    silver substrate, leveraging silver's exceptional thermal conductivity (429 W/m·K)
    for controlled energy dissipation.
