title: Thermoplastic Elastomer Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of TPE utilizes precise nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers to
    selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the underlying polymer
    matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and
    the TPE substrate, achieving non-contact cleaning with micron-level precision
    and no solvent waste.
