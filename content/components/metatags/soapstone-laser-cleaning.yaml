title: Soapstone Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of soapstone utilizes precise Nd:YAG laser parameters to
    selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the talc-rich mineral
    matrix. The low thermal conductivity (6.4 W/m·K) and specific heat capacity allow
    controlled energy deposition without thermal damage to the substrate.
