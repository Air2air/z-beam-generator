title: Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers Gfrp Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of GFRP utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to
    selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the
    glass fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix. The process operates below the ablation
    threshold of the composite material (typically 0.5-1.5 J/cm² for epoxy-based GFRP)
    to ensure non-destructive removal of coatings and contaminants.
