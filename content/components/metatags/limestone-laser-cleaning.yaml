title: Limestone Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of limestone (calcium carbonate) utilizes precise pulsed
    laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the delicate stone
    substrate. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants
    and the limestone matrix, typically using near-infrared wavelengths that are well-absorbed
    by dark surface deposits but less absorbed by the lighter mineral substrate.
