title: Slate Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Slate laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface
    contaminants while preserving the underlying metamorphic rock structure. The process
    exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the slate substrate,
    with optimal parameters targeting 1064nm wavelength for effective removal of organic
    and inorganic deposits without thermal damage to the phyllosilicate matrix.
