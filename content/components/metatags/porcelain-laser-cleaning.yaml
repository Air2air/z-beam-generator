title: Porcelain Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Porcelain laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove
    surface contaminants through selective ablation, leveraging the material's high
    thermal stability (1350°C melting point) and mechanical hardness (7 Mohs). The
    process preserves the underlying ceramic structure while removing organic and
    inorganic surface layers.
