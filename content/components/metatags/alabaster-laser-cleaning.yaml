title: Alabaster Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of alabaster utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove
    surface contaminants while preserving the delicate dihydrate gypsum structure.
    The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the
    alabaster substrate, typically using IR wavelengths for crust removal and visible
    wavelengths for finer work on sensitive surfaces.
