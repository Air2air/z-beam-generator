title: Hafnium Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Hafnium laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove
    surface contaminants and oxides from hafnium components without damaging the substrate.
    The process leverages hafnium's high melting point (2233°C) and specific absorption
    characteristics at 1064nm wavelength for precise material processing.
