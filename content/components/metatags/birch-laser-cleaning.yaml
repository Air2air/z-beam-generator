title: Birch Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Birch wood responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning due to its
    cellulose and lignin composition. The 1064 nm wavelength provides effective absorption
    for controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the underlying
    wood structure through precise thermal management.
