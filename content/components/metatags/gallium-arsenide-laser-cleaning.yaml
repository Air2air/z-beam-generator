title: Gallium Arsenide Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Gallium Arsenide utilizes precise, pulsed near-infrared
    radiation to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying
    semiconductor crystal lattice. The process is non-contact, avoids chemical waste,
    and is critical for high-yield manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.
