title: Brass Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of brass (Cu-Zn alloy) exploits the high absorption of near-IR
    wavelengths by zinc oxide tarnish layers. The process utilizes short pulses to
    selectively ablate contaminants while the high thermal conductivity of brass (109-125
    W/m·K) rapidly dissipates heat, preventing melting or zinc depletion at the surface.
