meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of stucco utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters
    to selectively remove contaminants while preserving the calcium carbonate and
    cementitious matrix. The process operates below the ablation threshold of stucco
    (0.5 J/cm²) while effectively removing organic and inorganic surface deposits.
