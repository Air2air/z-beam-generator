title: Concrete Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of concrete utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively
    ablate surface contaminants through rapid thermal expansion and vaporization.
    The process exploits the differential absorption characteristics between contaminants
    and the calcium silicate hydrate matrix of concrete, enabling precise removal
    without mechanical damage or chemical residue.
