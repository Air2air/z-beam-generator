title: Ash Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Ash wood (Fraxinus spp.) responds optimally to near-infrared laser cleaning
    due to its cellulose/lignin composition. The 1064nm wavelength provides strong
    absorption in lignin components, enabling precise ablation of surface contaminants
    while preserving the wood substrate integrity.
