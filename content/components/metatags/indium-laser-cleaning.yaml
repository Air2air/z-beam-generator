meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of indium requires precise control due to its low melting
    point (156.6°C) and softness. Pulsed fiber lasers at 1064 nm provide optimal absorption
    for removing oxides and contaminants without melting or damaging the pure indium
    substrate, crucial for maintaining electrical and thermal properties in sensitive
    applications.
