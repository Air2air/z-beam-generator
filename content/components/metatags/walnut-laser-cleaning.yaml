title: Walnut Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of walnut (Juglans spp.) utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser
    parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants. The process
    exploits the differential absorption characteristics between the contamination
    layer and the walnut substrate, which is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin, allowing for non-contact, non-abrasive cleaning.
