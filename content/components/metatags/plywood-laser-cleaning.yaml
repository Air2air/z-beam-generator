title: Plywood Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Plywood laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to
    selectively remove surface contaminants without damaging the underlying wood veneer
    layers. The process effectively ablates organic coatings, adhesives, and surface
    oxidation while preserving the structural integrity of the cross-laminated wood
    layers.
