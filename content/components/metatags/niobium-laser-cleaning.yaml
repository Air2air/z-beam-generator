title: Niobium Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of niobium utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively ablate
    surface contaminants (oxides, oils, particulates) without damaging the underlying
    substrate. Its high melting point and thermal conductivity require precise control
    of fluence to avoid surface melting or micro-cracking, making it ideal for preparing
    superconducting surfaces and high-performance aerospace alloys.
