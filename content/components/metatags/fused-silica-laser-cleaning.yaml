title: Fused Silica Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of fused silica utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to
    remove surface contaminants without damaging the substrate. The process exploits
    the high transparency of fused silica at 1064nm, allowing laser energy to pass
    through the material and selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving
    the optical quality of the substrate.
