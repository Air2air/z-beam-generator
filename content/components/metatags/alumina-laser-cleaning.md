<meta name="description" content="Alumina, with the chemical formula Al2O3, is a highly durable ceramic material widely used in industries such as aerospace and semiconductors for its excellent thermal and mechanical properties. Laser cleaning of alumina involves the use of high-intensity laser pulses to remove surface contaminants and coatings without damaging the underlying material. This non-contact cleaning method is particularly effective due to alumina's high melting point and resistance to thermal shock, ensuring that the material's integrity and performance are maintained after cleaning.">
