meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Pyrex (borosilicate glass) laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber
    laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while leveraging Pyrex's low thermal
    expansion coefficient (3.3 × 10⁻⁶/°C) to prevent thermal stress cracking. The
    process selectively ablates contaminants without damaging the underlying glass
    substrate.
