title: Poplar Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Poplar (Populus spp.) utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation
    to achieve controlled ablation of surface layers. The process exploits the differential
    absorption between the contaminants and the lignocellulosic wood substrate, enabling
    precise, layer-by-layer removal without the use of chemicals or abrasive media
    that can damage the soft wood fibers.
