title: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of CFRP utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove
    surface contaminants while preserving the structural integrity of the carbon fiber
    and epoxy matrix. The process exploits differential absorption characteristics
    between contaminants and the composite substrate, with optimal parameters carefully
    balanced to avoid matrix degradation (>300°C) or fiber damage.
