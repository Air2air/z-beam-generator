title: Ceramic Matrix Composites Cmcs Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of CMCs utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser ablation to
    remove surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the ceramic matrix
    and reinforcing fibers. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants
    and the CMC substrate, with parameters carefully controlled to stay below the
    ablation threshold of the SiC matrix (~10 J/cm²) while effectively removing oxides,
    carbon deposits, and other surface layers.
