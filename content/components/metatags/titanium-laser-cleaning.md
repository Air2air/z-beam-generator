<meta name="description" content="Titanium (Ti), a lightweight, corrosion-resistant metal, is extensively used in high-precision industries like aerospace and medical due to its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and biocompatibility. Laser cleaning of titanium surfaces involves the use of short-pulse, high-fluence lasers at 1064nm wavelength to ablate contaminants without altering the underlying material's microstructure. This non-contact method ensures the preservation of titanium's integrity, vital for applications requiring stringent surface cleanliness.">
