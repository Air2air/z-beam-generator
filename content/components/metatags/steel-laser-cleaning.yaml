meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Steel laser cleaning utilizes high-intensity pulsed laser radiation at
    1064nm wavelength to selectively remove surface contaminants through rapid thermal
    expansion and ablation processes. The process effectively removes rust, paint,
    oxides, oils, and other surface contaminants while preserving the underlying steel
    substrate due to differential absorption characteristics.
