title: Inconel Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Inconel requires precise control of fluence to remove
    surface contaminants (oxides, coatings) while avoiding melting or microcracking
    of the Ni-Cr base material. The process leverages high peak power pulses for ablation
    threshold exceedance.
