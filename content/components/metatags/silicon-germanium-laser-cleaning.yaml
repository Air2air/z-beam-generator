title: Silicon Germanium Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Silicon Germanium (SiGe) alloys utilizes precise wavelength
    absorption characteristics at 1064nm where SiGe exhibits strong absorption coefficients
    of 10³-10⁴ cm⁻¹. The process enables selective removal of surface contaminants
    while preserving the crystalline structure and electrical properties of the SiGe
    substrate, critical for semiconductor applications where surface integrity determines
    device performance.
