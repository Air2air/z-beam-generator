title: Willow Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Willow (Salix spp.) wood utilizes precise pulsed fiber
    laser parameters to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants. The process
    exploits the differential absorption characteristics between the contamination
    layer and the lignocellulosic wood substrate, allowing for non-contact, selective
    cleaning without the use of chemicals or abrasive media.
