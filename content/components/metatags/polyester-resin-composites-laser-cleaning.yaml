title: Polyester Resin Composites Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of polyester resin composites utilizes precise pulsed fiber
    laser ablation to remove surface contaminants, oxidation, and coatings. The process
    is governed by the photothermal decomposition of the resin matrix (primarily unsaturated
    polyester) at fluences above its ablation threshold, enabling selective removal
    without damaging the glass fiber reinforcement or altering the bulk material properties.
