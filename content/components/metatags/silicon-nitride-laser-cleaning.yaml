title: Silicon Nitride Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Silicon nitride laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to
    remove surface contaminants from Si3N4 ceramics without chemical solvents or mechanical
    contact. The process leverages the material's high thermal stability and specific
    absorption characteristics at near-IR wavelengths for selective contaminant removal
    while preserving the substrate integrity.
