meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Nickel laser cleaning utilizes precise laser ablation to remove surface
    contaminants, oxides, and coatings without damaging the underlying substrate.
    The process leverages nickel's high thermal conductivity (90.9 W/m·K) and melting
    point (1455°C) for controlled material removal, making it ideal for precision
    industrial applications where chemical cleaning is prohibited or impractical.
