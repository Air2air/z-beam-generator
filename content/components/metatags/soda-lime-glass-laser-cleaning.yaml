title: Soda-Lime Glass Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of soda-lime glass utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation
    to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate.
    The process relies on the differential absorption between the contaminant layer
    and the glass, with careful control of fluence to remain below the damage threshold
    of the bulk material (~5-10 J/cm²).
