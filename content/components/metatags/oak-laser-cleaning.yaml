- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of Oak wood utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters
    to achieve controlled ablation of surface contaminants while preserving the underlying
    lignin-cellulose structure. The 1064 nm wavelength provides optimal absorption
    by both organic contaminants and wood components, enabling selective removal without
    thermal damage to the substrate.
