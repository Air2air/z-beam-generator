meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Hickory laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized
    for the material's high density and complex lignocellulosic structure. The process
    enables selective removal of surface contaminants while preserving the wood's
    natural grain pattern and mechanical properties through controlled thermal ablation
    with minimal heat-affected zone.
