title: Aluminum Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of aluminum utilizes a pulsed laser to selectively ablate
    contaminants like oxides and oils without damaging the underlying substrate. This
    non-contact process is ideal for industrial applications such as weld preparation,
    surface activation for bonding, and restoration of components. Key technical advantages
    include zero chemical waste, minimal surface damage, and precise automation for
    high-volume production.
