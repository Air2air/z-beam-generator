title: Silicon Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of silicon utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove
    surface contaminants without damaging the underlying crystalline structure. The
    process exploits silicon's high thermal conductivity and specific absorption characteristics
    at near-IR wavelengths for selective material removal.
