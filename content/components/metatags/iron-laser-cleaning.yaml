meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Iron laser cleaning utilizes precise laser ablation to remove surface contaminants
    while preserving the base material. The 1064nm wavelength provides optimal absorption
    in iron oxides, enabling selective removal of rust layers at fluences of 1-10
    J/cm² without damaging the underlying pure iron substrate.
