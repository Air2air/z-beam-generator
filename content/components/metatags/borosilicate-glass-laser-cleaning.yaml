title: Borosilicate Glass Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Borosilicate glass laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation
    to remove surface contaminants while preserving the substrate's structural integrity.
    The process exploits the material's high thermal shock resistance and controlled
    absorption at specific wavelengths for selective contaminant removal without thermal
    damage to the glass matrix.
