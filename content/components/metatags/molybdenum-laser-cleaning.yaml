title: Molybdenum Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Molybdenum laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively remove
    surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The process leverages
    Molybdenum's high melting point (2623°C) and thermal conductivity (138 W/m·K)
    to achieve precise ablation of oxides and contaminants while preserving base material
    integrity.
