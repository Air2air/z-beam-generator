title: Brick Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Laser cleaning of brick utilizes precise thermal ablation where contaminants
    absorb laser energy more efficiently than the brick substrate, enabling selective
    removal without damaging the clay-based masonry material. Optimal parameters prevent
    thermal stress and preserve historical surfaces.
