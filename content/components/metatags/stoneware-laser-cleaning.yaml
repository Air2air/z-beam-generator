title: Stoneware Laser Cleaning
meta_tags:
- name: description
  content: Stoneware laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters
    to remove surface contaminants while preserving the vitrified ceramic body. The
    process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the stoneware
    matrix, achieving selective ablation without mechanical contact or chemical residues.
