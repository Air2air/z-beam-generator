description: Technical overview of Iridium, Ir, for laser cleaning. Iridium, symbolized
  as Ir, is a dense, corrosion-resistant metal known for its high melting point and
  excellent electrical conductivity. Laser cleaning of iridium is crucial in industries
  like aerospace and electronics, where precision and non-contact cleaning methods
  are essential to maintain the integrity and performance of iridium components. The
  process utilizes a 1064nm wavelength, with fluences ranging from 1.0 to 10 J/cm²
  and pulse durations of 1-100ns, effectively removing contaminants while preserving
  the material's surface quality.
