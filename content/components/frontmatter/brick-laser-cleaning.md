description: Technical overview of Brick, a durable masonry material, for laser cleaning.
  Brick, primarily composed of clay and other natural minerals, is effectively cleaned
  with laser ablation to remove surface contaminants and efflorescence, crucial for
  both new construction and restoration projects. The process ensures minimal damage
  to the material's structure, preserving the integrity and aesthetic of brick facades.
