caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A porous, amorphous oxide film, approximately 2.5-5 nm thick,
    forms the base, overlaid with patches of carbonaceous soot and embedded abrasive
    particles from prior processing. The topography is irregular, with contamination
    filling the natural grain boundaries and micro-valleys of the substrate. This
    layer significantly increases surface roughness and creates a barrier that degrades
    performance for subsequent processes like welding or bonding, masking the metal's
    inherent properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes all foreign material, revealing the substrate's
    true microstructure. The surface now exhibits a clean, defined grain structure
    with sharp boundaries, free of oxide and particulate residue. Minor sub-surface
    pitting from prior corrosion may remain visible, but the surface roughness is
    substantially reduced. This pristine, metallurgically pure surface provides optimal
    conditions for high-integrity material joining and coating adhesion.
