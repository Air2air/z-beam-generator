"caption":
  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate matter, creating a topographically complex and porous structure. The underlying aluminum's metallic luster is completely absent, replaced by a matte, dark gray appearance with a sooty texture.\n\nThe contamination adheres in discontinuous patches, with some areas showing thicker, crust-like agglomerations. Fine, sub-micrometer particles are visible, trapped within the matrix of the deposit. This heterogeneous layer disrupts the native aluminum's surface, masking its characteristic grain structure and creating a rough, irregular profile that would be detectable to the touch. The surface is non-reflective and lacks any defining metallic features."
  "afterText": "Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The porous contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the underlying aluminum substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, light gray, metallic appearance with clearly defined grain boundaries. The reflectivity has been restored, with the surface showing a characteristic metallic luster absent in the contaminated state.\n\nThe cleaning process has left the native aluminum microstructure fully intact. The surface is now topographically smooth, with only the natural polishing lines and grain structure visible. No residual carbonaceous deposits or embedded particles are observed. This results in a surface free from the microscopic pits and valleys that could harbor contaminants, achieving a state of fundamental cleanliness suitable for high-specification applications."
