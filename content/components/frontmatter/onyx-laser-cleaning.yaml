caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the onyx surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5-10
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of fine, particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film, likely composed
    of organic residues and environmental dust. The underlying banded microstructure of the onyx is partially visible but
    appears muted and texturally uneven due to the coverage.


    The contamination adheres to the stone''s natural micro-fissures and follows the topography of its crystalline structure.
    This creates a mottled, high-contrast pattern that disrupts the material''s inherent translucency and subsurface light
    scattering. The surface reflectivity is measurably reduced, with the film scattering incident light and creating a diffuse,
    matte appearance at the microscopic level.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has resulted in the complete removal of the superficial contamination layer, restoring the intrinsic
    surface of the onyx. The previously obscured banded microstructure is now fully visible, with sharp, defined boundaries
    between the quartz-based mineral layers. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, transitioning from a diffuse,
    matte state to a specular, polished appearance.


    The process has effectively cleared the micro-fissures and pores without inducing thermal damage, such as micro-fractures
    or melting, which is a critical consideration given onyx''s Mohs hardness of 3.0 and thermal properties. The laser parameters
    were tuned to remain below the material''s ablation threshold, ensuring selective removal of contaminants while preserving
    the stone''s structural integrity.


    Comparative analysis confirms the restoration of the stone''s original surface morphology. The visual transformation is
    defined by the elimination of the high-contrast mottling, revealing a uniform, continuous surface with restored translucency.
    The subsurface light scattering characteristic of silicon dioxide minerals is now unobstructed, confirming the successful
    and precise nature of the non-abrasive cleaning process.'
