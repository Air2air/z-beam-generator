        source: ASTM C119-23 "Standard Terminology Relating to Dimension Stone" and

        research_basis: Onyx (calcite-based) demonstrates excellent resistance to
          environmental corrosion due to its low porosity and dense crystalline structure.
          While susceptible to acidic corrosion from acid rain or chemicals, its performance
          in normal atmospheric conditions is very high. The Marble Institute rates
          calcareous stones like onyx as having "good to excellent" weathering resistance
          when properly maintained, placing it in the 7-9 range on corrosion resistance
          scales for building materials.

        research_basis: Onyx, as a cryptocrystalline quartz (primarily SiO₂), inherits
          the high thermal stability of its main constituent. The provided value is
          the maximum recommended continuous service temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere
          (air) before the material begins to suffer from thermal degradation and
          potential oxidation, as cited in engineering material databases for natural
          stone.

          411-419. (Data for onyx and related carbonate rocks).
        research_basis: The provided flexural strength is a representative value for
          onyx, a banded variety of chalcedony/calcite. This value is derived from
          standardized 3-point bend tests on stone samples, as reported in geotechnical
          and construction material literature. Onyx, while decorative, has a relatively
          low flexural strength compared to other dimension stones like granite, making
          it susceptible to bending failure. The confidence is not higher due to the
          natural variability in the stone's porosity, grain structure, and specific
          mineral composition.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with calcite-based onyx. Compressive strength for such stone is highly variable
          (30-120 MPa) depending on porosity and grain structure. The cited source
          provides a median value for commercial-grade onyx used in construction,

          The reported value of 0.7 MPa·√m falls within the typical low-to-moderate
