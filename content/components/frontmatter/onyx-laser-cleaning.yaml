subtitle: Onyx is a softer, more translucent stone that is often banded with multiple
  colors. These properties require lower laser power and careful scanning to prevent
  damage and discoloration.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the onyx surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. Particulate matter, ranging from 5-50 µm in diameter, is embedded in a
    continuous film of organic residue approximately 10-15 µm thick. This layer fills
    the natural micro-fissures and intercrystalline boundaries of the stone, creating
    a matte, occluded appearance. The contaminants exhibit poor adhesion to the substrate,
    forming a discontinuous, flaking stratum that masks the inherent translucency
    and crystalline structure of the onyx.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the pristine onyx substrate. The
    contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the stone's intrinsic
    micro-topography of interlocking quartz crystals. The surface now displays sharp,
    well-defined grain boundaries and open micro-fissures, restoring its natural translucency.
    The laser process has eliminated all foreign material without inducing thermal
    cracking or altering the underlying crystalline structure.
