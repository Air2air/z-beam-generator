caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the onyx surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous film, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, adheres to the
    substrate. This layer consists of particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot
    and mineral dust, embedded within a matrix of hygroscopic salts and organic residues.
    The contaminants fill the natural micro-fissures and pores of the stone, creating
    a topographically uneven surface that masks the underlying crystalline structure.
    This layer significantly increases light scattering, reducing the stone's inherent
    translucency and creating a dull, matte appearance.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the complete restoration
    of the pristine onyx substrate. The contamination layer has been entirely removed
    via selective laser ablation, exposing the intact, polycrystalline surface. The
    characteristic interlocking quartz crystals, with a hardness of 7.0 Mohs, are
    now clearly visible, displaying sharp boundaries and minimal subsurface damage.
    The removal of light-scattering contaminants restores the stone's optical clarity
    and natural translucency at a microscopic scale, resulting in a surface that is
    both chemically and physically stable.
