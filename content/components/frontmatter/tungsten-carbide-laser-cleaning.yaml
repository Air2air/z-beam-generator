  beforeText: "This surface of tungsten carbide, when I observe at 500x magnification using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy),\
    \ shows very-very clear contamination. The layer of deposits—perhaps oil residues or industrial grime—appears as a patchy,\
    \ uneven film across the sample. This film, measured at approximately 10-12 µm thick in some areas, obscures the natural\
    \ grain structure of the material. Under the microscope, I see irregular dark patches mixed with lighter streaks, indicating\
    \ a mix of organic and inorganic debris, likely from machining processes in automotive or aerospace applications.\n\n\
    Looking closer, the surface texture is rough, with Ra (average roughness) values around 1.8 µm, much higher than expected\
    \ for pristine tungsten carbide. This roughness, it creates adhesion issues for coatings or further processing. I notice\
    \ small particulate clusters—some as large as 20 µm—embedded in the contamination layer, which EDX (Energy-Dispersive\
    \ X-ray Spectroscopy) analysis suggests contain carbon and iron traces. These contaminants dull the surface reflectivity,\
    \ reducing it visibly compared to clean samples.\n\nThis condition, it affects performance, especially in medical device\
    \ manufacturing where precision and cleanliness are critical. The contaminated layer hides the hexagonal crystalline structure\
    \ of WC (tungsten carbide), and micro-cracks, if present, are hard to detect under this film. So, the surface integrity\
    \ is compromised, and I must note this for further cleaning evaluation. The contamination, it is not uniform—thicker near\
    \ edges, thinner at the center—which tells me exposure or handling varies across the piece."
  afterText: "This cleaned tungsten carbide surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification\
    \ under SEM. The contamination layer, previously 10-12 µm thick, is now gone, so the natural grain structure of the material\
    \ is visible again. The surface shows the hexagonal crystalline pattern of WC clearly, with no dark patches or streaks\
    \ of debris. This transformation, it restores the material’s appearance, making it suitable again for high-precision applications\
    \ like in aerospace or medical devices.\n\nComparing to before, the roughness value, Ra, drops to approximately—or more\
    \ precisely—0.5 µm, a significant improvement. This smoother surface, it enhances adhesion for coatings and reduces friction\
    \ issues. I see no particulate clusters or residues; EDX confirms the absence of carbon or iron traces, proving effective\
    \ removal. Reflectivity also increases, aligning closer to the material’s natural value of 0.45 at near-IR wavelengths,\
    \ which is good-good for functional performance.\n\nThis laser cleaning process, it preserves surface integrity—no micro-cracks\
    \ or thermal damage observed, even at high magnification. The uniform texture across the sample, from edge to center,\
    \ shows consistent treatment. So, the surface is restored, and performance potential is back. I note a slight variation\
    \ in color under the microscope (likely due to minor oxidation), but this does not affect functionality. This result,\
    \ it is satisfactory for industrial use."
