        research_basis: Tungsten carbide (WC-Co) has excellent corrosion resistance
          in neutral and alkaline environments and good resistance to many acids,
          though it is susceptible to corrosion in oxidizing acids due to the cobalt
          binder. It is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, seawater, and many
          industrial chemicals, placing it well above most metals but below some monolithic
          ceramics and noble metals.

        research_basis: Tungsten carbide (WC) has poor oxidation resistance in air
          and begins to oxidize significantly at temperatures of 500-600°C, forming
          tungsten trioxide (WO₃). The value of 600°C is consistently cited in materials
          handbooks as the upper limit for continuous service in an oxidizing environment
          before rapid, destructive oxidation occurs.
