    description: Tungsten carbide (WC), a cemented carbide or cermet, exhibits exceptionally
      high compressive strength due to its composite structure of hard, covalent WC
      grains embedded in a tough, metallic cobalt binder. This structure enables it
      to withstand immense compressive loads without fracturing, making it superior
      to most engineering ceramics and metals.

    description: Fracture toughness (K_IC) represents tungsten carbide's resistance
      to crack propagation. WC-Co composites exhibit higher toughness than most ceramics
      due to crack bridging and plastic deformation in the cobalt binder phase. The
      toughness increases with cobalt content and is strongly influenced by WC grain
      size and distribution.
