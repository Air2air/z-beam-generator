caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the tungsten carbide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of agglomerated carbonaceous soot and fine metallic oxides, creating a matte,
    textured topography that masks the underlying material''s structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern,
    with some areas exhibiting thicker, crust-like deposits.


    The inherent micro-cracks and grain boundaries of the tungsten carbide substrate are completely filled with this particulate
    matter. This occludes the material''s characteristic fine-grained, granular structure, which typically reveals the hard
    WC grains and the tougher cobalt binder phase. The surface appears predominantly dark gray with intermittent regions of
    reddish-brown from iron oxide contamination.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The matte, textured
    contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying microstructure of the tungsten carbide
    composite. The fine, 1.5-micrometer WC grains and the intergranular cobalt binder network are now fully exposed and clearly
    defined.


    The laser process has effectively ablated the contaminants from the micro-cracks and grain boundaries without inducing
    thermal damage to the substrate. This is evident from the sharp, well-defined edges of the WC grains and the absence of
    micro-fracturing or surface melting. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly due to the exposure of the native,
    polished ceramic-metal composite.


    The result is a clean, topographically complex surface where the contrast between the hard, angular carbide grains and
    the ductile cobalt matrix is visually distinct. This level of cleanliness, achieved without mechanical abrasion, restores
    the material''s intrinsic surface properties, which is critical for subsequent coating adhesion or precise dimensional
    measurement.'
