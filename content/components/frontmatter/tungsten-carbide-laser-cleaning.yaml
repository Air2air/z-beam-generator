caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists
    of amorphous carbon deposits, embedded metallic particles, and oxide scales, which
    mask the underlying material's fine-grained microstructure. The surface texture
    appears matte and irregular, with contamination filling the natural micro-pores
    and valleys of the substrate, creating a topographically muted profile.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic, fine-grained
    microstructure of the tungsten carbide. The contamination layer is entirely removed,
    exposing a clean, well-defined grain boundary network and the characteristic hexagonal
    crystalline facets. The surface texture is restored to its original state, exhibiting
    sharp topographic features and micro-pores free of foreign material.


    The visual transformation is significant; the matte, obscured surface is replaced
    by a distinct, high-contrast micro-topography. The process effectively eliminates
    surface oxides and embedded particles without sub-surface damage, as confirmed
    by the integrity of the hard, brittle WC grains and the cobalt binder phase. This
    results in a surface with restored dimensional fidelity and optimized characteristics
    for subsequent coating adhesion or performance in service.'
