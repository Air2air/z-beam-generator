caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cherry wood surface is obscured by a heterogeneous
    contamination layer, typically 10-50 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, oxidized oil residues, and microbial biofilms that fill the
    porous wood structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous crust, masking the
    wood's natural grain and cell structure. The surface texture appears irregular
    and matte, with a roughness (Ra) increased to an estimated 8-12 µm due to the
    uneven deposition. The open pores of the cherry, which constitute approximately
    45% of the surface area, are fully occluded, compromising the substrate's integrity
    and appearance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration
    of the cherry wood's intrinsic surface morphology. The contamination layer has
    been selectively ablated, exposing the clean, open cell lumens and distinct anatomical
    features like vessels and rays. The original surface roughness of approximately
    3.2 µm Ra is restored, confirming the precise, non-contact nature of the laser
    ablation process. The wood's natural, porous microstructure is now fully visible
    and unobstructed, with no residual charring or heat-affected zone, indicating
    optimal laser parameters were used to remove contaminants without exceeding the
    material's pyrolysis threshold of 380°C.
