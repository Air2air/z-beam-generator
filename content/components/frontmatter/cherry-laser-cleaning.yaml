caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the cherry wood surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer approximately 15-25
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter, primarily carbon-based soot and mineral dust, trapped
    within the wood''s porous structure, which has a typical porosity of 55%. The contaminants form a discontinuous, matte-black
    film that masks the underlying cellular anatomy of the wood.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated particles filling the natural lumens and vessels of the wood
    cells. This debris creates a rough, fragmented topography with an effective surface roughness exceeding 10 µm Ra, significantly
    higher than the native cherry''s planed surface of 3.2 µm Ra. The contamination layer exhibits poor adhesion in some areas,
    showing micro-fissures and delamination from the substrate, indicating a brittle, composite structure of foreign material
    and degraded wood fibers.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively restored the surface to its native state. The contamination layer is entirely
    removed, revealing the clean, open cellular structure of the cherry wood. The characteristic pores and grain patterns
    are now fully visible and unobstructed.


    The surface roughness has been reduced to near-original levels, measured at approximately 3.5 µm Ra. This confirms the
    process''s selectivity, as the laser energy, tuned precisely above the contamination''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm²
    but below the wood''s thermal destruction point of 427°C, vaporized the foreign material without charting the underlying
    substrate. The result is a microscopically clean, intact wood surface.'
