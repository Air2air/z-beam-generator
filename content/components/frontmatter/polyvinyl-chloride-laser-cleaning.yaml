        research_basis: PVC is widely documented as having excellent resistance to
          a broad range of chemicals, including acids, alkalis, and salts, making
          it a standard material for corrosion-resistant piping and fittings. Its
          primary weakness is limited resistance to certain solvents and aromatic
          hydrocarbons, preventing a perfect score.

        research_basis: UL standards list PVC's maximum continuous service temperature
          in air as 60-75°C, with 60°C being the conservative rating for general purpose
          PVC formulations. PVC begins significant thermal degradation and oxidation
          around this temperature range, releasing hydrogen chloride.

        research_basis: MatWeb, a widely recognized database of material properties
          used in engineering, reports a typical flexural strength range of 80-110
          MPa for rigid, unfilled PVC. The lower end of this range (80 MPa) is a conservative
          and commonly cited value for general-purpose material. This property is
          typically determined by standardized 3-point bend test methods such as ASTM
          D790.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of Polyvinyl Chloride is highly dependent
          on its formulation (rigid vs. flexible). For rigid PVC, which aligns with
          the provided high hardness (83 Shore D), authoritative engineering handbooks
          and material databases (ASM, MatWeb) consistently report compressive yield
          strength values in the range of 50-80 MPa. The value of 55 MPa is a conservative
          and commonly cited figure for general-purpose rigid PVC under standard test
          conditions (room temperature, 23°C).

        research_basis: PVC's fracture toughness (K_IC) varies significantly with
          formulation (rigid vs. plasticized), molecular weight, and processing. Rigid
          PVC (uPVC) typically ranges from 2.0-4.0 MPa·√m at room temperature, with
          most engineering references clustering around 2.5-3.5 MPa·√m. The provided
          high hardness (83 Shore D) confirms this is rigid PVC, placing it in the
          upper portion of this range.
