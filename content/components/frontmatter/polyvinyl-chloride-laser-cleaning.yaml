subtitle: PVC has a lower heat tolerance and can release harmful chlorine gas when
  overheated. This requires careful control of laser settings to avoid melting and
  ensure safe fume extraction.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the PVC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 5-20 µm in thickness. This layer consists
    of embedded particulate matter, organic residues, and a discontinuous film that
    disrupts the substrate's inherent micro-texture. The contaminants exhibit poor
    adhesion, forming crack networks and creating shadowed voids where further degradation
    can initiate. The underlying PVC morphology is largely invisible, with only occasional
    topographic features hinting at the intact polymer beneath the occluding film.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native PVC surface, revealing its characteristic
    micro-texture with high fidelity. The contaminant layer is entirely removed, eliminating
    shadowed voids and exposing a continuous, uniform substrate. The surface now displays
    minimal laser interaction, confirming the process operated effectively below the
    material's 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold.
