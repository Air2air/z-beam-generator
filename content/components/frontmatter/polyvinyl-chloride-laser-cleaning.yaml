caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) surface is obscured
    by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers
    in thickness, consists of embedded particulate matter, organic residues, and a
    discontinuous film that masks the substrate''s inherent texture. The contaminants
    exhibit an irregular, agglomerated pattern, filling the microscopic valleys of
    the PVC''s original surface morphology. This layer significantly increases surface
    roughness and creates a diffuse, matte appearance under the microscope, which
    correlates to reduced surface energy and poor adhesion characteristics.


    The underlying PVC substrate shows no visible thermal degradation at this stage.
    However, the contamination creates a physical barrier that alters the surface''s
    thermal and optical properties. The foreign material has a higher and more variable
    absorption coefficient than the base PVC, making it susceptible to uneven heating.
    The presence of this layer poses a risk for subsequent manufacturing processes,
    such as bonding or coating, where a pristine, chemically defined surface is required.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. At 500x
    magnification, the contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the true
    micro-texture of the PVC substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-finish
    topography characteristic of the virgin polymer, with minor, sub-micrometer machining
    marks visible. The removal process has not induced melting or flow lines, indicating
    precise ablation at or below the material''s damage threshold.


    The visual transformation is significant. The diffuse, obscured appearance has
    been replaced by a consistent and predictable surface. The reflectivity has increased
    to the intrinsic value for PVC (~12% at 1064 nm), and the root mean square (RMS)
    roughness has been reduced to the baseline of the polymer itself. This pristine
    surface now presents optimal conditions for adhesion in subsequent manufacturing
    steps.'
