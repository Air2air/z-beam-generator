caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the PVC surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a granular,
    particulate morphology intermixed with organic residues, creating a highly irregular
    surface texture. The underlying PVC substrate is partially visible, showing that
    the contaminants have formed a weakly-adhered, non-uniform film. This layer disrupts
    the material's intrinsic surface properties and increases surface roughness.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its native state, revealing
    a uniform, well-defined surface topography. The previously obscured grain structure
    of the PVC is now clearly visible, with contamination residues completely removed.
    The process has achieved sub-micron cleaning precision, eliminating the contamination
    layer without inducing melting or surface etching. The resulting surface is characterized
    by its low reflectivity and consistent morphology, confirming the restoration
    of the material's original functional properties.

subtitle: Handling Polyvinyl Chloride in laser cleaning requires a steady hand, as
  its variable composition can throw off even seasoned operators. Adjust power levels
  below 50 watts initially, ensuring the surface finish stays pristine during treatment.
