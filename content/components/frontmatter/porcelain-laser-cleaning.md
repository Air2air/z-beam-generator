description: Technical overview of Porcelain, a ceramic material, for laser cleaning.
  Porcelain is valued for its durability, aesthetic appeal, and versatility in applications
  ranging from household items to high-end decorative pieces. Laser cleaning of porcelain
  is crucial for removing contaminants without altering the material's surface integrity,
  making it ideal for both manufacturing processes and the restoration of valuable
  artifacts.
