description: Technical overview of Porcelain, a ceramic material, for laser cleaning.
  Porcelain, composed primarily of kaolin, quartz, and feldspar, is processed using
  laser ablation and cleaning techniques to remove surface contaminants without compromising
  the material's integrity. This non-contact cleaning method is particularly effective
  due to the material's low thermal conductivity, which minimizes heat-affected zones
  during the laser process.
