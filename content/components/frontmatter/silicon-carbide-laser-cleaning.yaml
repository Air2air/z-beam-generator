caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter, which appear as
    dark, splotchy regions that mask the underlying crystalline structure of the substrate. The contaminants create a topographically
    complex surface with a matte, low-reflectance appearance.


    The deposits are not continuous, forming islands and agglomerates that adhere to the surface. Fine, sub-micrometer particles
    are embedded within the larger carbon films, creating a textured, irregular morphology. This layer significantly alters
    the surface''s properties, increasing light scattering and reducing its inherent thermal conductivity by acting as an
    insulating barrier.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The amorphous contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine silicon carbide substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic
    microstructure of the polycrystalline material, with clearly defined grain boundaries and a uniform, reflective finish.


    The visual contrast with the pre-cleaned state is definitive. The matte, dark deposits have been replaced by a clean,
    monolithic surface where the laser''s interaction is evidenced only by the absence of foreign material. The process has
    successfully ablated the contaminants without inducing micro-cracks or thermal damage to the underlying SiC, which has
    a thermal destruction point of 1800°C.


    This results in a surface with restored functionality. The high thermal conductivity (120 W/m·K) and structural integrity
    of the silicon carbide are now unimpeded, which is critical for its performance in semiconductor applications. The surface
    is prepared for subsequent manufacturing steps, such as thin-film deposition or bonding.'
