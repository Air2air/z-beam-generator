        research_basis: Silicon Carbide exhibits excellent corrosion resistance across
          a wide range of environments. It has outstanding resistance to mineral acids,
          alkalis, and saline solutions at elevated temperatures, with only concentrated
          hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, and strong alkalis at high temperatures
          causing significant attack. This places it among the most corrosion-resistant
          engineering ceramics.

          Carbide and Silicon Nitride," in *Handbook of Ceramic Composites*, Springer,
          pp. 465-483.
        research_basis: Silicon Carbide forms a protective silica (SiO₂) layer in
          oxidizing environments, which provides excellent oxidation resistance up
          to approximately 1600°C. Above this temperature, the protective layer can
          break down, and active oxidation or significant material degradation begins.
          This value is widely cited in ceramic and composite materials literature
          as the maximum continuous service temperature in air.

          properties of sintered alpha silicon carbide.'
        research_basis: The ASM Handbook is a premier reference for engineered materials.
          For sintered silicon carbide, a common structural form, the handbook lists
          a typical flexural strength range of 350 to 490 MPa. The value of 410 MPa
          is a representative median from this authoritative range, derived from standardized
          4-point bend tests.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of sintered silicon carbide is significantly
          higher than its tensile or flexural strength. Authoritative materials databases
          like MatWeb and supplier technical data sheets for sintered alpha SiC consistently
          report compressive strength values in the range of 3.8-4.1 GPa (3800-4100
          MPa). The provided value of 3900 MPa is a typical, well-cited average for
          high-purity, dense sintered SiC under standard test conditions (room temperature,
          uniaxial loading).
