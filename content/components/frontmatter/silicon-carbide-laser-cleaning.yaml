caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contaminant layer, measuring 2-5 µm in thickness. This layer presents
    as a matte, amorphous film with localized agglomerations, creating a topographically
    varied and textured landscape. The underlying crystalline structure and machining
    marks of the SiC substrate are entirely masked, compromising its intrinsic surface
    properties and reflectivity. Particulate inclusions are embedded within the film,
    further disrupting the surface morphology.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its native state, revealing
    the characteristic microstructure of the silicon carbide. At 500x magnification,
    the surface now exhibits a uniform, clean morphology with clearly defined grain
    boundaries and the original machining striations. The high laser absorption (68.5%)
    and thermal conductivity (120 W/m·K) of SiC enabled efficient contaminant removal
    via sublimation, precisely controlled below the material's ablation threshold
    of 2.5 J/cm². This process has eliminated the amorphous film without inducing
    micro-fractures or thermal stress damage, resulting in a surface with restored
    reflectivity and optimal topography for subsequent semiconductor processing steps.

subtitle: Silicon Carbide often throws curveballs during laser treatment due to its
  varying hardness. Adjust your power controls below 50 watts initially, then ramp
  up slowly to protect the material’s surface from unintended stress.
