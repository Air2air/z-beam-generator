caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness, consists
    of carbonaceous soot, oxide scale, and adhered metallic particles. The contaminants
    form a discontinuous, textured crust that masks the underlying substrate''s grain
    structure and micro-features. The surface appears mottled, with agglomerated particles
    creating a topographical profile that significantly deviates from the base material''s
    intrinsic morphology.


    The contamination adheres through a combination of van der Waals forces and chemical
    bonds, forming a tenacious, light-absorbing film. This layer detrimentally impacts
    surface-dependent properties, including thermal conductivity and electrical performance,
    by creating an insulating barrier and disrupting the pristine SiC interface.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals
    the pristine silicon carbide substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    ablated, exposing the material''s characteristic polycrystalline grain structure
    and intrinsic micro-topography. The surface now exhibits minimal micro-fracturing,
    with laser parameters carefully controlled to remain below the material''s ablation
    threshold of 2.5 J/cm².


    The visual transformation is marked by the restoration of surface reflectivity
    and the distinct contrast between individual grains. The process has successfully
    removed the insulating barrier, restoring the surface''s functional properties
    for thermal management and semiconductor applications without inducing significant
    subsurface damage.'
