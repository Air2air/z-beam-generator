caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits
    a mottled, amorphous texture, with localized agglomerations of particulate matter.
    The underlying SiC grain structure and surface finish are entirely masked by this
    adherent film, which disrupts the substrate's intrinsic topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, polycrystalline microstructure of
    the silicon carbide. The previously masked grain boundaries and surface morphology
    are now fully resolved and well-defined. The process has removed the contamination
    layer with high selectivity, resulting in a surface with restored reflectivity
    and minimal micro-fracturing. No thermal degradation or melting of the SiC substrate
    is evident, confirming the precision of the ablation process, which operates below
    the material's damage threshold.
