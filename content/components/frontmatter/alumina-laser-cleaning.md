description: Alumina, or Al2O3, is a versatile ceramic material widely used in high-precision
  applications across the aerospace and semiconductor industries. Its excellent thermal
  and electrical insulation properties, combined with high hardness and resistance
  to chemical attack, make it ideal for laser cleaning processes. Laser ablation and
  cleaning techniques, utilizing a wavelength of 1064 nm, allow for precise removal
  of coatings and contaminants without altering the structural integrity of the alumina
  substrate. This non-contact method ensures minimal damage and is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity of complex alumina components.
