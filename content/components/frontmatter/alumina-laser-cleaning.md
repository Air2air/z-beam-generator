headline: "Comprehensive technical guide for laser cleaning ceramic alumina"
description: ""Laser cleaning of alumina ceramic utilizes high-intensity pulsed laser" radiation, primarily at 1064 nm, for the non-contact removal of surface contaminants
   and coatings. The process relies on the high thermal shock resistance and melting
   point of Al2Ou2083, allowing for precise ablation of contaminants with minimal
   thermal impact on the substrate when optimal parameters are used.\"
