description: Alumina, with the chemical formula Al2O3, is a ceramic material widely
  used in industries such as aerospace and semiconductors due to its exceptional hardness
  and thermal stability. Laser cleaning of alumina involves the use of precise laser
  parameters to remove surface contaminants and coatings without damaging the underlying
  material. This process leverages the high melting point and chemical inertness of
  alumina, allowing for effective non-contact cleaning that preserves the integrity
  and functionality of alumina components.
