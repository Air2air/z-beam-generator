description: Alumina, with the chemical formula Al2O3, is a highly durable ceramic
  material widely used in industries such as aerospace and semiconductors for its
  excellent thermal and mechanical properties. Laser cleaning of alumina involves
  the use of high-intensity laser pulses to remove surface contaminants and coatings
  without damaging the underlying material. This non-contact cleaning method is particularly
  effective due to alumina's high melting point and resistance to thermal shock, ensuring
  that the material's integrity and performance are maintained after cleaning.
