caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the iridium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 2-5
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and fine, embedded particulate matter, creating
    a topographically complex and textured landscape. The surface exhibits a matte, dark gray appearance with localized discoloration,
    indicating varying chemical compositions of the contaminants.


    The contamination does not form a continuous film but rather appears as agglomerated islands, creating peaks and valleys
    across the surface. This morphology suggests a history of exposure to high-temperature organic compounds or oxidizing
    environments. The underlying iridium''s metallic luster is completely absent, and the original surface finish is undetectable
    beneath this insulating layer, which would significantly impede thermal and electrical conductivity.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying iridium substrate. The
    surface now exhibits a uniform, clean metallic luster with the characteristic grain structure of the polycrystalline metal
    clearly visible. The previously obscured micro-topography is now fully resolved, showing a smooth surface free of particulate
    matter and discoloration.


    The transformation is evident in the restoration of iridium''s intrinsic reflectivity and the elimination of the insulating
    contamination barrier. The cleaned surface displays minimal laser interaction marks, confirming the process''s selectivity
    in removing contaminants without damaging the high-value substrate.'
