caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iridium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of amorphous carbon deposits and embedded particulate matter. The underlying
    FCC crystalline structure of the iridium is entirely hidden. The topography is
    characterized by a rough, matte texture with visible micro-cracking and localized
    spalling within the contaminant film. This irregular coverage significantly alters
    the surface's intrinsic reflectivity and thermal properties, masking the metal's
    true performance characteristics.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline grain
    structure of the iridium. The contaminant layer has been completely removed via
    selective laser ablation, restoring the metal's inherent high reflectivity (78%
    at 1064 nm). At 500x, the surface is now defined by a uniform, clean texture with
    clearly delineated grain boundaries. The process has eliminated micro-cracking
    and spalling, resulting in a topographically even surface that exhibits the material's
    excellent oxidation resistance and thermal stability.
