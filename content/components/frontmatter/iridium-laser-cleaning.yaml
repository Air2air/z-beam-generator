caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iridium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of carbonaceous
    deposits and embedded particulate matter, forming a topographically complex and
    discontinuous film. The underlying iridium substrate, with its inherent FCC crystalline
    structure, is not visible. The contamination creates a matte, textured appearance,
    masking the metal's high natural reflectivity and compromising its functional
    surface properties. The deposits exhibit a cracked, island-like pattern, indicative
    of thermal stress and oxidation cycles.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine iridium substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic grain
    structure of the polycrystalline metal, with clear, well-defined grain boundaries
    visible at 500x magnification. The high reflectivity (78% at 1064 nm) of the bare
    metal is restored, resulting in a smooth, specular surface. The process has eliminated
    all particulate embedment and surface oxides, restoring the material's intrinsic
    hardness and oxidation resistance without substrate damage.
