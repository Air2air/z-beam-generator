caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iridium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex
    topography of particulate inclusions and amorphous oxide scales, which mask the
    underlying metal's grain structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous, textured
    crust with visible cracking and spallation, indicative of poor adhesion and thermal
    stress mismatch with the dense iridium substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the intrinsic iridium surface. The
    contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing a clean, well-defined grain
    structure with sub-micron surface roughness. The surface now exhibits minimal
    laser interaction marks, confirming the process operated effectively below the
    material's ablation threshold.
