description: Technical overview of Float Glass, a type of glass manufactured by floating
  molten glass on a bed of molten metal, primarily tin, to achieve a uniform thickness
  and very flat surfaces. Float Glass is ideal for laser cleaning due to its smooth
  surface and non-porous nature, which allows for precise removal of contaminants
  without damaging the glass. The use of laser ablation at a wavelength of 1064nm
  and fluence between 0.5–5 J/cm² ensures efficient cleaning, maintaining the integrity
  and clarity of the glass for applications in automotive and architectural sectors.
