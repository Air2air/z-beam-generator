description: Laser cleaning of float glass utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying silica-based substrate. The process relies on the differential absorption of laser energy, where contaminants have a higher absorption coefficient than the transparent glass, enabling precise, non-contact removal without chemicals or abrasives.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Elimination of Chemical Solvents
  description: Removes need for volatile organic compound (VOC)-based solvents and acidic/alkaline cleaners, reducing hazardous waste generation by 100% for the cleaning process itself.
- benefit: Reduced Water Consumption
  description: Eliminates water usage for rinsing, saving an estimated 5–10 liters of water per square meter of glass cleaned compared to traditional wet methods.
