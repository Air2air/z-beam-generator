        research_basis: Hastelloy C-276, a prominent grade within the Hastelloy family,
          is specifically engineered for exceptional corrosion resistance. According
          to the primary manufacturer Haynes International, it exhibits outstanding
          performance in a wide range of severe environments, including oxidizing
          and reducing media, and is highly resistant to pitting and stress-corrosion
          cracking. It is a benchmark material for chemical process industries. The
          rating is less than 10 due to susceptibility in extremely specific, highly
          oxidizing conditions.

        research_basis: Hastelloy X, a widely used nickel-chromium-iron-molybdenum
          alloy, is specified by its primary manufacturer for continuous service in
          air up to 1095°C (2000°F). This temperature represents the established upper
          limit before significant oxidation and material degradation occur, based
          on long-term industrial testing and data sheets from the authoritative material
          producer.

        research_basis: The provided material card lacks flexural strength. Hastelloy
          is a family of nickel-based superalloys, and its flexural strength is not
          a standard published property. For isotropic, ductile metals like Hastelloy,
          the flexural strength in a 3-point bend test is closely approximated by
          the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The authoritative datasheet from the
          primary manufacturer, Haynes International, lists the typical UTS for Hastelloy
          C-276 (a common grade) as 724 MPa, which serves as a valid and authoritative
          proxy for its bending strength.

        research_basis: Hastelloy is a family of nickel-based alloys, and compressive
          strength is not a primary published property as it typically closely approximates
          tensile strength for metals. The provided value is the typical tensile yield
          strength (0.2% offset) for Hastelloy C-276, the most common grade, from
          the primary manufacturer. For ductile metals like Hastelloy, compressive
          yield strength is generally considered equivalent to tensile yield strength
          for design purposes.
