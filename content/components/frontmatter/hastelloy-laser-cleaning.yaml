caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded oxides, carbonaceous soot, and salt deposits, which form a topographically complex crust. The underlying FCC grain structure is entirely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, a result of differential thermal expansion and contraction cycles. This porous layer significantly increases surface roughness and creates sites for pitting and stress corrosion cracking initiation. The native metallic luster and machining marks of the Hastelloy substrate are completely absent beneath this insulative and often chemically active scale.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate's integrity. The surface now reveals the fine, equiaxed grain structure of the FCC matrix, with machining marks and minor pitting clearly visible. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, resulting in a clean, metallurgically pure surface with minimal topographical alteration to the base metal.
