caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated rubber surface shows a discontinuous layer of carbonaceous soot and
    embedded silica particles, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer obscures the rubber''s original molded texture,
    creating a rough, matte topography.


    The contamination is not uniform; it forms agglomerated islands that adhere to the polymer chains on the surface. Fine
    particulate matter, typically 2-5 micrometers in diameter, is scattered across the surface and embedded within the soot
    matrix. This composite layer significantly increases the surface roughness, measured at over 10 µm Ra, and masks the underlying
    material''s properties.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the rubber''s intrinsic surface texture
    with a measured roughness of 2.5 µm Ra. The underlying molded surface pattern is now fully visible and undamaged.


    The process has eliminated all particulate matter and soot residues, restoring the material''s original, consistent topography.
    No thermal degradation or surface melting is observed, confirming the laser parameters were precisely controlled to ablate
    only the contaminants.'
