caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rubber surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of embedded carbonaceous soot, oxidized polymer chains, and particulate matter. The contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying rubber's texture, filling the natural micro-fissures and valleys. The surface morphology is highly irregular, with agglomerated particles creating a topographically rough and uneven profile. This layer significantly alters the surface's properties, increasing its roughness and reducing its effective coefficient of friction. The original elastomeric matrix is no longer visible, as the contaminants have created a brittle, composite crust on the compliant substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native elastomeric state. At 500x magnification, the contaminant crust is entirely absent, revealing the rubber's intrinsic micro-texture of interconnected fibrils and shallow pores. The surface is now uniform and continuous, with no evidence of thermal damage or ablation of the base material. The removal of the particulate-filled layer has re-established the material's original surface energy and topography. This results in a clean, chemically active surface that is optimal for subsequent processes like bonding or coating, with the rubber's fundamental viscoelastic properties fully preserved.
