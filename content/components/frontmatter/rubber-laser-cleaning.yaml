        research_basis: Rubber (particularly general-purpose elastomers like Nitrile,
          EPDM) exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range of environmental factors
          including water, ozone, and weathering. It is highly resistant to galvanic
          corrosion and many dilute chemicals, though resistance varies by specific
          rubber type and can be degraded by oils, strong oxidizers, and prolonged
          UV exposure. The high rating reflects its general superior performance against
          atmospheric and aqueous corrosion compared to metals.

        research_basis: General-purpose rubber materials (like natural rubber or SBR)
          typically have a maximum continuous service temperature in air in the range
          of 80-100°C before significant oxidative degradation begins. The provided
          hardness (60 Shore A) is consistent with these common, non-specialty elastomers,
          which have limited heat resistance.

        research_basis: The flexural strength of rubber is highly dependent on its
          specific formulation and hardness. For a general-purpose rubber with a hardness
          of 60 Shore A, a typical flexural strength value is in the range of 3-7
          MPa. The provided value of 5.0 MPa is a representative median for this hardness
          level, as cited by materials science databases and engineering handbooks.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of rubber is not a single fixed value
          but is highly dependent on its hardness (provided as 60 Shore A). For a
          60 Shore A elastomer, typical compressive strength ranges from 15-25 MPa.
          The value of 20 MPa represents a standard mid-range value for this hardness
          under standard test conditions (ASTM D575, room temperature).
