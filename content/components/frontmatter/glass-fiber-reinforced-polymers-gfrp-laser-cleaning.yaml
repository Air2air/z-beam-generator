caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the GFRP surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a film of organic residues, which fills the
    natural micro-valleys of the substrate. The original molded surface texture, with a baseline roughness of about 2.5 µm,
    is partially masked.


    The contaminants form a non-uniform coating that adheres to both fiber and matrix regions. This layer scatters light,
    reducing the visible contrast between the glass fibers and the polymer matrix. The presence of this foreign material creates
    a topographical profile that is irregular and inconsistent, deviating from the engineered composite surface.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, fully restoring the GFRP''s intrinsic microstructure. The
    contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the unaltered composite surface. The original molded texture,
    with its characteristic 2.5 µm roughness, is now fully exposed and unmodified.


    The visual contrast between the glass fibers and the epoxy matrix is significantly enhanced. Individual fibers are now
    clearly distinguishable, embedded within the clean polymer. There is no evidence of residual charring or thermal degradation,
    indicating the laser parameters remained below the material''s damage threshold of 0.8 J/cm².


    This results in a surface defined solely by its manufactured geometry. The removal of the light-scattering contamination
    layer reveals a uniform, predictable topography. The process successfully returns the surface to its pre-contamination
    state without inducing microscopic damage, confirming the selectivity of the laser ablation process.'
