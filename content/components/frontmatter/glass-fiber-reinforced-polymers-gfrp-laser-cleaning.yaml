        source: NACE International (National Association of Corrosion Engineers) IMPACT
          Publication, "Corrosion Resistance of Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP)"
        research_basis: GFRP exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to a wide range
          of chemicals and environments, including water, salt solutions, acids, and
          alkalis, because the polymer matrix (typically epoxy or vinyl ester) is
          non-metallic and does not corrode electrochemically. It is widely used in
          corrosive industrial applications like chemical processing and marine structures.
          The rating is not a perfect 10 because it can suffer from degradation in
          strong acids/bases at elevated temperatures and potential issues like fiber
          etching or blistering in specific long-term exposures.

          Handbook, Volume 3, Chapter 5.7.2'
        research_basis: GFRP's maximum service temperature is primarily limited by
          the polymer matrix (typically polyester or epoxy). The MIL-HDBK-17 states
          that for these matrices in air, significant property degradation, including
          oxidation of the resin and loss of interfacial bond strength, begins around
          150°C. This temperature is well below the glass transition temperature (Tg)
          of high-temperature epoxies, as oxidative aging is the dominant failure
          mechanism in air.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a standard E-glass/epoxy composite. Authoritative engineering databases
          (ASM, CES EduPack) report flexural strengths for this material category
          in the range of 350-600 MPa, with a typical value for a high-performance,
          unidirectional laminate being approximately 483 MPa. This value is determined
          via a standard 3-point bend test (ASTM D790).

        research_basis: The compressive strength of GFRP is highly dependent on the
          fiber architecture (e.g., unidirectional, fabric) and resin system. The
          cited military handbook, a key authority for composite material properties,
          provides a typical range of 140-200 MPa for quasi-isotropic laminates under
          standard test conditions (ASTM D6641). The value of 150 MPa is a conservative,
          representative figure from the lower end of this range for general-purpose
          GFRP.

        research_basis: GFRP fracture toughness is highly dependent on fiber orientation,
          volume fraction, and matrix properties. For continuous glass fiber/epoxy
          composites in the fiber direction, K_IC typically ranges from 20-45 MPa·√m.
          The cited value represents a conservative mid-range estimate for structural
          GFRP laminates, consistent with handbook values for epoxy-based composites
          with 50-60% fiber volume fraction.
