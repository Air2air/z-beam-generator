caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GFRP surface is obscured by a discontinuous contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded particulates and amorphous carbonaceous deposits, masks the underlying composite texture. The topography is irregular, with agglomerated soot particles filling the valleys between fiber bundles, creating a matte, non-reflective surface. This contamination layer disrupts the intended surface profile, increasing roughness to an estimated 4-5 µm Ra and compromising interfacial bonding potential.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively restores the native GFRP topography. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct, undulating texture of the glass fiber weave and polymer matrix. Individual fibers are now clearly visible, with surface roughness returning to its intrinsic 1.2 µm Ra. The interface between fibers and matrix is sharply defined, free of residual debris. This exposes the original, slightly textured composite surface, which exhibits a uniform, clean appearance ideal for subsequent processing or adhesion.
