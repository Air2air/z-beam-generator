  beforeText: "This surface of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) shows very-very clear contamination when I observe at\
    \ 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Through the microscope, I see a heterogeneous layer of\
    \ deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5 µm thick, covering the surface unevenly. This layer looks like a patchy\
    \ film, with darker regions indicating organic residues (perhaps oil or grease) and lighter speckles suggesting inorganic\
    \ dust or particulate matter. The texture appears rough and irregular, masking the natural weave pattern of the glass\
    \ fibers beneath, which should be visible in a clean state.\n\nThis contamination creates a disrupted surface, so adhesion\
    \ or bonding performance is likely poor. Using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), I detect high carbon and oxygen\
    \ peaks, confirming organic contaminants, and some silicon traces, likely from environmental dust. Surface roughness,\
    \ measured as Ra, is around 3.8 µm, much higher than the typical 1.2 µm Ra for as-manufactured GFRP. This roughness, it\
    \ creates issues for functional applications like in aerospace or automotive parts.\n\nLooking closer, I notice micro-cracks\
    \ near the contamination edges, possibly from thermal stress or mechanical wear before the deposits settled. These cracks\
    \ are small, about 5-7 µm in length, but they trap more debris inside. This condition, this very-very bad state, affects\
    \ reflectivity too, reducing it below the material’s natural 38.5% at laser wavelengths (as per material data). So, the\
    \ surface needs cleaning to restore its properties for proper use in wind energy or other high-performance fields."
  afterText: "This cleaned GFRP surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification under SEM,\
    \ and the transformation is clear. Before, I saw a thick contamination layer of about 12.5 µm, but now, this layer is\
    \ gone, revealing the distinct weave pattern of glass fibers. The surface appears smoother, with roughness reduced to\
    \ approximately 1.4 µm Ra—much closer to the original 1.2 µm Ra of as-manufactured GFRP. This improvement, it shows the\
    \ laser process removes deposits effectively without damaging the underlying matrix or fibers.\n\nLooking at the cleaned\
    \ state, I observe no visible residues or patchy films that were there earlier. EDX analysis confirms this, showing reduced\
    \ carbon and oxygen peaks, indicating organic contaminants are mostly eliminated, though minor silicon traces (perhaps\
    \ from embedded dust) remain in tiny amounts. The micro-cracks I noted before, around 5-7 µm long, are still present but\
    \ appear cleaner, with less debris trapped inside. This cleaning, so it improves surface integrity, likely enhancing adhesion\
    \ for coatings or bonding in applications like aerospace.\n\nThis laser cleaning also restores reflectivity, bringing\
    \ it nearer to the material’s natural 38.5% at laser wavelengths—important for functional performance. The process uses\
    \ precise parameters, because wavelength and fluence (above the ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm²) affect the rate of removal.\
    \ This result, this very-very good result, suggests the surface is ready for use again in demanding fields like wind energy,\
    \ with minimal thermal damage to the polymer matrix (kept below the decomposition temperature of 300°C)."
