description: Maple, a hardwood commonly used in furniture and woodworking, is ideal
  for laser cleaning due to its response to specific laser wavelengths and fluences.
  The process effectively removes surface contaminants and residues while preserving
  the integrity of the wood's surface. Laser cleaning of Maple involves non-contact
  ablation, which is crucial for the restoration of antique pieces and fine woodworking
  without damaging the material's inherent properties. The technical specifications
  involve using a 1064nm wavelength laser with a fluence range of 0.5-3.0 J/cm² to
  achieve optimal cleaning results.
