caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Silicon Germanium (SiGe) surface is obscured
    by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 0.5-2 µm thick. This layer consists
    of hydrocarbon deposits and adsorbed particulate matter, creating a textured,
    matte topography that scatters light. The underlying diamond cubic crystalline
    structure of the SiGe is entirely hidden. Contaminants form dendritic and island-like
    patterns, clustering along micro-scratches and grain boundaries, which compromises
    the electrical and optical performance of the semiconductor surface.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic properties of the SiGe.
    The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the pristine, uniform
    substrate. The surface is now smooth and reflective, with clearly defined grain
    boundaries and a consistent morphology. This restoration ensures optimal electrical
    contact and minimal signal loss for subsequent processing steps.

subtitle: Pay close attention to Silicon Germanium during laser treatment—its varying
  properties can throw you off if you’re not careful. Adjust the power levels very-very
  slowly to safeguard the layer and get good-good results every time.
