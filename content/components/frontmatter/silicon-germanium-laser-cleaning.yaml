  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Silicon Germanium surface is obscured by
    a non-uniform contamination layer. This film, measuring between 0.5 and 2 micrometers
    thick, consists of hydrocarbon deposits and particulate matter. The underlying
    diamond cubic crystal structure is masked, and the surface texture appears matte
    and irregular. Contaminants form dendritic and island-like patterns, disrupting
    the substrate's inherent reflectivity and creating potential sites for electrical
    failure.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the intrinsic surface morphology. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the uniform, crystalline grain structure
    of the SiGe substrate. The surface is now smooth and continuous, with a reflectivity
    of 0.42 at 1064 nm. This pristine state ensures optimal electrical contact and
    minimizes defect-related performance losses.
