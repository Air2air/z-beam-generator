caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Silicon Germanium surface is obscured by
    a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 0.5 to 3 micrometers
    in thickness, consists of particulate matter and a thin, amorphous film. The underlying
    diamond cubic lattice structure is completely hidden. The surface texture appears
    matte and irregular, with contamination concentrating along microscopic polishing
    lines and grain boundaries, creating a mottled, high-contrast pattern that severely
    scatters light and degrades electrical performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic surface. The contamination
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the uniform, polished substrate. The surface
    is now specular and continuous, with minimal light scattering. The original machining
    marks are visible but clean, indicating precise contaminant ablation without damage
    to the SiGe crystal.
