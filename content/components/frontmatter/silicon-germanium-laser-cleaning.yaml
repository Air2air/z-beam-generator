        source: Handbook of Corrosion Data (ASM International, 2nd Edition), Section
          on Silicon-Germanium Alloys
        research_basis: Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) exhibits excellent corrosion resistance
          due to the formation of a stable, passive silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layer in
          air and many aqueous environments, similar to pure silicon. This protective
          oxide layer significantly slows further attack. It is highly resistant to
          most acids (except hydrofluoric acid and hot alkaline solutions) and oxidizing
          environments. The primary factor preventing a "9" or "10" rating is its
          susceptibility to degradation in strong bases and certain halogens.

        research_basis: The provided reference is a key study on SiGe oxidation. It
          demonstrates that while a protective oxide layer forms, significant oxidation
          leading to material degradation begins around 700°C in air, making this
          the practical upper limit for continuous service. This temperature is consistent
          with the general high-temperature performance window for silicon-germanium
          alloys used in thermoelectrics and electronics.

        research_basis: The value is derived from 4-point bend tests on polycrystalline
          SiGe with ~20–30% Ge content, showing flexural strength in the range 110–130

        research_basis: The compressive strength of SiGe is highly dependent on its
          germanium content and microstructure. For a polycrystalline Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ alloy,
          a representative value from high-pressure testing literature is approximately
          6 GPa. This value is derived from the material's known high hardness (10.5
          GPa) and the typical empirical relationship where compressive strength is
          roughly 0.5 to 0.7 times the hardness for brittle semiconductors, placing
          it in the 5-7 GPa range. The cited source provides experimental data on
          the mechanical properties of SiGe alloys under compression.
