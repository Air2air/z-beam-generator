caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Silicon Germanium (Si₀.₇Ge₀.₃) surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring between 0.5 to 3 micrometers thick, consists of hydrocarbon deposits and adsorbed particulate matter. The underlying diamond cubic crystalline structure is completely masked. The contaminants form irregular, blotchy patterns that disrupt the substrate's inherent reflectivity of 38% at 1064nm. The surface texture appears matte and topographically complex, with the foreign material filling the native micro-roughness of the semiconductor.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface is transformed. The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine, homogeneous SiGe substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform texture with restored reflectivity. The intrinsic crystalline structure is clearly visible, confirming the successful ablation of all foreign material without damage to the underlying semiconductor.
