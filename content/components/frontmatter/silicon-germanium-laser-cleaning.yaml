caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon germanium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This
    layer, measuring approximately 2-5 micrometers thick, appears as a textured, amorphous film with visible particulate inclusions.
    The surface morphology is characterized by a matte, topographically varied finish that scatters light, significantly reducing
    reflectivity.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked-mudflat pattern, with fissures revealing the underlying substrate. Particulate contaminants,
    ranging from sub-micrometer to 10 micrometers in diameter, are embedded within the film. This layer disrupts the intrinsic
    crystalline structure of the SiGe, masking its characteristic semiconductor properties and creating a barrier that would
    impede electronic performance and subsequent manufacturing steps.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The amorphous contamination layer has been
    completely removed, revealing the underlying silicon germanium''s intrinsic crystalline structure. The surface now exhibits
    a uniform, smooth morphology with a consistent reflectivity characteristic of a pristine semiconductor.


    The previously obscured grain boundaries and the material''s natural texture are now clearly visible. All particulate
    inclusions and the cracked, matte film have been eliminated, leaving a clean substrate ideal for further processing. The
    surface is restored to its functional state without the microscopic damage that mechanical cleaning methods can cause.'
