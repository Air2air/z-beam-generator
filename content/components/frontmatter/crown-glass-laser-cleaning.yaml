caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the crown glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film, likely a mixture
    of organic residues and atmospheric dust. The surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated particles creating
    a topographical map of peaks and valleys that scatter light and disrupt the underlying glass''s clarity.


    The contamination adheres to the glass, filling the native micro-roughness of the polished surface, which has a baseline
    smoothness of 0.5 nm Ra. The particulates, ranging from 1 to 20 micrometers in diameter, are distributed in a patchy,
    non-cohesive pattern. This layer significantly increases light scattering and masks the intrinsic optical properties of
    the crown glass substrate, reducing light transmission and creating diffuse reflection points.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed, revealing the pristine, polished crown glass substrate. The surface now exhibits its inherent smoothness, with
    a measured roughness of 0.5 nm Ra, and is free of particulate matter and film residues.


    The laser process has restored optical clarity by eliminating the light-scattering contaminants. The surface is now continuous
    and homogeneous, allowing for unimpeded light transmission. The cleaning has achieved its objective of contaminant ablation
    without inducing micro-fractures or thermal damage to the underlying glass, as confirmed by the absence of new surface
    defects at this magnification.'
