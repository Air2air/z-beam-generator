        research_basis: Crown glass (soda-lime silica glass) exhibits excellent chemical
          resistance to most environments except hydrofluoric acid and strong alkalis.
          It maintains stability against water, atmospheric conditions, and most acids,
          with corrosion rates typically <0.1 µm/year in neutral pH environments.
          The 8/10 rating reflects minor vulnerability to alkaline solutions and stress
          corrosion cracking.

        research_basis: Crown glass, a soda-lime-silicate glass, does not oxidize
          in the traditional sense but softens and deforms. Its maximum continuous
          service temperature in air is limited by its annealing point (~500°C) and
          strain point (~470°C), above which viscous flow begins, constituting a "significant"
          property change. This 500°C limit is a standard upper-use temperature cited
          for this glass type in authoritative materials references.

          (ASM International, 1996)'
        research_basis: Crown glass, a common soda-lime-silica glass, has a typical
          flexural strength in the range of 50-90 MPa. The value of 70 MPa is a well-cited
          average for pristine, laboratory-tested specimens under short-term loading
          in a 3- or 4-point bend test. This strength is highly dependent on surface
          quality and test conditions, as flaws dramatically reduce the practical
          strength.

        research_basis: Crown glass, as a common soda-lime silicate glass, has a well-documented
          compressive strength that is significantly higher than its tensile strength.
          Authoritative engineering handbooks consistently report a compressive strength
          range of 500-2000 MPa for annealed soda-lime glass, with a typical or mean
          value around 1000-1100 MPa. The cited source provides a specific value within
          this established range for generic crown/soda-lime glass.
