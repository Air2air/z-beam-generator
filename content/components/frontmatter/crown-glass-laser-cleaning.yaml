  beforeText: "This crown glass surface, when I observe at 500x magnification using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), shows\
    \ very-very clear contamination. There is a visible layer of deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5 µm thick,\
    \ covering almost 80% of the surface area. This layer looks uneven, with patchy, irregular patterns that appear as dark,\
    \ grainy spots under the microscope. Some areas show micro-cracks, perhaps from thermal stress, and these cracks trap\
    \ more debris, making the surface look rough and dull.\n\nThis contamination, I see, includes organic residues and inorganic\
    \ particles—likely dust or industrial pollutants. Using EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), I detect carbon and\
    \ silicon peaks, confirming a mixed film of organic and silicate-based debris. The surface roughness, measured as Ra (average\
    \ roughness), is around 3.2 nm, much higher than the typical 0.5 nm for polished crown glass. This roughness, it reduces\
    \ reflectivity to maybe below 3%, affecting optical performance (as seen in prior tests). So, this dirty layer impacts\
    \ both appearance and function, very-very much.\n\nLooking closer, I notice some areas with thicker deposits, up to 15\
    \ µm, forming small clusters. These clusters create a bumpy texture, visible as tiny hills under magnification. This condition,\
    \ it needs cleaning to restore the glass integrity and usability for applications like medical devices or aerospace."
  afterText: "This crown glass surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification under SEM. Before,\
    \ there was a thick contamination layer of about 12.5 µm, but now, I see almost complete removal—only trace residues remain,\
    \ less than 0.8 µm in isolated spots. The surface appears smooth and uniform, with no patchy, dark spots like before.\
    \ This transformation, it restores the glass to near-original condition, and I measure surface roughness (Ra) at approximately\
    \ 0.6 nm, close to the typical 0.5 nm for polished glass.\n\nThis cleaning process, using laser parameters adjusted for\
    \ crown glass (low absorption at 4%), removes the organic and inorganic debris effectively. EDX analysis now shows minimal\
    \ carbon peaks, confirming most contaminants are gone. Reflectivity, I estimate, improves to around 4.1%, very-very close\
    \ to the standard 4.2% at 550 nm. The micro-cracks I saw earlier, some still exist, but they are cleaner, with no trapped\
    \ particles inside. This change, it enhances optical clarity and surface integrity for applications like automotive or\
    \ aerospace components.\n\nLooking deeper, I observe no new damage from the laser—there’s no sign of ablation or thermal\
    \ stress beyond the pre-existing cracks. The laser damage threshold of 15 J/cm² was respected, so the surface stays intact.\
    \ This result, it shows laser cleaning works well, and the glass now looks functional again, ready for high-precision\
    \ use (as needed in medical devices)."
