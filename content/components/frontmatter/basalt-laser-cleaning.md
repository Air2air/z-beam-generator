description: Technical overview of Basalt, a volcanic rock known for its durability
  and aesthetic versatility, ideal for laser cleaning applications due to its ability
  to withstand high energy pulses without significant degradation. Basalt's surface
  can be efficiently cleaned and restored using 1064nm wavelength lasers, which effectively
  remove contaminants while preserving the integrity and microstructure of the stone.
