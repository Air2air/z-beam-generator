caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the schist surface is obscured by a dense, heterogeneous
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, fills the natural micro-fissures
    and foliation planes. The underlying crystalline structure of mica and quartz
    is largely hidden, with the surface texture appearing matte and irregular due
    to the non-uniform deposition of contaminants.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a distinct transformation.
    The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine, foliated
    texture of the schist substrate. Individual mica flakes and quartz crystals are
    now clearly defined, with sharp boundaries and a return to the stone's intrinsic
    light reflectivity. The micro-topography is clean and well-defined, with no residual
    thermal damage or alteration to the mineral grains, confirming the procedure's
    precision.
