        research_basis: Schist demonstrates moderate corrosion resistance due to its
          metamorphic crystalline structure and mineral composition. While more resistant
          than sedimentary rocks like limestone, it is less durable than quartz-rich
          stones like granite. Schist's foliation can create planes of weakness where
          environmental degradation may occur over time. Performance varies significantly
          based on specific mineral composition and exposure conditions.

        research_basis: Schist, a metamorphic rock containing sheet silicate minerals
          like mica and chlorite, begins significant dehydration and oxidation (of
          iron-bearing minerals) around 400-450°C in air. This temperature marks the
          onset of structural degradation and mass loss, defining the upper limit
          for continuous service before material properties are compromised. The provided
          value is a conservative estimate from authoritative industry sources for
          general schist types.

          (1981), and a compilation of rock properties by Professor Z.T. Bieniawski.
        research_basis: Schist is a metamorphic rock with highly variable properties
          due to foliation. Flexural strength is highly anisotropic and depends on
          the orientation of the load relative to the foliation planes. A value of
          30 MPa is a representative mid-range figure for tests perpendicular to the
          foliation, as cited in authoritative rock mechanics handbooks. Values can
          range from 10 MPa to over 50 MPa depending on mineralogy and anisotropy.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of schist is highly variable (range
          ~50-300 MPa) due to its foliated nature, anisotropy, and mineral composition.
          The provided value of 150 MPa is a representative mid-range estimate for
          uniaxial compressive strength tested perpendicular to the foliation. Strength
          can be significantly lower when loaded parallel to the foliation planes.
