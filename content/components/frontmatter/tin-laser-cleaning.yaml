caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tin surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a porous, particulate
    texture, with agglomerations of carbonaceous soot and oxide particles embedded
    in a matrix of organic residues. The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely
    concealed. Cracking and delamination are visible at the interface with the tin
    substrate, indicating poor adhesion and a compromised surface.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine, polycrystalline structure of the tin substrate. The surface now
    displays clearly defined grain boundaries and the characteristic tetragonal crystal
    facets of β-tin. The cleaning process has produced a matte, microscopically textured
    finish with a peak-to-valley roughness (Ra) under 0.8 µm, a result of the selective
    ablation of contaminants without bulk melting.


    This refined surface topography enhances adhesion for subsequent processes like
    soldering or coating by increasing effective surface area. The removal of the
    insulating oxide and carbon layers restores the metal''s inherent thermal and
    electrical conductivity at the surface. The process has successfully eliminated
    the interfacial cracking and porosity, resulting in a metallurgically clean and
    stable surface finish suitable for high-performance applications.'
