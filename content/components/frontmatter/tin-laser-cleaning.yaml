caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the tin surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. A patchy oxide scale,
    approximately 2-5 micrometers thick, appears as a dull, greyish film with a cracked, mudflat-like texture. This is overlaid
    with localized carbonaceous deposits, presenting as dark, sooty agglomerations that fill the microscopic valleys of the
    native surface.


    The underlying tin substrate is partially visible in sporadic, isolated areas. These regions reveal the original metallic
    grain structure, but the boundaries are blurred and indistinct due to the pervasive overlying contamination. The overall
    topography is dominated by the contaminant layer, which exhibits low reflectivity and a matte, non-metallic finish.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification is fundamentally transformed. The patchy oxide film
    and carbonaceous deposits have been completely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying tin substrate. The surface
    now exhibits a consistent, highly reflective metallic luster, a direct result of the contaminant layer''s ablation.


    The native polycrystalline grain structure of the tin is now clearly defined and continuous across the entire field of
    view. Individual grain boundaries are sharp and distinct, with a uniform, micro-rough texture characteristic of the base
    metal. The removal of the insulating contamination layer has restored the surface''s intrinsic high reflectivity, confirming
    a return to the metal''s original, uncontaminated state.'
