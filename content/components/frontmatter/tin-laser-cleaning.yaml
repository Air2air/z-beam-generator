        research_basis: Tin exhibits excellent corrosion resistance in neutral and
          mild environments due to its protective oxide film. It resists corrosion
          from distilled water, seawater (under low oxygen), and many organic acids.
          However, it is vulnerable to strong acids, alkalis, and some specific chemical
          agents, preventing a perfect 10 rating.

          and Special-Purpose Materials" (ASM International, 1990), section on Tin
          and Tin Alloys.'
        research_basis: The ASM Handbook states that the maximum useful temperature
          for tin in air is generally considered to be 150°C. Above this temperature,
          the rate of oxidation increases significantly, forming SnO and SnO₂, which
          can lead to progressive degradation and "tin pest" transformation at lower
          temperatures after oxidation.

        source: MatWeb Material Property Data, "Tin, Sn"
        research_basis: The provided flexural strength value is derived from the relationship
          between a metal's tensile strength and its flexural strength, as they are
          often closely correlated for ductile materials. For pure tin, typical tensile
          strength values range from 11-20 MPa. The cited source, MatWeb, is a recognized
          database for material properties and lists a representative value for the
          ultimate tensile strength of commercially pure tin. The flexural strength
          (modulus of rupture) for a ductile metal like tin is generally similar to
          its ultimate tensile strength. The confidence is not 1.00 due to the inherent
          variability of mechanical properties based on purity, grain structure, and
          processing history.

        source: AZoM (AZoMaterials.com) - Tin (Sn) - Properties and Applications
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure tin is significantly lower
          than its tensile strength and is highly dependent on purity, grain structure,
          and strain rate. For high-purity tin, the compressive strength is typically
          in the range of 15-20 MPa. The provided hardness (5.0 MPa) is exceptionally
          low and may refer to a different scale or an extremely pure/annealed state,
          but it is consistent with tin being an extremely soft metal with low compressive
          resistance.
