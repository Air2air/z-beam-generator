subtitle: Tin has a very low melting point and is relatively soft compared to other
  non-ferrous metals. These traits demand careful control of laser power and scanning
  speed to prevent surface melting.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tin surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a topographically
    complex and irregular texture. The underlying metallic luster of the tin substrate
    is entirely masked, compromising its surface integrity and functional properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine, underlying tin substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey
    metallic appearance with the characteristic fine-grain structure of the tetragonal
    crystalline lattice clearly visible.


    The process eliminates all foreign material without fluid residue or secondary
    contamination. The cleaned surface displays minimal micro-roughness and no evidence
    of melting or heat distortion, confirming precise ablation at energy densities
    below the material''s damage threshold.


    This restoration results in a surface with optimized reflectivity and improved
    adhesion properties, directly enhancing performance in applications such as soldering
    and coating. The base metal is now fully exposed and functionally intact.'
