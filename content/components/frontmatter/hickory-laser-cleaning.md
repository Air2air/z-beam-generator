description: Technical overview of Hickory, a hardwood known for its durability and
  strength, for laser cleaning. Hickory's dense and tough nature requires precise
  control of laser parameters to effectively remove surface contaminants while preserving
  the integrity of the wood. The use of laser ablation at 1064nm wavelength and fluence
  range of 0.5-3.0 J/cm² ensures minimal thermal damage and optimal cleaning efficiency.
