        research_basis: Phenolic resin composites exhibit excellent chemical resistance
          to a wide range of solvents, acids, and weak alkalis due to their highly
          cross-linked aromatic structure. They maintain properties in humid environments
          and resist many industrial chemicals, though strong alkalis and oxidizing
          acids can cause degradation. This makes them superior to many polymers for
          corrosion applications.

        research_basis: MatWeb, a widely referenced engineering database, lists the
          maximum service temperature in air for phenolic cast resins as 177°C (350°F).
          This temperature represents the upper limit for continuous use before significant
          oxidative degradation begins, which is consistent with the thermal stability
          limits of the cross-linked phenolic polymer matrix in composite materials.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with glass-fiber reinforced phenolic composites. For this common material
          category, authoritative databases like MatWeb report flexural strength values
          typically in the range of 70-120 MPa. The value of 80 MPa is a conservative,
          representative figure for a general-purpose grade, as specific strength
          is highly dependent on the type and amount of fiber reinforcement and the
          test method (3-point bend per ASTM D790 is standard).

        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, "Phenolic Matrix Composites"'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of phenolic resin composites is highly
          dependent on the type and volume fraction of the reinforcing fibers (e.g.,
          glass, carbon). For a general-purpose glass fiber-reinforced phenolic composite,
          a typical compressive strength range is 100-200 MPa. The lower end of this
          range (100 MPa) is cited as a conservative, well-established value for a
          standard composite formulation, as confirmed by the ASM Handbook, a leading
          authoritative source on engineered materials. The provided properties (density,
          hardness) are consistent with this class of material.
