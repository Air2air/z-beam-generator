caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface is obscured
    by a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 10-50 µm in thickness. This layer
    consists of embedded carbonaceous soot, particulate matter, and a discontinuous
    film of degraded hydrocarbons. The underlying composite texture is masked, with
    contaminants filling the micro-porosity (typically 3.5%) and forming agglomerates
    along fiber reinforcement pathways.


    The contamination disrupts the surface''s functional integrity. The particulate
    agglomerates create a rough, irregular topography that can interfere with thermal
    and dimensional performance. The layer''s low thermal conductivity exacerbates
    heat retention, creating a risk of localized thermal stress that approaches the
    material''s 300°C decomposition threshold during subsequent processing or service.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively restores the pristine composite topography.
    The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct carbon fiber
    weave and the intact phenolic resin matrix. The surface porosity is now clearly
    visible and unobstructed.


    The process successfully ablated the contamination without damaging the substrate,
    as evidenced by the sharp, well-defined fiber edges and the absence of resin charring
    or micro-fractures. The surface now exhibits its inherent low reflectivity (0.12
    at 1064 nm) and uniform texture, critical for optimal performance.'
