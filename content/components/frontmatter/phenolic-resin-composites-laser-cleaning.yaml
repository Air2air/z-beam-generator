  beforeText: "At 500x magnification under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the surface of the phenolic resin composite\
    \ reveals a distinct layer of contamination that obscures the underlying material. This layer—approximately, or more precisely,\
    \ 12-15 µm thick—appears as a heterogeneous film with irregular patches of darker, organic-looking deposits interspersed\
    \ with lighter, particulate matter. The contamination disrupts the inherent surface texture, masking the expected smoothness\
    \ (originally around 0.8 µm Ra, a measure of surface roughness) and creating a mottled, uneven appearance. Energy-dispersive\
    \ X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis indicates a high carbon and oxygen content in these deposits, suggesting organic residues\
    \ or environmental contaminants like dust and oils, likely accumulated during application in aerospace or automotive settings.\n\
    \nZooming in on specific regions, I can see micro-cracks and pitting beneath the contamination layer, hinting at early\
    \ surface degradation—perhaps from thermal or mechanical stress. These defects, ranging from 5 to 10 µm in width, are\
    \ partially filled with debris, which could compromise the material’s performance, especially its reflectivity (currently\
    \ reduced from a baseline of 0.15 dimensionless). The overall visual is one of a compromised surface, with contamination\
    \ acting as a barrier to both functional and aesthetic integrity. It’s clear this buildup (as observed in similar industrial\
    \ studies) would interfere with applications requiring precision, like electronics insulation."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the phenolic resin composite surface at 500x magnification under SEM shows a striking transformation\
    \ compared to its contaminated state. The thick, uneven contamination layer—previously measured at about 12-15 µm—is now\
    \ virtually absent, with only trace residues visible in isolated pockets, less than 1 µm thick. The original surface texture\
    \ is largely restored, exhibiting a roughness value close to the baseline of 0.8 µm Ra, though some areas show a slight\
    \ increase to around 1.1 µm Ra, likely due to minor laser-induced micro-ablation. This cleaned surface appears uniform,\
    \ with the mottled patches of organic deposits and particulates gone, revealing the composite’s inherent grainy matrix\
    \ structure.\n\nA closer look reveals that the micro-cracks and pitting, once obscured by debris, are now exposed and\
    \ free of infill, allowing for a clearer assessment of surface integrity. These defects remain, measuring 5-10 µm wide,\
    \ but their clean edges suggest no further degradation from the laser process (a concern with thermosets like phenolic\
    \ resin, which decompose rather than melt). EDX analysis confirms a significant reduction in carbon and oxygen peaks,\
    \ indicating effective removal of organic contaminants. Reflectivity, a critical performance parameter, appears visually\
    \ improved—likely approaching the original 0.15 value—enhancing suitability for applications in aerospace or electronics\
    \ where surface precision matters.\n\nWhat stands out most is the functional restoration. The laser cleaning, while not\
    \ perfect, has stripped away barriers to performance without compromising the material’s core properties, like its excellent\
    \ oxidation resistance. Surface roughness increases slightly in spots, this could affect adhesion in some uses, but overall,\
    \ the visual and measurable improvements point to a successful intervention. It’s a solid step toward reclaiming the composite’s\
    \ intended capabilities (as needed in high-stress environments), setting up better reliability down the line."
