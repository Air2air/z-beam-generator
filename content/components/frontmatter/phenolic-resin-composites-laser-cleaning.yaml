caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the phenolic resin composite surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer,
    measuring 15-25 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a carbonized film, creating
    a textured, discontinuous topography that masks the underlying composite structure.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, with agglomerated particles up to 10 micrometers in diameter
    firmly adhered to the surface. The original fiber reinforcement pattern of the composite is no longer visible, as the
    porous contaminant layer has filled the natural surface texture, which typically has an average roughness (Ra) of 1.8
    µm. This significantly alters the surface''s physical characteristics.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a complete transformation at 500x magnification. The thick contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine phenolic resin matrix and the distinct pattern of the fiber reinforcement.
    The original surface roughness of approximately 1.8 µm Ra is now fully restored.


    The laser process has effectively ablated the contaminant without damaging the underlying composite. The surface is now
    free of particulate matter and carbonized residue, displaying a clean, well-defined interface between the resin and fibers.
    This confirms the successful removal of the obscuring layer while preserving the material''s structural integrity.'
