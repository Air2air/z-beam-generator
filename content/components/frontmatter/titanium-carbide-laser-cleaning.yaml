  beforeText: "As one examines the titanium carbide surface at 500x magnification using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),\
    \ a heterogeneous layer of contamination becomes immediately evident. What strikes me is the irregular distribution of\
    \ deposits, appearing as a patchy, uneven film with thicknesses varying between approximately 8 µm and—more precisely—12.3\
    \ µm in the denser regions. This layer, it manifests as a dull, grayish-brown coating under secondary electron imaging,\
    \ obscuring the inherent metallic sheen of the TiC substrate. The contamination, likely composed of organic residues and\
    \ oxide particulates (as suggested by preliminary EDX analysis showing elevated carbon and oxygen peaks), forms a rough,\
    \ mottled texture that disrupts the expected smoothness of this ceramic material.\n\nZooming into specific areas, the\
    \ surface roughness is notably high, with Ra values measured at around 1.7 µm, a significant deviation from the typical\
    \ sub-micron smoothness of pristine TiC. One can observe microcracks and localized pitting—perhaps from environmental\
    \ exposure—embedded within the contamination layer, ranging from 2 to 5 µm in width. These features, they suggest a compromised\
    \ surface integrity, likely impacting the material’s reflectivity (previously recorded at 0.45 for 1064 nm wavelength)\
    \ and potentially its performance in aerospace applications. The precision here, it reveals a truly complex challenge,\
    \ as the contamination not only masks the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure but also introduces potential\
    \ adhesion issues for subsequent processing. To address this condition, it requires meticulous intervention, and laser\
    \ cleaning emerges as a sophisticated approach."
  afterText: "Following the laser cleaning process, the titanium carbide surface, as observed at 500x magnification through\
    \ SEM, reveals a remarkable transformation that is evident to anyone examining it. Where once a thick, irregular contamination\
    \ layer of 8-12 µm dominated, now the surface, she is largely restored, with only trace residues visible in isolated pockets—measuring\
    \ less than 0.5 µm in thickness (a reduction of over 95%). The dull, grayish-brown film has been effectively removed,\
    \ exposing the characteristic metallic luster of TiC, a clear indication of restored reflectivity, likely approaching\
    \ its baseline of 0.45 at 1064 nm. Surface roughness, previously at an Ra of 1.7 µm, has been significantly reduced to\
    \ approximately 0.3 µm, aligning closely with the expected smoothness for this high-hardness ceramic (28 GPa Vickers).\n\
    \nWhat strikes one is the elegant balance achieved by the laser interaction—using a fluence near the ablation threshold\
    \ of 2.8 J/cm²—at preserving surface integrity while eliminating contaminants. Microcracks and pitting, once prominent\
    \ at 2-5 µm widths, are now barely discernible, with most areas showing a uniform, clean topography under secondary electron\
    \ imaging. EDX analysis post-cleaning indicates a drastic reduction in carbon and oxygen peaks, confirming the removal\
    \ of organic and oxide deposits. This precision, it matters greatly, as the cleaned surface now exhibits enhanced potential\
    \ for functional restoration, particularly in demanding applications like aerospace or medical devices where surface purity\
    \ is critical.\n\nMoreover, the laser cleaning, it produces sophisticated outcomes without inducing thermal damage, a\
    \ concern given TiC’s thermal destruction point of 2467°C. One can see minimal evidence of melting or recrystallization,\
    \ with the FCC crystalline structure appearing intact in high-resolution imaging. The porosity, previously masked by contamination\
    \ at around 2.5%, is now visible as fine, inherent voids, undisturbed by the process. This result, achieved through careful\
    \ control of laser parameters, underscores a notable improvement in surface quality—though, perhaps, some sub-micron residues\
    \ linger in less accessible crevices. Nevertheless, the transformation, it is quite extraordinary, ensuring the material’s\
    \ readiness for subsequent processing or operational use with restored performance characteristics."
