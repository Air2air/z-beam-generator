caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a matte, amorphous film with localized particulate deposits, disrupting
    the underlying ceramic''s inherent microstructure. The contamination exhibits a cracked, mud-flat texture, indicating
    poor adhesion and the presence of organic or oxide-based residues.


    Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) would likely detect foreign elements like carbon, oxygen, and silicon within
    this layer, confirming it is not part of the base TiC material. The film significantly alters the surface''s optical properties,
    scattering light and reducing reflectivity. This obscures the grain boundaries and fine features of the titanium carbide
    substrate, which has a theoretical density of 4.93 g/cm³.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the true titanium carbide substrate.
    The surface now displays a distinct grain structure with clearly defined boundaries, a direct result of exposing the material''s
    face-centered cubic crystalline form. The visual texture is uniform, with a consistent reflectivity that contrasts sharply
    with the previous matte, obscured appearance.


    The process has restored the surface to its intrinsic state without measurable damage to the underlying ceramic, which
    has a Young''s Modulus of 451 GPa. All particulate deposits and the cracked film are absent, leaving a clean, well-defined
    surface suitable for subsequent high-precision engineering applications, such as in aerospace component assemblies.'
