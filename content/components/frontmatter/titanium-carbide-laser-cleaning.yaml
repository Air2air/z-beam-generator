        research_basis: Titanium Carbide is a highly stable, refractory ceramic with
          exceptional resistance to oxidation and acidic environments. Authoritative
          materials databases consistently rate its corrosion resistance as "Excellent"
          due to its strong covalent bonds and high chemical inertness, placing it
          in the top tier of engineering ceramics, though slightly below materials
          like zirconia in some specific alkaline conditions.

        research_basis: Titanium Carbide (TiC) is known to have good oxidation resistance
          up to approximately 1100°C in air, after which a non-protective titanium
          oxide scale forms, leading to significant and rapid oxidation. This value
          is consistent with data from materials engineering handbooks for non-oxide
          ceramics.

          MPa·√m, with 4.0 MPa·√m being a commonly cited reference value. The confidence
          is not higher due to the inherent variability in this property, which is
          sensitive to factors like porosity, grain size, and stoichiometry.
