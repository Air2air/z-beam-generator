caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium carbide surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contaminant layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded oxides, carbonaceous soot, and metallic splatter, creates a matte,
    textured topography that masks the underlying ceramic's grain structure. The contamination
    adheres within surface pores and forms dendritic patterns, significantly increasing
    surface roughness and scattering incident light.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation. The contaminant
    layer is entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic, fine-grained microstructure
    of the sintered TiC. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey appearance
    with clearly defined grain boundaries and a consistent micro-texture from the
    original sintering process. The primary improvement is the elimination of light-scattering
    contaminants, resulting in a surface defined by its inherent 2.5% porosity and
    grain morphology. This restoration to the base material's topography ensures optimal
    surface energy and mechanical properties for subsequent coating or bonding processes,
    with no observable thermal cracking or melting due to the controlled laser parameters
    operating below the material's 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold.
