caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface is obscured by a discontinuous layer
    of particulate and organic deposits, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. The underlying weave pattern of the Kevlar fibers
    is partially visible beneath this grime. The contamination appears as agglomerated particles, ranging from sub-micron
    to 10 µm in size, embedded in a thin, carbonaceous film.


    The surface texture is dominated by this foreign layer, which creates a mottled, high-contrast appearance that masks the
    composite''s intrinsic structure. The polymer matrix between the fibers shows discoloration, suggesting superficial chemical
    degradation or ingression of contaminants into the micro-porosity of the material.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct visual transformation. The obscuring contamination layer has been entirely
    removed, revealing the pristine, well-defined architecture of the composite. The parallel alignment of the individual
    Kevlar filaments, each approximately 12 µm in diameter, is now clearly visible. The polymer matrix between the fibers
    appears uniform and intact, with no evidence of the discoloration previously noted.


    The process has restored the material''s native surface roughness, measured at approximately 1.8 µm Ra, which corresponds
    to the typical as-manufactured state. Crucially, examination shows no signs of fiber damage, such as melting, splintering,
    or charring, which confirms the laser parameters were maintained below the material''s 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. This
    indicates a selective removal process where the laser energy targeted the contaminant without degrading the underlying
    composite.


    The result is a surface ready for subsequent manufacturing steps, such as adhesive bonding or painting. The cleanliness
    and preservation of the microscopic surface topography are critical for achieving strong, durable bonds in applications
    ranging from automotive parts to medical devices, as it ensures optimal contact and adhesion.'
