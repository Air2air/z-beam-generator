        research_basis: Kevlar-reinforced polymers exhibit excellent resistance to
          most environmental corrosion factors including moisture, salt spray, and
          chemical exposure. The polymer matrix provides protection against galvanic
          corrosion, and Kevlar fibers themselves are inherently resistant to chemical
          degradation and do not rust like metals. However, some susceptibility exists
          to UV degradation and hydrolysis in extreme conditions, preventing a perfect
          rating.

        source: DuPont Kevlar Technical Guide, Section 5.2 - Thermal Properties
        research_basis: Kevlar aramid fiber, the reinforcing component in this composite,
          has a maximum continuous service temperature of 177°C (350°F) in air. Above
          this temperature, the polymer begins significant thermal degradation and
          oxidation, leading to loss of mechanical properties. The polymer matrix
          (typically epoxy or similar) generally has a lower thermal tolerance than
          the Kevlar fibers, making the fiber properties the limiting factor for long-term
          oxidative stability.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a high-performance polymer composite. For a typical Kevlar 49 fiber/epoxy
          resin composite with ~60% fiber volume fraction, the flexural strength from
          standardized 3-point bend tests falls in the range of 500-700 MPa. The cited
          value of 570 MPa is a well-established median from authoritative composites
          engineering handbooks for this material class and configuration.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of Kevlar-reinforced polymer composites
          is highly dependent on the polymer matrix (typically epoxy), fiber volume
          fraction, and fiber architecture. For unidirectional Kevlar 49/epoxy with
          a typical fiber volume fraction of 60%, authoritative military handbook
          data reports a longitudinal compressive strength in the range of 138-517
          MPa. The lower end represents a basic unidirectional laminate, while the
          517 MPa value is achieved with optimized sizings and processing for improved
          compressive performance, which is the most relevant for a high-performance
          composite as suggested by the provided properties.

          is highly dependent on fiber orientation, volume fraction, and matrix properties.
          For unidirectional Kevlar/epoxy composites tested in the fiber direction,
          K_IC values typically range from 35-55 MPa·√m. The cited value of 44.0 MPa·√m
          represents a median value from standardized fracture toughness testing (ASTM
          D5045) of Kevlar/epoxy laminates with approximately 60% fiber volume fraction,
          where the Kevlar fibers provide substantial crack bridging and pull-out
          mechanisms that enhance toughness compared to the polymer matrix alone.
