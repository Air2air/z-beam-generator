caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface is obscured
    by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5–15 µm thick. This layer,
    composed of embedded carbonaceous soot and amorphous oxide deposits, masks the
    underlying composite topography. The contaminants form a crust-like morphology,
    filling the micro-valleys of the 1.8 µm Ra surface texture and creating a matte,
    occluded appearance that compromises interfacial adhesion for subsequent processing.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer with high selectivity,
    revealing the pristine composite surface. The characteristic woven fiber pattern
    of the Kevlar filaments and the texture of the epoxy matrix are now fully exposed.
    The original 1.8 µm Ra surface roughness is restored, with no evidence of the
    previously obscuring deposits.


    The process achieves this result through precise control of laser fluence, maintaining
    an energy density below the 4.2 J/cm² damage threshold of the polymer matrix.
    This ensures the selective ablation of contaminants, which have a lower ablation
    threshold, while preserving the structural integrity of the Kevlar fibers and
    the surrounding epoxy. The surface is left in a chemically clean state, optimized
    for bonding or coating.'
