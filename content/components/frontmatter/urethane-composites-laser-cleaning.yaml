caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface is obscured by a continuous, non-uniform contamination
    layer measuring 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a textured, amorphous crust with embedded particulate matter,
    creating a topographically complex surface. The underlying composite''s molded texture is completely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, suggesting a dried organic or polymeric residue. Fine, sub-micron
    particulates are distributed uniformly across this matrix, while larger, irregular agglomerates up to 50 micrometers in
    diameter are scattered sporadically. This heterogeneous layer significantly alters the surface''s native properties, increasing
    light scattering and creating potential sites for adhesion failure.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine urethane composite substrate.
    The surface now displays the material''s intrinsic molded texture with sharp, well-defined features. The previously obscured
    fine fibrous reinforcement and filler particles within the composite matrix are now clearly visible.


    The transformation is evident in the restoration of surface integrity. No residual contamination or thermal damage is
    observed at this magnification. The uniform, clean surface exhibits consistent reflectivity, indicating the successful
    removal of the light-scattering layer without altering the composite''s underlying structure.'
