caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface is obscured by
    a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer,
    composed of embedded particulate and hydrocarbon films, creates a mottled, high-contrast
    topography that masks the underlying polymer structure. The contaminants fill
    the natural micro-porosity (approx. 2.5%) and increase the surface roughness significantly
    beyond the native 1.8 µm Ra. The original Shore D 85 hardness surface texture
    is completely hidden beneath this discontinuous, optically dense film, which exhibits
    poor adhesion to the composite substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the original polymer matrix and its characteristic
    1.8 µm Ra micro-texture. The surface is now uniform, with no residual film or
    thermal damage, confirming precise ablation at the 1.2 J/cm² threshold.
