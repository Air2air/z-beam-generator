caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers
    in thickness, consists of particulate matter, organic residues, and adsorbed water
    vapor. The contaminants create a topographically complex and irregular surface,
    disrupting the inherent smoothness of the underlying glass substrate.


    The surface texture appears mottled, with localized pitting and smeared films.
    These features significantly increase light scattering, which is visible as a
    diffuse haze. The contamination layer masks the pristine, amorphous structure
    of the glass, compromising its optical clarity and creating potential sites for
    chemical degradation or adhesion failure.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored, pristine
    soda-lime glass substrate. The contamination layer has been completely removed
    via selective laser ablation, exposing the native surface with a roughness of
    approximately 0.5 nm Ra. The transformation is evident in the restoration of a
    uniform, featureless, and atomically smooth topography.


    The surface now exhibits its inherent high transmissivity, with no evidence of
    the previous light-scattering haze. The cleaning process has eliminated the micro-pits
    and residue films, leaving a chemically clean interface. This optically superior
    surface is now suitable for high-performance applications requiring unimpeded
    light transmission and reliable adhesion.'
