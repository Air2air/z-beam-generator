caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the soda-lime glass surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer. Particulate matter, 5-20 µm in diameter, is embedded
    in a thin, amorphous film. This film, approximately 1-3 µm thick, exhibits micro-fissures
    and adheres to the native glass, masking its inherent smoothness and creating
    a topographically complex, occluded surface that scatters light and degrades optical
    performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the contamination layer, revealing the
    pristine glass substrate. The surface now exhibits the inherent smoothness and
    minimal micro-roughness characteristic of soda-lime glass. At 500x, the homogeneous,
    vitreous structure is clearly visible, with no residual film or embedded particulates,
    resulting in a surface optimized for high light transmission and clarity.
