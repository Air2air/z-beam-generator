        research_basis: Soda-lime glass exhibits excellent resistance to water, acidic
          solutions, and atmospheric conditions. While susceptible to strong alkaline
          solutions, it maintains high chemical stability against most common environmental
          corrodants including weathering, moisture, and many chemicals. The Corning
          Museum notes soda-lime glass's "good chemical durability" with only slight
          susceptibility to alkaline attack, supporting a high rating for general
          environmental corrosion resistance.

        research_basis: Soda-lime glass has a maximum continuous service temperature
          of 400-450°C in air before thermal degradation begins. Above this range,
          viscosity decreases significantly and surface oxidation/crystallization
          can occur, though soda-lime glass doesn't oxidize like metals but rather
          undergoes structural changes and surface devitrification.

        source: ASTM C158 "Standard Test Methods for Strength of Glass by Flexure
          (Determination of Modulus of Rupture)"
        research_basis: Soda-lime glass, being a brittle material, has a well-documented
          flexural strength typically ranging from 30-90 MPa. The value of 50 MPa
          represents a conservative, commonly cited average for bulk, non-tempered
          soda-lime glass tested in a 4-point bend configuration as per the ASTM standard,
          which is the definitive test method for this property. The strength is highly
          dependent on surface quality and test conditions.

        source: '"Engineered Materials Handbook, Desk Edition", ASM International,
          Section on Glasses and Glass-Ceramics.'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of soda-lime glass is significantly
          higher than its tensile strength. While tensile strength is typically in
          the 30-90 MPa range, the compressive strength is consistently cited in engineering
          references as being on the order of 1,000 MPa (1 GPa). This high value is
          due to the amorphous structure of glass, which is not susceptible to the
          dislocation movement that limits the compressive strength of crystalline
          materials. The value can vary based on surface condition and test method,
          but 1000 MPa is a standard reference value for bulk material.
