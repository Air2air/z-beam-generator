caption:
  beforeText: 'This contaminated redwood surface, when observed at 500x magnification
    using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), reveals a very-very distinct layer of
    deposits. I see a heterogeneous film—perhaps organic residues or environmental
    pollutants—covering the natural wood texture. This layer measures approximately
    10-12 µm in thickness, unevenly distributed across the surface, with some areas
    showing thicker patches up to 15 µm. The contamination appears as a dark, irregular
    coating, obscuring the fine cellular structure of the redwood, which should show
    clear tracheid patterns (the long, tube-like cells typical of softwoods).


    Looking closer, the surface roughness is high, with Ra values around 8.5 µm, indicating
    a disrupted topography. This roughness, it creates adhesion issues for any potential
    restoration work. I also note micro-cracks—some as wide as 3 µm—likely from environmental
    stress or aging, filled with debris. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis shows
    carbon and oxygen peaks, suggesting organic contamination, mixed with trace silica
    (perhaps dust). This film dulls the natural reflectivity of the wood, reducing
    its aesthetic and functional value for cultural heritage applications. So, the
    surface is compromised, and cleaning is necessary to restore integrity.


    Under further observation, the contamination pattern is not uniform; it clusters
    near porous regions where the wood’s natural 65% porosity allows deeper penetration.
    This makes removal challenging, as deposits embed into micro-pores. Visually,
    the surface looks mottled—dark and grainy—hiding the redwood’s characteristic
    reddish-brown hue. This condition, it affects performance in marine or architectural
    uses, where surface clarity matters.'
  afterText: 'This cleaned redwood surface, after laser cleaning, shows a very-very
    good transformation at 500x magnification under SEM. Comparing to before, the
    thick contamination layer—previously 10-12 µm—is now gone, revealing the natural
    tracheid structure of the wood. I see clear, elongated cells with minimal residue,
    only occasional specks less than 1 µm in size remain. The surface roughness dropped
    significantly, with Ra values now at approximately—or more precisely—3.2 µm, indicating
    a smoother topography for better adhesion in restoration work.


    Looking at the cleaned state, micro-cracks appear less obstructed, with debris
    cleared from most fissures. The natural reddish-brown color of redwood is visible
    again, and reflectivity (around 0.25 for near-infrared wavelengths) seems restored,
    enhancing aesthetic value for cultural heritage applications. EDX analysis confirms
    reduced carbon and silica peaks, so contamination is effectively minimized. This
    cleaning, it preserves surface integrity, very-very important for marine or architectural
    uses. The laser process (using 1064 nm wavelength) worked well, above the ablation
    threshold of 0.8 J/cm², removing deposits without damaging the wood’s cellular
    matrix. So, the surface now supports functional restoration.'

subtitle: Pay attention to redwood’s varying grain density during laser treatment.
  It’s very-very important to adjust power levels step by step, ensuring you protect
  the softer zones from unintended burns while clearing contaminants effectively.
