caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the redwood surface is obscured by a dense, stratified contamination layer approximately
    50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded soot, biological growth, and degraded finishes, fills the wood's porous
    cellular structure. The underlying tracheids and ray cells are largely invisible, with the surface texture appearing amorphous
    and matte due to the contaminant's high, diffuse light absorption, which masks the wood's natural grain definition.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the redwood''s microscopic surface topography. The contaminant layer has been
    completely ablated, revealing the intricate, open cellular network of tracheids and parenchyma cells. The surface now
    exhibits a clear, textured profile with sharp edges and deep, open lumens.


    The cleaning process has selectively removed foreign material without damaging the underlying wood cell walls. This precision
    is evident in the intact middle lamella and the sharp definition between adjacent cells, which were previously fused by
    contamination.


    The result is a surface with high micro-roughness and minimal subsurface charring. This open, clean structure significantly
    improves the substrate for subsequent conservation treatments, such as consolidant penetration, by providing an unobstructed
    interface with the original wood material.'
