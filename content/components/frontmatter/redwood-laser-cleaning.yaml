        research_basis: Redwood has moderate natural decay resistance due to extractives
          like tannins and thujaplicins, but this is primarily against biological
          decay rather than chemical corrosion. It performs better than most softwoods
          but is not as durable as treated woods or naturally resistant tropical hardwoods.
          The rating reflects good performance in above-ground applications but poor
          resistance in ground contact or marine environments without preservative
          treatment.

          Forest Products Laboratory.'
        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is a primary authority. It states that prolonged exposure to temperatures
          above 200 °C leads to significant thermal degradation (pyrolysis) and charring
          of wood, even in the absence of flame. This temperature is considered the
          practical upper limit before significant oxidative mass loss begins.

          Forest Products Laboratory.'
        research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally
          recognized authority on wood properties. For "Redwood, old-growth," it lists
          a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 65 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the
          standard measure of flexural/bending strength from a 3-point bend test.
          This value is consistent with the known low density of Redwood, placing
          it in the low-to-medium strength category for commercial softwoods.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook, published by the USDA Forest Products Laboratory,
          is the principal authoritative source for wood properties in the United
          States. It lists the compressive strength parallel to the grain for Redwood
          (Sequoia sempervirens) at 12% moisture content as 31.2 MPa. This value is
          consistent with the provided hardness property, as compressive strength
          and hardness are often correlated for wood species.
