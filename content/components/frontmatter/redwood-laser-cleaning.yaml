caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the redwood surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, biological growth, and degraded finishes, fills the wood's porous cellular
    structure. The underlying tracheids and ray cells are largely invisible, with
    the surface texture appearing amorphous and matte due to the contaminant's high,
    diffuse light absorption, which masks the wood's natural grain definition.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the redwood''s microscopic surface
    topography. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, revealing the intricate,
    open cellular network of tracheids and parenchyma cells. The surface now exhibits
    a clear, textured profile with sharp edges and deep, open lumens.


    The cleaning process has selectively removed foreign material without damaging
    the underlying wood cell walls. This precision is evident in the intact middle
    lamella and the sharp definition between adjacent cells, which were previously
    fused by contamination.


    The result is a surface with high micro-roughness and minimal subsurface charring.
    This open, clean structure significantly improves the substrate for subsequent
    conservation treatments, such as consolidant penetration, by providing an unobstructed
    interface with the original wood material.'
