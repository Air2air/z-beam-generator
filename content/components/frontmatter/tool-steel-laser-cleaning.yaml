subtitle: Tool steel's hardness can vary significantly between grades, so you can't
  rely on a single set of parameters. This variability means we must carefully assess
  each piece to select the appropriate power and pulse frequency.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the surface is obscured by a non-uniform contaminant
    layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous soot,
    oxide particles, and residual lubricants. The underlying steel's microstructure
    is entirely hidden, and the surface texture appears matte and irregular due to
    this particulate film.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning completely removes the contaminant layer, revealing the
    true tool steel substrate. The matte, obscured surface is replaced by a clearly
    defined metallic microstructure. At 500x, the fine grain boundaries and carbide
    distributions within the steel matrix become distinctly visible, features that
    were entirely masked before cleaning.


    The process selectively ablates contaminants without damaging the underlying steel.
    The resulting surface texture is markedly cleaner and more uniform, transitioning
    from a rough, particulate-covered state to a smooth, bare metal finish. Minor,
    pre-existing polishing lines or grinding marks from the original manufacturing
    may now be apparent.


    This reveals a surface primed for subsequent processes. The absence of micro-scale
    contaminants and oxides eliminates potential initiation sites for pitting corrosion
    and ensures optimal adhesion for coatings like PVD, TiN, or thermal sprays, directly
    enhancing the tool''s performance and service life.'
