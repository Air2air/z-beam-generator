subtitle: Tool steel's hardness can vary significantly between grades, so you can't
  rely on a single set of parameters. This variability means we must carefully assess
  each piece to select the appropriate power and pulse frequency.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tool steel surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A carbon-rich oxide scale, approximately 5-15 micrometers
    thick, forms a brittle, fractured crust. Embedded within this matrix are fine
    particulate contaminants, including silica dust and residual lubricants, which
    fill the micro-valleys of the original surface texture. This layer completely
    masks the underlying steel's grain structure and micro-features.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the tool steel's inherent
    metallurgical structure. The contaminant layer is entirely removed, exposing a
    clean, micro-rough surface with a distinct grain boundary pattern. The underlying
    machining marks or mill finish are now fully visible, free of embedded particulates.
    This results in a surface defined by its base metal topography, with no chemical
    or physical alteration to the steel substrate.
