subtitle: Tool steel's varied composition means it won't respond uniformly across
  a component, so your laser parameters must be mapped to its specific grade and hardness.
  This careful approach preserves the integrity of the underlying metal while stripping
  away contaminants.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tool steel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contaminant layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbon deposits, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and residual lubricants. The
    topography is highly irregular, with particulate matter and pitting that masks
    the underlying steel's grain structure and creates potential sites for stress
    concentration.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contaminant layer, revealing the intact, underlying
    steel substrate. The surface now exhibits the original tool steel microstructure,
    with a clear grain boundary pattern and fine machining marks. The process selectively
    ablates contaminants without damaging the base metal, resulting in a metallurgically
    clean surface with a peak-to-valley roughness (Ra) often improved by 10-30%. This
    provides an optimal surface for subsequent treatments or adhesion.
