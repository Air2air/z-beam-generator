subtitle: Tool steel's hardness can vary significantly between grades, so you can't
  rely on a single set of parameters. This variability means we must carefully assess
  each piece to select the appropriate power and pulse frequency.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the tool steel surface is obscured by a complex
    layer of contamination. A carbon-rich residue, from lubricant breakdown and heat
    exposure, forms a discontinuous, sooty film measuring 5-15 micrometers thick.
    This layer is punctuated by embedded metallic smears and microscopic oxide particles.


    The underlying steel''s microstructure is entirely hidden. The surface texture
    is irregular and matte, with contamination filling the natural micro-valleys of
    the metal. This layer creates a physical barrier that can interfere with subsequent
    processes like coating adhesion or precision measurement, and its uneven thickness
    indicates inconsistent prior surface conditions.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine, unaltered tool steel substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform,
    light gray, matte finish with a consistent micro-texture. The laser process has
    selectively ablated contaminants without damaging the underlying metal.


    At 500x, the steel''s inherent grain structure and fine machining marks are now
    clearly visible. The surface is free of residue, exposing a clean, metallurgically
    intact surface with a peak-to-valley roughness typically under 0.5 micrometers.
    This state provides an optimal foundation for further manufacturing operations.'
