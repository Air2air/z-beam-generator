caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the CFRP surface is obscured by a non-uniform contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of embedded particulates and a polymer-based residue, creates a discontinuous, textured film that masks the underlying composite structure. The carbon fiber weave pattern is only faintly visible beneath this contamination, which adheres strongly within the micro-scale valleys of the surface topography. The presence of this layer significantly alters the surface's thermal and optical properties, impeding performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the CFRP's native microstructure. The contaminant layer is completely absent, revealing the distinct, undulating topography of the carbon fiber weave and the contrasting epoxy matrix. Individual fibers are now clearly defined, with surface roughness returning to the intrinsic 1.5 µm Ra. This exposes the pristine, highly absorptive carbon surface, restoring optimal thermal and adhesive characteristics without subsurface damage to the composite.
