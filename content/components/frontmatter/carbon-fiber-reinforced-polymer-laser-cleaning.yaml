caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the CFRP surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer, composed of
    release agents, atmospheric soot, and handling residues, creates a discontinuous
    film that masks the underlying composite texture. The topography is dominated
    by agglomerated particulate matter and smeared organic deposits, which fill the
    inter-fiber voids and create a mottled, high-contrast pattern. This obscures the
    distinct, organized structure of the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix, significantly
    altering the surface's visual and physical characteristics from its engineered
    state.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals a complete restoration
    of the CFRP's intrinsic surface morphology. The contamination layer has been entirely
    removed via ablation, exposing the clean, well-defined carbon filaments and the
    recessed epoxy matrix. The surface now displays the material's characteristic
    anisotropic texture, with individual fibers and their parallel alignment clearly
    visible. This exposes the true composite architecture, eliminating the visual
    noise and ensuring the surface properties are governed by the material itself,
    not by extrinsic contaminants.
