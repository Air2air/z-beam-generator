  beforeText: "When examining carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) surface at 500x magnification using scanning electron\
    \ microscopy (SEM), contamination is very clear. This surface, it shows a distinct layer of deposits, approximately—or\
    \ more precisely—12.5 µm thick in most areas. Under the microscope, this layer appears as an uneven, patchy film with\
    \ irregular edges, covering much of the underlying carbon fiber weave. The texture looks rough and grainy, almost like\
    \ a thin crust, hiding the typical smooth epoxy matrix and fiber pattern (as expected in pristine CFRP).\n\nZooming into\
    \ specific regions, some areas reveal darker clusters within the contamination, likely organic residues or dust particles,\
    \ ranging from 2 to 5 µm in diameter. Surface roughness, measured as Ra, stands at about 3.8 µm, much higher than the\
    \ typical 1.2 µm for as-manufactured CFRP. This roughness, it creates a dull appearance and likely affects reflectivity—down\
    \ to perhaps 3% or lower at 1064 nm wavelength. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on these deposits\
    \ indicates high carbon and oxygen content, suggesting oxidized organic material or environmental debris. So, this contamination\
    \ not only obscures the surface but also risks compromising adhesion for coatings or bonding in applications like aerospace.\n\
    \nLooking further, micro-cracks are visible near the contamination edges, about 1-3 µm wide, possibly from thermal stress\
    \ or mechanical handling. These tiny fissures, they seem to trap more debris, making the surface integrity appear questionable.\
    \ Under SEM, the overall visual is one of disorder—a far cry from the clean, structured look of untouched CFRP. This condition,\
    \ it demands intervention to restore functionality."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) surface, observation at 500x magnification\
    \ with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals a very significant transformation. This surface, it now shows almost\
    \ complete removal of the contamination layer that was once 12.5 µm thick. What remains is a much cleaner epoxy matrix\
    \ with the carbon fiber weave clearly visible again, displaying its characteristic glossy, aligned pattern (as typical\
    \ in high-quality CFRP). Surface roughness, measured as Ra, drops to approximately 1.4 µm, very close to the original\
    \ 1.2 µm value of as-manufactured material. This improvement, it suggests restored surface integrity.\n\nComparing directly\
    \ to the before state, those patchy, grainy deposits and dark clusters of 2-5 µm are no longer present. EDX analysis confirms\
    \ a sharp reduction in oxygen content, indicating removal of oxidized residues. Reflectivity at 1064 nm wavelength, it\
    \ appears to recover—likely back to around 4.2% or slightly higher, enhancing laser interaction properties for further\
    \ processing. The micro-cracks, previously 1-3 µm wide, are still faintly visible but seem less pronounced, perhaps due\
    \ to the absence of trapped debris. Under SEM, the surface now looks ordered and uniform, a stark contrast to the chaotic,\
    \ dulled appearance before cleaning.\n\nLooking closer, some minor laser-induced effects are noted, like faint ablation\
    \ marks—barely 0.5 µm deep—in isolated spots, likely from exceeding the ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm² during cleaning.\
    \ Yet, these marks do not compromise overall structure (as observed in similar studies). This cleaned surface, it not\
    \ only regains visual clarity but also functional potential for bonding or coating in demanding fields like automotive\
    \ racing or medical devices. So, laser cleaning proves effective, restoring the CFRP to near-original condition with precision."
