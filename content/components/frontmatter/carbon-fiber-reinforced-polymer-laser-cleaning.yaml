caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the CFRP surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, measuring 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer appears as a textured, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter, creating a topographical
    landscape that masks the underlying carbon fiber weave. The contamination adheres to the fiber bundles and resin-rich
    areas, forming a non-uniform coating that increases the surface roughness to an Ra value exceeding 10 µm.


    The film''s morphology suggests a mixture of organic residues and fine inorganic particles. It fills the microscopic valleys
    between fiber tows, effectively smoothing the composite''s natural textured pattern at this scale. The original, distinct
    fiber-matrix boundary is visually blurred, and the surface exhibits a mottled, high-contrast appearance under the microscope
    due to the varying thickness of the deposited material.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the amorphous contamination layer, revealing the pristine, underlying
    composite structure. The previously obscured carbon fiber weave is now distinctly visible, with individual 5-10 micrometer
    diameter filaments clearly defined within their tows. The surface roughness has been significantly reduced, returning
    to the material''s intrinsic Ra range of 0.5-5.0 µm.


    The laser process has selectively ablated the contaminant without damaging the critical fiber-matrix interface. The epoxy
    matrix appears intact, with no evidence of thermal degradation such as bubbling or charring, which would occur above the
    polymer''s glass transition temperature of 120-180°C. The cleaning has restored the original surface topography, with
    clean, sharp boundaries between the high-modulus fibers and the surrounding polymer.


    This result confirms the laser''s precision, operating within the material''s ablation threshold of 0.5-2.0 J/cm² to remove
    contaminant while preserving the composite''s structural integrity. The surface is now optimally prepared for subsequent
    processes like bonding or coating, with maximum adhesion potential provided by the clean, well-defined microscopic landscape.'
