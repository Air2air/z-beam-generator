description: Technical overview of Birch, a hardwood known for its light color and
  fine grain, for laser cleaning applications. Birch's density and thermal properties
  make it suitable for laser ablation and cleaning, particularly for restoring antique
  furniture and preparing wood surfaces in construction. The use of 1064 nm wavelength
  lasers with controlled fluence ensures precise removal of contaminants without damaging
  the wood's structural integrity.
