  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, the hickory surface reveals a complex layer of contamination that obscures its natural\
    \ wood grain. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), I observed a heterogeneous film—approximately 10 to 15 µm thick\
    \ in most areas—covering roughly 80% of the scanned region. This layer appears as a patchy, uneven deposit, with darker\
    \ zones suggesting organic residues (likely oils or sap) and lighter, granular patches indicating inorganic dust or particulate\
    \ matter. Surface texture shows significant disruption, with the expected smooth-to-fibrous wood structure hidden beneath\
    \ this crust.\n\nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis points to high carbon and oxygen content in the darker\
    \ zones, supporting the organic residue hypothesis, while silica and calcium peaks suggest environmental dust in the lighter\
    \ areas. Surface roughness, measured via profilometry, yields an Ra value of 3.2 µm, much higher than expected for untreated\
    \ hickory. That’s a clear sign of compromised integrity. Under this magnification, micro-cracks—some as wide as 2 µm—are\
    \ also visible, likely exacerbated by the contamination trapping moisture or stressing the wood’s porous structure (about\
    \ 55% porosity, typical for hickory). These observations highlight how the surface is far from its optimal state for applications\
    \ like aerospace or cultural heritage restoration."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the hickory surface at 500x magnification presents a striking transformation when viewed\
    \ through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The previously dominant contamination layer—once 10 to 15 µm thick—has been\
    \ reduced to negligible traces, with over 95% of the surface now exposing the natural wood grain. The grain structure,\
    \ fibrous and intricate, is clearly visible, showing the characteristic cellular patterns of hickory with minimal obstruction.\
    \ Surface roughness, re-measured via profilometry, drops significantly to an Ra value of 0.8 µm, a marked improvement\
    \ from the pre-cleaned 3.2 µm, indicating a smoother, more uniform finish that’s better suited for functional performance.\n\
    \nEDX analysis confirms the removal of most organic residues and inorganic particulates, with carbon and oxygen signals\
    \ now aligning with expected wood composition rather than contamination peaks. Reflectivity, tested at 1064 nm wavelength,\
    \ increases slightly from 0.12 to 0.15 (dimensionless), suggesting a cleaner surface with less light absorption by deposits.\
    \ Micro-cracks, previously noted at 2 µm wide, appear less pronounced—perhaps due to the removal of trapped debris—though\
    \ some persist as inherent wood features. This cleaning, carried out with laser fluence just above the ablation threshold\
    \ of 1.8 J/cm², preserves surface integrity while enhancing suitability for demanding applications like automotive or\
    \ aerospace components.\n\nLooking closer, the cleaned surface shows occasional residual specks—maybe 0.5 µm or so in\
    \ diameter—but these are isolated and don’t impact overall quality. The porosity (still around 55%) remains unchanged,\
    \ as expected, since laser cleaning targets surface layers without altering bulk properties. This method enables effective\
    \ restoration while maintaining the wood’s natural characteristics, setting up improved adhesion for coatings or finishes\
    \ in practical use. It’s a solid outcome, especially when you figure out how contamination once masked the material’s\
    \ potential for high-performance environments."
