caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the hickory surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    embedded particulate matter, dried organic residues, and micro-fractures filled
    with foreign substances. The contaminants disrupt the natural wood anatomy, filling
    the large vessel elements and porous structure characteristic of hickory''s 55%
    porosity.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination forming a crust that
    bridges across the grain. This layer masks the underlying cellular detail, including
    the distinctive rays and dense fiber structure. The contaminants exhibit poor
    adhesion to the substrate in some areas, creating pockets and delamination zones
    that compromise surface integrity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals a complete restoration
    of the hickory''s native surface topography. The porous, open-grain structure
    is now fully exposed, with vessel elements and medullary rays clearly defined
    and free of occluding debris. The laser process has selectively removed the contamination
    layer without damaging the underlying wood substrate.


    The cellular structure exhibits no thermal degradation, with sharp boundaries
    between cell walls. The surface shows a measurable reduction in micro-roughness,
    with the natural grain pattern now clearly visible across the entire specimen.
    The cleaning has achieved sub-micrometer precision in contaminant removal, preserving
    the structural integrity of the hickory fibers while restoring the material''s
    inherent surface characteristics.'
