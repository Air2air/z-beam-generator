        research_basis: Epoxy resin composites exhibit excellent resistance to a wide
          range of chemicals, solvents, and moisture, with degradation primarily limited
          to strong oxidizing acids and certain alkalis. The polymer matrix provides
          a protective barrier, making them superior to metals in most corrosive environments,
          though not as universally resistant as some fluoropolymers.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for standard epoxy
          resins in an air/oxidizing environment is typically 130-150°C. Above this
          range, thermal degradation and oxidation processes accelerate, leading to
          significant loss of mechanical properties. The provided material properties
          (85 Shore D hardness, 1000 J·kg⁻¹·K⁻¹ specific heat) are consistent with
          a standard cured epoxy system, supporting this temperature range assessment.

        research_basis: Epoxy resin composites typically exhibit flexural strengths
          in the 80-120 MPa range for standard formulations, though this varies significantly
          with fiber type, fiber content, and filler materials. The provided properties
          (density, hardness) are consistent with typical filled or reinforced epoxy
          composites. While the given properties don't directly predict flexural strength,
          they help confirm this is a standard epoxy composite material where 3-point
          bend testing commonly yields values in this range.

        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, "Properties of Epoxy Matrix
          Composites"'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of epoxy resin composites is highly
          dependent on the type and volume fraction of reinforcing fibers (e.g., carbon,
          glass). For a typical structural composite with a moderate fiber volume
          fraction (50-60%), the compressive strength generally falls in the range
          of 80-150 MPa. The provided value of 110 MPa is a representative median
          for a glass/epoxy composite system, which is the most common type. The known
          properties (high hardness, density) are consistent with a filled or reinforced
          epoxy system, but without specific reinforcement details, this is an estimated
          range.

        research_basis: Epoxy resins typically have low fracture toughness (0.5-0.8
          MPa·√m) due to their brittle thermoset nature. While fiber reinforcement
          can significantly improve toughness, the provided properties (density 1.25
          g/cm³, hardness 85 Shore D) suggest an unfilled or minimally filled epoxy
          system, consistent with the lower end of this range. The cited ASM Handbook
          provides characteristic values for unreinforced epoxy polymers.
