  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, surface of epoxy resin composite reveals significant contamination. This layer, it appears\
    \ as uneven, patchy film covering much of the substrate. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), we observe thickness\
    \ of this contamination ranging from approximately 10 µm to—or more precisely—14.5 µm in denser areas. Surface texture\
    \ looks rough and irregular, with visible clusters of particulate matter embedded within organic residues. These particles,\
    \ they seem like dust or industrial debris, showing jagged edges and sizes between 2 µm and 8 µm.\n\nFurther examination\
    \ with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) identifies composition of contamination as mixture of carbon-based residues\
    \ and trace metallic elements, perhaps from manufacturing environment. Surface roughness, measured as Ra value, stands\
    \ at 3.7 µm, indicating high irregularity that could affect adhesion or performance in aerospace applications. This contamination,\
    \ it creates dull, matte appearance under microscope, reducing natural reflectivity of epoxy composite (which should be\
    \ around 0.08 at 1064 nm wavelength). So, first we see this layer obscuring base material, then it becomes clear how it\
    \ impacts functional properties like surface integrity. (I note this aligns with prior observations of industrial composites.)\n\
    \nZooming into specific regions, darker streaks—likely oil or grease residues—spread across surface in irregular patterns,\
    \ almost like web. These streaks, they measure about 20 µm in width at widest points, and under SEM, show smoother texture\
    \ compared to surrounding particulate areas. This combination of organic and inorganic deposits, it suggests prolonged\
    \ exposure to mixed contaminants, very common in automotive or wind energy settings. Surface, it looks compromised, with\
    \ potential for reduced tensile strength (rated at 80 MPa for this material) if not addressed."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, surface of epoxy resin composite at 500x magnification shows remarkable transformation.\
    \ This cleaned area, it now reveals original substrate with contamination layer largely removed. Under SEM, we see residual\
    \ film thickness reduced to less than 1.2 µm in most regions, compared to earlier 10-14.5 µm. Surface texture appears\
    \ much smoother, with Ra value dropping to 0.9 µm, indicating restored uniformity. This change, it looks very clear, almost\
    \ like polished finish, and reflectivity seems closer to material’s natural value (0.08 at 1064 nm).\n\nComparing directly\
    \ to contaminated state, those jagged particles (2-8 µm) and dark streaks (around 20 µm wide) are no longer visible. EDX\
    \ analysis confirms significant reduction in carbon residues and metallic traces, suggesting effective removal of industrial\
    \ debris and organic films. Surface roughness decrease, this improves potential adhesion for coatings or bonding in aerospace\
    \ applications. Also, we observe no apparent thermal damage despite low ablation threshold (1.2 J/cm²) of material—laser\
    \ parameters were well-controlled, it seems. (This matches expected outcomes from similar studies on polymer composites.)\n\
    \nLooking closer, few micro-pits, approximately 3 µm in diameter, remain in isolated spots, likely from laser interaction\
    \ at higher energy points. Yet, overall integrity of epoxy surface, it appears intact, with no cracking or charring that\
    \ could compromise tensile strength (80 MPa) or hardness (85 Shore D). This cleaned surface, it shows restored functional\
    \ quality, very important for performance in demanding environments like wind energy structures. So, first contamination\
    \ obscured material, now we see clear substrate, ready for use."
