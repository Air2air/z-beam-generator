caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated epoxy composite surface reveals a non-uniform layer of organic and
    particulate debris, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This contamination obscures the underlying polymer matrix, presenting
    as a discontinuous film with a mottled, textured appearance.


    The surface topography is dominated by agglomerated particles, ranging from sub-micrometer specks to clusters up to 20
    micrometers across, embedded within a carbonaceous film. This layer introduces significant surface roughness, measured
    at approximately 3.5 µm Ra, which is a substantial increase from the substrate''s native 0.8 µm Ra. The original molded
    surface texture of the epoxy is completely masked by this adherent, irregular coating.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification shows a complete restoration of the original epoxy
    composite substrate. The contamination layer has been entirely removed through a process of controlled ablation, revealing
    the homogeneous, fiber-reinforced polymer matrix beneath.


    The surface roughness has been reduced to near-original levels, measuring 0.9 µm Ra, indicating minimal substrate alteration.
    The cleaning process has successfully eliminated all particulate contamination and carbonaceous residues without inducing
    thermal damage, such as melting or charring, to the underlying polymer. The resulting surface presents the characteristic
    molded texture of the composite, free from residual contaminants.'
