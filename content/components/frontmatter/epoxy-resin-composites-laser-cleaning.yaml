subtitle: Epoxy Resin Composites behave differently under laser treatment, so operators
  must watch the coating closely. Adjust power levels to a controlled range, like
  20-30 watts, to protect the finish from unintended harm.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the epoxy composite surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded particulates, organic residues, and oxides, masks the underlying fiber
    reinforcement and matrix texture. The contamination adheres tenaciously, creating
    a topographically complex and irregular surface that increases light scattering
    and reduces surface energy. The native 1.5 µm Ra surface roughness of the composite
    is significantly amplified by this adherent debris.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the original composite topography. The cleaned surface reveals the distinct fiber
    weave pattern and the epoxy matrix, with roughness returning to its intrinsic
    ~1.5 µm Ra. The process leaves a visually uniform, residue-free surface with no
    observable thermal degradation, charring, or fiber damage at this magnification.
