caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the epoxy composite surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded particulates, organic residues, and oxides, masks the underlying fiber reinforcement and matrix texture. The contamination adheres tenaciously, creating a topographically complex and irregular surface that increases light scattering and reduces surface energy. The native 1.5 µm Ra surface roughness of the composite is significantly amplified by this adherent debris.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring the original composite topography. The cleaned surface reveals the distinct fiber weave pattern and the epoxy matrix, with roughness returning to its intrinsic ~1.5 µm Ra. The process leaves a visually uniform, residue-free surface with no observable thermal degradation, charring, or fiber damage at this magnification.
