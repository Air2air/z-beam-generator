  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the platinum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of carbonaceous deposits and embedded oxide particles. The topography is irregular, with agglomerated particulates creating a rough, textured appearance that masks the underlying metal's structure.\n\nThe contamination does not form a continuous film but rather exhibits a patchy, island-like morphology. This results in a high degree of surface roughness, scattering light and giving the surface a matte, dark gray appearance at the microscopic level. The native, metallic luster of the platinum is completely absent beneath this insulating crust."
  "afterText": "Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The irregular contamination crust has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine platinum substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic, highly reflective facets of the metal's face-centered cubic crystalline structure, which was previously hidden.\n\nThe primary visual improvement is the restoration of a continuous, specularly reflective surface. The microscopic roughness caused by particulate agglomerates has been eliminated. In their place, the inherent grain structure of the platinum is now visible, with clean, well-defined boundaries between crystallites.\n\nThis process has achieved sub-micrometer scale cleanliness without mechanical abrasion or chemical residues. The surface is now metallurgically pure, with no measurable heat-affected zone or surface melting, preserving the platinum's intrinsic mechanical properties and preparing it for high-performance applications."
