caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the platinum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    carbon deposits, embedded particulate matter, and areas of tenacious oxide scale,
    despite platinum's inherent oxidation resistance. The underlying metal's FCC crystalline
    structure is entirely hidden. The texture is highly irregular, with contamination
    filling the natural grain boundaries and creating a topographically complex, matte
    surface that scatters light and severely diminishes thermal and electrical conductivity
    at the interface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine platinum substrate, restoring its
    intrinsic metallic luster. The surface now exhibits a clean, defined grain structure
    with visible annealing twins, characteristic of its FCC lattice. Contaminants
    are completely removed from the grain boundaries, resulting in a microscopically
    smooth finish that optimizes the surface for electrical contact and catalytic
    activity.
