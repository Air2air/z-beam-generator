  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the platinum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, measuring
    5-15 micrometers thick, consists of carbonaceous deposits and embedded oxide particles. The topography is irregular, with
    agglomerated particulates creating a rough, textured appearance that masks the underlying metal''s structure.


    The contamination does not form a continuous film but rather exhibits a patchy, island-like morphology. This results in
    a high degree of surface roughness, scattering light and giving the surface a matte, dark gray appearance at the microscopic
    level. The native, metallic luster of the platinum is completely absent beneath this insulating crust.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The irregular contamination
    crust has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine platinum substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic,
    highly reflective facets of the metal''s face-centered cubic crystalline structure, which was previously hidden.


    The primary visual improvement is the restoration of a continuous, specularly reflective surface. The microscopic roughness
    caused by particulate agglomerates has been eliminated. In their place, the inherent grain structure of the platinum is
    now visible, with clean, well-defined boundaries between crystallites.


    This process has achieved sub-micrometer scale cleanliness without mechanical abrasion or chemical residues. The surface
    is now metallurgically pure, with no measurable heat-affected zone or surface melting, preserving the platinum''s intrinsic
    mechanical properties and preparing it for high-performance applications.'
