        research_basis: Platinum is considered one of the most corrosion-resistant
          metals, essentially inert to air, water, and single acids at all temperatures.
          It exhibits exceptional resistance to oxidation, even at high temperatures,
          and is unaffected by most common corrosive environments, including those
          that attack noble metals like gold.

        research_basis: Platinum is one of the most oxidation-resistant metals. It
          does not form a stable oxide (platinum oxide decomposes around 500-600 °C).
          The limit of ~1000 °C in air is not due to catastrophic oxidation but to
          a slow, continuous loss of material through the formation of volatile PtO₂,
          which becomes significant at this temperature. Below this, it is considered
          highly stable.

        research_basis: Platinum is a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal with high ductility,
          resulting in relatively low flexural strength compared to its compressive
          strength. The provided value is a typical flexural strength for annealed,
          high-purity platinum based on standardized bend tests. The value is consistent
          with its low hardness (41 HV) and known mechanical behavior, where yield
          strength is typically in the range of 110-165 MPa.

        research_basis: Platinum is a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal with high ductility,
          and pure metals in this group typically do not have a definitive compressive
          strength as they yield and deform plastically rather than fracture. The
          provided range represents the compressive yield strength (typically at 0.2%
          offset) for annealed, high-purity platinum, which is highly dependent on
          purity, grain size, and prior work hardening. The value is derived from
          the material's known tensile behavior and hardness correlation, as compressive
          strength for such ductile metals is generally similar to tensile strength.
