caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the platinum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of carbonaceous
    deposits, adsorbed atmospheric compounds, and fine particulate matter. The underlying
    platinum's metallic luster is absent, replaced by a matte, topographically complex
    surface. Contaminants fill the native grain structure, creating a smeared, occluded
    appearance that masks the true substrate. The surface exhibits poor reflectivity
    due to this light-scattering layer.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a
    complete transformation. The contamination layer has been entirely removed via
    selective laser ablation, exposing the pristine, polycrystalline platinum substrate.
    The metal's characteristic grain boundaries are now clearly defined, and the surface
    exhibits its inherent metallic reflectivity. Minor, sub-micron surface texturing
    from the laser process is visible, but without thermal damage or alteration to
    the bulk material's microstructure. The surface is restored to a clean, metallurgically
    intact state.
