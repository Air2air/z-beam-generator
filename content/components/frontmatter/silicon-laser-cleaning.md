headline: "Comprehensive technical guide for laser cleaning semiconductor silicon"
description: "Laser cleaning of silicon utilizes pulsed laser irradiation to selectively remove contaminants through rapid thermal ablation and vaporization, without damaging the underlying Si substrate. This non-contact process is critical in semiconductor manufacturing for precision cleaning of wafers, solar cells, and MEMS devices. Key technical advantages include superior selectivity, no chemical waste, and the ability to automate for high-throughput production lines."
