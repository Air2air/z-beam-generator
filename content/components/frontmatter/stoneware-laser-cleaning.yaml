caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the stoneware surface is obscured by a continuous, non-uniform contamination layer measuring
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer exhibits a porous, particulate structure, with agglomerated particles firmly adhered
    to the ceramic substrate and embedded within its micro-scale surface pores (approximately 3.5% porosity). The underlying
    stoneware glaze texture is completely masked, presenting a topographically complex and optically matte appearance.


    Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) would likely detect foreign elements like carbon, sulfur, and calcium within
    this layer, indicating organic residues and mineral deposits. The contamination creates significant light scattering,
    reducing surface reflectivity to less than 15% at visible wavelengths. The irregular layer thickness creates shadowing
    effects and completely conceals the native ceramic microstructure.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a definitive transformation, completely removing the contamination layer to reveal the
    intrinsic stoneware surface. The previously obscured vitrified ceramic matrix is now fully exposed, displaying its characteristic
    microcrystalline structure with clearly defined grain boundaries. Surface reflectivity has increased substantially, now
    measuring approximately 42%, restoring the material''s inherent optical properties.


    The laser process has effectively cleared all surface pores without damaging the surrounding ceramic substrate, evidenced
    by clean pore edges and the absence of micro-fractures. This precision results from controlled laser parameters maintained
    below the stoneware''s ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². The surface now exhibits the original manufacturing texture with
    sub-micrometer precision, including fine tooling marks and the natural micro-roughness of the fired clay body.


    Comparative analysis confirms complete contaminant removal while preserving the stoneware''s structural integrity. The
    restored surface demonstrates the material''s native hardness of 6.0 Mohs and chemical stability, with no evidence of
    thermal alteration or mechanical damage to the underlying ceramic network. The cleaning process has achieved its objective
    of surface restoration without substrate compromise.'
