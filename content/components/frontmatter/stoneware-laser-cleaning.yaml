caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stoneware surface is obscured by a dense,
    irregular contamination layer measuring 15-50 µm thick. This layer exhibits a
    complex topography of particulate agglomerates and amorphous deposits, which fill
    the inherent micro-porosity of the ceramic body. The contaminants create a discontinuous,
    textured crust that masks the underlying vitrified ceramic structure and its characteristic
    surface morphology.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination crust, revealing
    the original stoneware substrate. The surface now displays the intrinsic micro-texture
    of the vitrified ceramic, characterized by a network of fine, interlocking crystalline
    phases and a low, approximately 3.5%, porosity. The laser process has successfully
    ablated the foreign material without inducing micro-fractures or significant alteration
    to the primary mineral matrix.


    The ablation threshold was precisely controlled to remain below the 2.8 J/cm²
    damage threshold of the stoneware, ensuring selective removal. This has restored
    the material''s original reflectivity of approximately 15% and exposed its uniform,
    grain-like structure. The cleaned surface demonstrates the efficacy of laser parameters
    tuned to the material''s specific thermal diffusivity (0.85 mm²/s) and absorption
    characteristics, resulting in a contaminant-free interface ready for further analysis
    or protective coating.'
