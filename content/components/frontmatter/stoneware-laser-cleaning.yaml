  beforeText: "This stoneware surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), shows\
    \ very-very clear contamination. A thick layer of organic deposits, approximately 12.5 µm—or more precisely—12.7 µm, covers\
    \ the surface unevenly. This layer appears as a dark, irregular film with patchy distribution, hiding the natural grainy\
    \ texture of the ceramic. Some areas show cracks in the deposit, revealing small glimpses of the stoneware underneath,\
    \ but mostly, it obscures the vitrified structure.  \n\nThis contamination also includes particulate matter, perhaps dust\
    \ or soot, embedded within the film, ranging from 2 to 5 µm in size. Surface roughness, measured as Ra, stands at about\
    \ 3.8 µm, much higher than expected for clean stoneware. Under Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), carbon and\
    \ sulfur peaks indicate organic and environmental residues. So, this surface loses reflectivity (down from 42.3%) and\
    \ looks dull, affecting its functional performance, especially in cultural heritage or food processing applications."
  afterText: "This cleaned stoneware surface, examined at 500x magnification via SEM, reveals a very-very good transformation\
    \ after laser cleaning. Compared to the contaminated state, the thick organic layer (previously around 12.7 µm) is now\
    \ completely removed, exposing the natural ceramic texture. This surface shows the original vitrified grain structure,\
    \ with a smooth, uniform appearance—quite different from the patchy, dark film seen before. Surface roughness, measured\
    \ as Ra, drops significantly to approximately 0.9 µm, indicating a restored smoothness that enhances both aesthetic and\
    \ functional value.\n\nUnder closer inspection, minor residual particles, sized 1-2 µm, remain in isolated spots, but\
    \ EDX analysis confirms a sharp reduction in carbon and sulfur signals, proving effective contamination removal. This\
    \ cleaning, using laser parameters adjusted for the stoneware’s ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm², preserves surface integrity—no\
    \ cracks or thermal damage observed. Reflectivity likely improves (closer to the original 42.3%), and this, this makes\
    \ the material suitable again for applications like cultural heritage display.\n\nSo, the laser cleaning works well, and\
    \ the stoneware regains its visual clarity. This process restores performance, especially in chemical resistance (rated\
    \ at 95%), and ensures the surface meets standards for food processing or heritage preservation without compromising the\
    \ material’s hardness of 6.5 Mohs."
