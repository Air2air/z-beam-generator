        research_basis: Stoneware is a vitrified ceramic with very low porosity (<3%),
          making it highly resistant to water, chemicals, and environmental weathering.
          Its corrosion resistance is superior to earthenware and comparable to porcelain,
          though slightly less chemically inert than some technical ceramics. It demonstrates
          excellent stability against atmospheric corrosion, moisture, and most common
          chemicals except strong acids and alkalis.

        source: American Ceramic Society, "Properties of Stoneware"
        research_basis: Stoneware is a dense, vitrified ceramic fired at high temperatures
          (typically 1200-1300°C). Its maximum service temperature in oxidizing environments
          is generally considered to be its original firing temperature, as it has
          already undergone mineralogical changes and possesses a stable, glassy phase
          that resists further oxidation. Authoritative sources from ceramic societies
          and material databases consistently place this upper limit at approximately
          1200°C for continuous use.

          of Fired Whiteware Materials"
        research_basis: Stoneware is a dense, vitrified ceramic. Its compressive strength
          is significantly higher than its tensile strength. The provided value of
          55 MPa is a typical lower bound for vitrified stoneware bodies, with high-quality
          industrial stoneware often reaching 80-150 MPa. The ASTM standard specifies
          testing on right circular cylinders or cubes, with results highly dependent
          on specimen geometry, loading rate, and the absence of macroscopic flaws.
