description: Vanadium laser cleaning utilizes pulsed fiber lasers at 1064nm wavelength to selectively ablate surface contaminants and oxides from vanadium and its alloys. The process leverages vanadium's moderate thermal conductivity (30.7 W/m·K) and specific absorption characteristics at near-IR wavelengths for precise, non-contact cleaning without altering the base metal's metallurgical properties.
