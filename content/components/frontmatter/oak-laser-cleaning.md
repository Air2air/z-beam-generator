description: Technical overview of Oak, a hardwood known for its durability and aesthetic
  appeal, for laser cleaning. Oak's porous structure and natural color variations
  require precise control of laser parameters to effectively remove surface contaminants
  without damaging the wood's integrity. Laser ablation and cleaning techniques offer
  non-contact solutions for Oak restoration and woodworking applications.
