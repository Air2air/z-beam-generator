description: Technical overview of Lead Crystal, known for its high refractive index
  and brilliance, for laser cleaning. Lead Crystal's unique properties, such as its
  lead oxide content, require careful selection of laser parameters to ensure effective
  cleaning without damaging the material. The use of 1064nm wavelength lasers with
  a fluence of 0.5-5 J/cm² and pulse durations of 10-100ns allows for precise removal
  of contaminants while preserving the integrity and aesthetics of the crystal.
