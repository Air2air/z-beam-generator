caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of a carbonaceous
    film, intermixed with embedded alumina or silicate particles from handling and
    high-temperature service. The underlying rhenium's HCP crystalline structure is
    entirely hidden. The contaminant morphology is complex, displaying a cracked,
    crust-like texture with visible porosity. This layer disrupts the metal's inherent
    thermal and electrical properties, creating a barrier that appears as a topographically
    rough, matte, and dark gray landscape under the microscope, masking the substrate's
    true metallic character.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the pristine rhenium substrate. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallic luster
    with clearly defined grain boundaries from its HCP crystalline structure. The
    removal of the obscuring layer restores the material's native surface texture
    and properties.
