caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the rhenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a matte, textured crust composed of embedded carbonaceous soot and oxide
    particles, creating a topographically complex and rough surface. The underlying metallic substrate is not visible, and
    the contamination exhibits a cracked, mud-flat pattern, indicative of thermal stress and oxidation cycles.


    Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirms the presence of foreign elements, including oxygen and carbon,
    which form a discontinuous but tenacious film. This layer significantly alters the surface''s native properties, masking
    the characteristic, fine-grained microstructure of the rhenium metal beneath it.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is definitive. The thick, matte contamination
    crust has been completely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying rhenium substrate. The surface now exhibits the
    intrinsic, fine-grained polycrystalline structure of the metal, with individual grain boundaries clearly visible.


    The laser process has restored the original metallic luster and surface topography. The previously rough and cracked texture
    has been replaced by a clean, uniform morphology. Analysis confirms the elimination of the oxygen and carbon signals detected
    prior to cleaning, verifying the removal of the oxide and soot layers.


    This restoration to the base metal provides an optimal surface for subsequent processes, such as coating or bonding, by
    ensuring maximum adhesion to the pure rhenium without any intervening contamination. The process successfully ablated
    the contaminants without damaging the high-strength rhenium substrate.'
