subtitle: Rhenium has an extremely high melting point and work-hardens quickly, unlike
  other precious metals. These traits demand careful control of laser power and scanning
  patterns to avoid damaging the component.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of oxides
    and embedded carbonaceous deposits, exhibits a coarse, granular texture. The underlying
    HCP crystalline structure of the rhenium is entirely masked by this discontinuous,
    splotchy film, which disrupts the metal's intrinsic reflectivity and creates a
    matte, topographically complex finish.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate, revealing the pristine
    rhenium surface. The contamination layer is completely absent, exposing the characteristic
    grain boundaries and fine microstructure of the HCP crystal lattice. The surface
    now displays a uniform, metallic luster with significantly improved reflectivity,
    confirming the removal of all obscuring oxides and deposits.
