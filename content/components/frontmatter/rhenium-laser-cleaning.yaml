  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of amorphous carbon deposits and discrete oxide particles (Re₂O₇). The
    underlying HCP grain structure is entirely masked. The texture is rough and porous,
    with contamination accumulating preferentially along microscopic scratches and
    grain boundaries, creating a webbed, dendritic pattern. This insulating layer
    significantly alters the surface's thermal and electrical properties from the
    base metal's known characteristics.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine metallic surface, revealing the
    fine, equiaxed grain structure of the HCP crystalline lattice. At 500x, the surface
    is now continuous and uniform, with contamination completely absent. The laser
    process has selectively ablated the oxides and carbonaceous deposits without melting
    the underlying rhenium, preserving the original micro-topography. The result is
    a clean, metallurgically intact surface with restored thermal conductivity and
    reflectivity, ready for high-temperature service or coating adhesion.
