        research_basis: Rhenium exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to many environments.
          It resists oxidation in air up to 1000°C, shows good resistance to seawater
          and marine atmospheres, and is resistant to hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,
          and sulfuric acid at various concentrations and temperatures. However, it
          can be attacked by oxidizing agents under certain conditions and has susceptibility
          to oxidation at very high temperatures, preventing a perfect 9-10 rating.

        research_basis: Rhenium begins to undergo significant oxidation in air at
          temperatures above 600°C, forming volatile rhenium heptoxide (Re2O7). While
          it can withstand brief exposures to higher temperatures, 600°C is consistently
          cited in authoritative materials handbooks as the maximum temperature for
          continuous service in an oxidizing atmosphere before catastrophic oxidation
          occurs.

        research_basis: The provided flexural strength value for commercially pure,
          powder-metallurgy rhenium is based on 4-point bend test data. Rhenium, while
          extremely hard and possessing a high melting point, has a hexagonal close-packed
          (HCP) crystal structure which can limit its ductility and bending strength
          at room temperature, especially in its unalloyed, sintered form. This value
          represents a typical range for the material in a wrought and recrystallized
          condition.

          The cited table provides a compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) of 150
          ksi, which converts to approximately 1034 MPa. This value is representative
          of annealed, wrought material at room temperature.
