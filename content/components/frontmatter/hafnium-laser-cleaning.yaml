        research_basis: Hafnium exhibits excellent corrosion resistance in a wide
          range of environments, comparable to zirconium. It forms a highly stable,
          adherent oxide film that provides exceptional resistance to corrosion by
          water, steam, alkalis, and many acids, including nitric acid. Its primary
          limitation is susceptibility to corrosion in hydrofluoric acid and strong,
          hot sulfuric acid, which prevents a perfect 10 rating.

        research_basis: ASM Handbook states that hafnium has good oxidation resistance
          up to 400°C in air, but rapid oxidation and embrittlement occur at temperatures
          above approximately 540°C. The 400°C value is cited as the maximum for continuous
          service where oxidation resistance is maintained.

        research_basis: Flexural strength is not a standardly reported property for
          pure hafnium metal, as it is typically characterized by tensile or compressive
          yield strength. The provided value is an engineering estimate derived from
          the relationship between ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and flexural strength
          for ductile metals. Authoritative material data sheets for commercially
          pure hafnium report an ultimate tensile strength in the range of 290-400
          MPa. For a conservative estimate in a bending context, a value near the
          upper end of this range is cited, as the flexural strength of a ductile
          metal is generally similar to or slightly higher than its UTS.

        research_basis: Compressive strength is not a commonly reported property for
          pure, annealed hafnium metal, as it is a ductile material. The provided
          value is a typical compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) for commercially
          pure hafnium, which aligns with its known relationship to tensile strength.
          The hardness value (1760 MPa) is a pressure-based measurement and is significantly
          higher than the macro-scale compressive strength.
