caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the hafnium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of embedded carbonaceous particulates and a discontinuous oxide scale.
    The underlying metal's HCP crystalline structure is entirely concealed. The topography
    is irregular, with contamination accumulating in the micro-valleys of the mechanically
    finished surface, creating a textured, matte appearance that significantly increases
    light scattering and reduces the native metallic luster. This layer compromises
    the material's surface-dependent properties.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a dramatic transformation
    to the pristine hafnium substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via ablation, exposing the native, fine-grained metallic surface. The
    topography now shows the original machining marks and grain boundaries with high
    clarity, free from particulate inclusions. The surface reflectivity has increased
    significantly, measured by a reduction in diffuse light scattering, which is a
    direct result of restoring the metal's inherent 45% reflectivity. This process
    achieves a clean, oxide-controlled surface without mechanical deformation or media
    residue, restoring the material's baseline performance characteristics.
