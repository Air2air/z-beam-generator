caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the hafnium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of a complex
    matrix of embedded carbonaceous particulates and a discontinuous, thermally grown
    oxide scale (HfO₂). The underlying metal's native HCP crystalline structure is
    entirely concealed. The texture is highly irregular, featuring micro-fissures
    and localized spallation sites where thermal stress has compromised the oxide's
    adhesion. Contaminants are not evenly distributed, instead forming dendritic and
    island-like patterns that follow the metal's original grain boundaries, indicating
    preferential diffusion and oxidation pathways.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline grain
    structure of the base hafnium. All contamination layers have been completely removed,
    eliminating the previous texture of micro-fissures and oxide scale. The surface
    now exhibits a uniform, clean metallic finish with clearly defined grain boundaries.
