caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the hafnium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of embedded particulates and a discontinuous oxide scale. The underlying
    metal's HCP crystalline structure is entirely hidden. The topography is irregular,
    with contamination accumulating in the micro-valleys of the machined surface texture,
    creating a matte, dark appearance that significantly increases light absorption
    and scattering. This layer compromises the material's inherent properties and
    provides initiation sites for further corrosion.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the
    native hafnium microstructure. The contamination layer has been completely removed
    via ablation, exposing the fine, uniform grain boundaries of the HCP lattice.
    The surface texture is now defined by the metal's intrinsic micro-topography,
    with a consistent, light-grey metallic lustre. The reflectivity has increased
    to the material's inherent 45-48%, and the surface is free of embedded oxides
    and particulates, restoring the substrate's baseline mechanical and chemical properties.
