caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the hafnium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate matter, creating
    a topographically complex and textured landscape. The underlying hafnium''s metallic structure is completely concealed.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like morphology with visible porosity. This layer disrupts the native surface,
    masking the material''s intrinsic properties and creating potential sites for further corrosion or adhesion failure. The
    surface is visually dominated by the contaminant''s characteristics rather than those of the base metal.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the true hafnium substrate. The surface
    now exhibits the characteristic features of the metal''s hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystalline structure, visible as
    a uniform grain pattern. The prior 5-15 micrometer contaminant layer has been eliminated, restoring the original surface
    topography.


    The process has achieved this through laser ablation, where precisely controlled pulses exceeding the 2.5 J/cm² ablation
    threshold vaporized the contaminants. The high thermal diffusivity of hafnium (22.1 mm²/s) allowed rapid heat dissipation,
    preventing thermal damage to the substrate. This selective removal preserved the base metal''s integrity.


    The resulting surface is a clean, metallically pure interface with minimal micro-scale pitting. This restored surface
    is now optimal for subsequent manufacturing processes, such as coating adhesion or welding, as it provides a consistent,
    contaminant-free foundation with predictable material properties.'
