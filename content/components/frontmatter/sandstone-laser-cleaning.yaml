subtitle: Sandstone's variable porosity and mineral composition make it distinct from
  other sedimentary stones. These variations require careful adjustment of laser settings
  to prevent damage during cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface is obscured by a dense,
    heterogeneous contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This crust, composed
    of carbonaceous particulates, gypsum crystals, and biological growth, fills the
    natural pore network. The original grain structure is largely hidden, with only
    the highest quartz protrusions visible through the amorphous, soiling matrix.
    The surface texture is irregular and roughened by the accreted material.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has removed the opaque contamination crust, fully revealing
    the underlying sandstone microstructure. The interlocking quartz grains, now clearly
    defined, exhibit their original crystalline facets and sharp boundaries. The high
    porosity (18.5%) is restored, with open pore throats visible and free of particulate
    fill. The surface reflectivity has increased from 12% to 38.2% due to the exposure
    of the native mineral substrate. This precise ablation, achieved without thermal
    damage to the quartz grains (Mohs 6.5), preserves the stone's intrinsic mechanical
    integrity.
