caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface is obscured by a dense,
    heterogeneous contamination layer averaging 50-200 µm in thickness. This layer,
    composed of carbonaceous particulates, gypsum crusts, and biological growth, fills
    the natural pore network and intergranular spaces. The original grain-to-grain
    contacts and surface texture of the quartz crystals are no longer visible, masked
    by a continuous, discolored crust that exhibits extensive micro-fissuring.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the original sandstone substrate,
    revealing a well-defined granular microstructure. The contamination layer has
    been completely removed, exposing individual quartz grains with sharp boundaries
    and a clean, interlocking texture. The material''s inherent porosity, with pore
    throats measuring 5-50 µm, is now fully accessible and free of occluding deposits.


    The process has selectively ablated the contaminants while preserving the mineralogical
    integrity of the stone. No thermal damage, such as melting or micro-fracturing
    of the quartz grains (Mohs 6.5), is detectable. The surface reflectivity has increased
    from an estimated 35% to a measured 38.2%, consistent with the inherent optical
    properties of clean quartz-rich sandstone. The ablation mechanism relied on the
    differential absorption of laser energy, successfully removing the crust without
    exceeding the stone''s ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm².'
