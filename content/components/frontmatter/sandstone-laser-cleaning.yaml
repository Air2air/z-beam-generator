caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface is obscured by a dense, heterogeneous contamination layer approximately
    20-50 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot and mineral dust, embedded
    within a matrix of organic compounds and sulfate crusts. The original grain structure of the sandstone is largely hidden,
    with only the tallest quartz grain peaks protruding through the contamination.


    The surface exhibits a cracked, crust-like morphology, with the contaminant filling the natural porosity and micro-fractures
    of the stone. This layer creates a continuous film that masks the stone''s inherent texture and mineralogical features.
    The visual effect is a loss of surface definition and a uniform darkening, which alters the stone''s natural appearance
    and compromises its substrate integrity.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine mineralogical surface.
    The original grain-to-grain boundaries and the stone's inherent porosity are now fully exposed and clearly defined. The
    surface texture has been restored to its natural state, characterized by the distinct, interlocking quartz grains and
    a clean, open pore network. This reveals the true, unaltered substrate without mechanical or chemical alteration to the
    stone itself.
