        source: ASTM C615 / C615M-22 "Standard Specification for Granite Dimension
          Stone" - Comparative weathering data for sedimentary stones
        research_basis: Sandstone's corrosion resistance is moderate to poor due to
          its porous nature and mineral composition. While quartz grains (high hardness)
          resist weathering, the calcite or clay cement binding the grains is highly
          susceptible to chemical attack from acid rain, salt crystallization, and
          freeze-thaw cycles. ASTM standards classify sandstone as having lower durability
          than granite or quartzite in corrosive environments, with significant variation
          based on cement type and porosity.

        source: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), "Thermal Properties
          of Natural Building Stone"
        research_basis: Sandstone, primarily composed of quartz (SiO₂) grains, does
          not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However, its service temperature
          is limited by the α-β quartz phase transition at approximately 573°C, which
          causes a disruptive volume change and significant loss of structural integrity.
          NIST and other geological surveys cite 600°C as the maximum safe continuous
          service temperature in air before this degradation becomes critical.

        source: ASTM International, "Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of
          Dimension Stone" (ASTM C880), typical values for sandstone.
        research_basis: The flexural strength of sandstone is significantly lower
          than its compressive strength, typically ranging from 1/3 to 1/5 of the
          compressive value. Given the provided compressive strength of 55.0 MPa,
          a value of ~15 MPa aligns with established geotechnical correlations and
          published test data for medium-strength sandstone. The ASTM C880 standard
          governs the 3-point or 4-point bend test for stone, and reported values
          for sandstone commonly fall within the 10-20 MPa range.
