description: Technical overview of Redwood, a softwood with excellent workability,
  for laser cleaning. Redwood's natural resistance to decay and insects makes it ideal
  for outdoor applications. Laser cleaning can effectively remove surface contaminants
  like mold, mildew, and old finishes without damaging the wood's structure. This
  method is particularly useful in restoration projects where maintaining the original
  material's integrity is crucial.
