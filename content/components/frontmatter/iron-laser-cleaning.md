description: Iron, symbolized as Fe, is a fundamental metal widely used across various
  industries due to its robust mechanical properties and affordability. In laser cleaning
  applications, Iron benefits from laser ablation techniques that involve the precise
  removal of surface contaminants like rust and corrosion without compromising the
  structural integrity of the material. The effectiveness of laser cleaning on Iron
  is maximized when using a pulsed fiber laser at a wavelength of 1064nm, which efficiently
  interacts with the metal's surface to achieve optimal cleaning results.
