caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the slate surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous, amorphous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres
    to the natural cleavage planes. This layer, composed of carbonaceous particulates,
    gypsum crystals, and biological growth, creates a rough, porous topography. The
    underlying slate's characteristic foliated texture and mineral grains are entirely
    masked by this accreted matrix, which exhibits extensive micro-fracturing.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the slate''s intrinsic microstructure.
    The 50-200 micrometer contamination crust has been completely removed, revealing
    the pristine, lamellar texture of the cleavage planes. At 500x, the surface now
    exhibits sharp, well-defined grain boundaries and the subtle sheen of aligned
    phyllosilicate minerals. The process has eliminated the porous, fractured matrix
    without inducing thermal damage, as evidenced by the absence of micro-cracking
    or vitrification.


    The laser''s selective ablation, operating below the slate''s 1.8 J/cm² ablation
    threshold for the substrate, preferentially removed the lower-thermal-inertia
    contaminants. This leaves a clean, mineralogically intact surface with a porosity
    of 1.2%. The result is a surface defined by its natural geological features, where
    the contrast between different mineral components is clearly visible and the original
    surface roughness is preserved, ensuring no alteration to the material''s historic
    or structural character.'
