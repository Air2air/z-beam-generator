    description: Compressive strength in slate is the maximum axial stress it can
      withstand before failure. This property is highly anisotropic, being strongest
      perpendicular to the cleavage plane (slaty cleavage) due to the parallel alignment
      of platy minerals like clay, mica, and chlorite. Strength is governed by mineral
      composition, grain interlocking, and the density of microcracks along the foliation.
