caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the slate surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. This stratum, measuring 10-50 micrometers thick, consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological films. The contaminants fill the natural
    micro-fissures and cleavage planes, creating a discontinuous, textured crust.
    This layer adheres to the substrate, masking the slate's inherent granularity
    and reducing its surface porosity from a nominal 1.2% to near zero.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis reveals the complete removal of the contamination
    crust. The laser ablation process has restored the slate's original micro-topography,
    exposing the fine-grained phyllosilicate matrix and distinct cleavage planes.
    The surface now exhibits its inherent 1.2% porosity, with micro-fissures clear
    of debris. The substrate is intact, with no evidence of thermal damage or micro-fracturing
    from the laser process.
