description: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a highly complex material used extensively in
  semiconductor manufacturing and aerospace industries for its robust properties.
  Laser cleaning of SiC involves precise control of fluence, pulse duration, and wavelength
  to ensure effective removal of surface contaminants without damaging the material's
  microstructure. This process is critical for applications requiring high thermal
  conductivity, hardness, and resistance to extreme temperatures, making it a preferred
  choice for high-performance applications.
