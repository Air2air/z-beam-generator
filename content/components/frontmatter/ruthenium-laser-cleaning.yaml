caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and localized oxide patches, which form irregular,
    dendritic patterns across the substrate. The underlying metal's characteristic
    HCP crystalline structure and fine machining marks are entirely masked. The contaminants
    create a topographically complex and optically matte surface, significantly increasing
    light scattering and reducing the material's inherent 65% reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine ruthenium surface, revealing the
    substrate's true microstructure at 500x magnification. The contamination layer
    is completely ablated, exposing the fine, parallel striations from the original
    machining process and the uniform grain boundaries of the HCP crystalline structure.
    The surface is now continuous and topographically even, with no evidence of thermal
    damage or melting, confirming the process remained below the 2607 K thermal destruction
    point. This results in a specular, highly reflective finish consistent with the
    metal's intrinsic properties.
