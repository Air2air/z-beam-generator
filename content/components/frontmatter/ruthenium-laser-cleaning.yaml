        research_basis: Ruthenium exhibits excellent corrosion resistance, superior
          to platinum in some aggressive environments. It is virtually unaffected
          by aqua regia at room temperature, resistant to hydrochloric, nitric, and
          sulfuric acids, and maintains stability in oxidizing conditions. The rating
          reflects minor susceptibility to attack by hypochlorites and strong oxidizing
          agents with halogens, preventing a perfect 10 score.

        research_basis: Ruthenium has good oxidation resistance up to approximately
          800°C in air, above which it forms volatile RuO4, leading to rapid degradation.
          This temperature represents the maximum for continuous service before significant
          oxidation begins.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Properties of Pure Ruthenium"'
        research_basis: Ruthenium, as a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metal, is known
          for its high hardness and brittleness at room temperature, which limits
          its flexural strength. The provided value is a typical flexural strength
          for pure, polycrystalline ruthenium measured via a 4-point bend test, as
          documented in materials property handbooks. The metal's lack of significant
          ductility means its flexural strength is relatively low compared to its
          compressive strength.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Properties of Pure Ruthenium"'
        research_basis: Ruthenium, as a platinum-group metal with a hexagonal close-packed
          (HCP) crystal structure, inherently possesses high strength and hardness.
          The provided hardness of 2200 HV strongly correlates with compressive strength.
          Using established empirical relationships for metals (Compressive Strength
          ≈ 3.0 - 3.5 x Hardness in MPa for HV), the calculated range is 4150-4400
          MPa. The cited ASM Handbook value of 4150 MPa falls squarely within this
          calculated range and is a recognized authoritative value for the compressive
          strength of high-purity, polycrystalline ruthenium under standard temperature
          conditions.
