caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 2-5 µm thick. This layer, composed of oxides
    and embedded carbonaceous particulates, creates a topographically complex and
    textured surface. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden, with visible
    micro-cracking and a general loss of surface definition due to the pervasive,
    matte-finish coating.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the pristine,
    polycrystalline grain structure of the ruthenium substrate. The surface now exhibits
    high reflectivity and a well-defined, clean micro-topography. The process eliminates
    surface oxides and particulates without inducing micro-fractures, restoring the
    intrinsic metallic luster and sharp grain boundaries of the base material.
