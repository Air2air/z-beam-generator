caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and localized oxide films, which form irregular, blotchy
    patterns across the substrate. The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely
    masked. The contaminant morphology is porous and loosely adhered, creating a topographically
    complex and textured surface that scatters light, giving it a matte, dark appearance
    and compromising its functional properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, polycrystalline grain
    structure of the ruthenium substrate. The surface is now continuous and smooth,
    with clearly defined grain boundaries. This restoration of the native metallic
    surface results in a characteristically high reflectivity, with a mirror-like
    finish evident at the microscopic level.
