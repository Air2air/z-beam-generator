caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zirconium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of embedded carbonaceous soot, oxide scale, and particulate matter. The
    underlying metal's HCP crystalline structure is entirely hidden. The texture is
    rough and irregular, with contamination filling the natural micro-valleys of the
    substrate, creating a matte, light-absorbing appearance that compromises the material's
    intrinsic surface properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, exposing the bare zirconium substrate with its characteristic
    metallic luster. At 500x, the surface exhibits a clean, uniform texture with clearly
    defined grain boundaries. The process has restored the original topography without
    inducing surface melting or ablation, leaving a pristine, contaminant-free finish
    ideal for subsequent high-integrity applications.

subtitle: Pay attention to Zirconium’s stubborn oxide layer during laser treatment.
  Getting the power controls just right, around 50-60 watts, is very-very important
  to protect its surface without causing unwanted pitting or cracks.
