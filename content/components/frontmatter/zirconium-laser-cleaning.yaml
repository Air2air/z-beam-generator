          in *ASM Handbook, Volume 13B: Corrosion: Materials*'
        research_basis: Zirconium exhibits excellent corrosion resistance due to a
          tenacious, protective oxide film. It performs exceptionally well in a wide
          range of aggressive environments, including strong mineral and organic acids,
          alkaline solutions, and saline environments. Its primary limitation is susceptibility
          to localized corrosion in hydrofluoric acid and certain oxidizing chlorides,
          but its general environmental corrosion resistance is considered outstanding,
          justifying a near-top rating.

          and Zirconium Alloys"'
        research_basis: Zirconium forms a protective oxide layer, but this protection
          is lost at elevated temperatures in air. The ASM Handbook and other authoritative
          sources (e.g., "Corrosion of Zirconium and Its Alloys" in Uhlig's Corrosion
          Handbook) consistently report that significant, breakaway oxidation begins
          in the range of 500-600°C, with 540°C often cited as a conservative maximum
          for continuous service in air. Above this temperature, the oxide layer cracks
          and spalls, leading to rapid metal degradation.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with commercially pure zirconium. Authoritative materials databases (ASM,
          AZoMaterials) report flexural/yield strength for annealed Zr typically in
          the range of 270-415 MPa. The cited value of 345 MPa is a representative
          mid-range value from standardized 3-point and 4-point bend test data for
          pure zirconium in the annealed condition, which is the most common state
          for reporting baseline mechanical properties.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of commercially pure zirconium (e.g.,
          Grade 702) is typically reported in the range of 827-828 MPa (120 ksi) at
          room temperature. This value is derived from standard mechanical testing
          procedures for metals and is well-documented in materials handbooks for
          zirconium's condition as an annealed, wrought product.
