caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the serpentine surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous crust, measuring 15-45 micrometers thick,
    adheres to the substrate. This layer comprises particulate matter, carbonaceous
    deposits, and biological films, which fill the natural micro-fissures and intergranular
    boundaries of the stone. The contamination creates a textured, matte topography
    that masks the intrinsic crystalline structure and polish of the serpentine, significantly
    altering its visual and tactile properties.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the microscopic view reveals a complete restoration
    of the serpentine''s intrinsic surface morphology. The 15-45 micrometer contamination
    crust has been entirely removed, exposing the underlying mineral grains and their
    interlocking texture. The laser process has successfully cleared all particulate
    matter and biological films from the intergranular boundaries and micro-fissures
    without inducing mechanical abrasion or sub-surface damage.


    The surface now displays the characteristic flaky, plate-like structure of serpentine
    minerals, with individual crystallites clearly defined. The cleaning has restored
    the stone''s original light-reflective qualities, transitioning the surface from
    a matte, obscured state to one with a defined micro-topography. This precise ablation
    of contaminants preserves the stone''s structural integrity, as confirmed by the
    absence of micro-fracturing or thermal alteration halos around the grain boundaries.
    The result is a surface that is chemically and physically stable, ready for further
    conservation treatment or long-term preservation.'
