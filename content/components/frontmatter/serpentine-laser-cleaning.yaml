        research_basis: Serpentine stones (commercially known as "verde antique" or
          serpentinite marble) are recognized in dimension stone standards for good
          to excellent weathering resistance and durability. While not completely
          inert, serpentine's low porosity and mineral composition provide high resistance
          to atmospheric corrosion, salt spray, and environmental pollutants compared
          to other natural stones. Its main vulnerability is acid attack, which is
          less common in general environmental exposure.

        research_basis: Serpentine minerals (e.g., chrysotile) are hydrous silicates
          that begin to dehydroxylate (lose structural water) around 500-600°C in
          air, which is the primary oxidation/decomposition mechanism rather than
          reaction with oxygen. The 500°C threshold represents the maximum continuous
          service temperature before significant structural breakdown and mass loss
          begins.

        research_basis: The provided value is based on a 4-point bend test of massive
          serpentinite rock (antigorite-rich) as reported in USGS geological and engineering
          property compilations. Flexural strength for serpentine is highly dependent
          on its specific mineralogical composition (e.g., antigorite vs. chrysotile),
          texture, and porosity, leading to a typical range of 15-50 MPa. The cited
          value represents a reliable average for competent, non-fibrous serpentinite
          used as a dimension stone.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of serpentine is highly variable
          (50-300 MPa) depending on mineralogical composition (antigorite vs. chrysotile)
          and anisotropy. The provided value of 170 MPa is a median value for massive,
          blocky serpentinite rock used in construction/dimension stone applications,
          as cited in authoritative geotechnical and stone industry references.
