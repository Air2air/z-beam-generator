caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the brick surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter (soot, dust) embedded in a matrix of organic binders like pollution-derived sulfates and biological growth. The underlying brick texture is masked, with contaminants filling the natural micro-pores and fissures. The surface exhibits a caked, irregular topography that disrupts the original substrate's morphology, creating a non-uniform, occluded appearance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the restoration of the original brick substrate. The contamination layer has been completely removed via laser ablation, exposing the intrinsic micro-structure. The brick's characteristic porosity, with pore diameters ranging from 10-100 µm, is now fully visible and unobstructed. The surface texture is defined by the mineral grains and a clean, sharp interface. The process has selectively eliminated the foreign contaminants without thermal damage to the brick body, as evidenced by the absence of melting, vitrification, or micro-cracking at the grain boundaries. The surface now presents its authentic, unaltered morphology.
