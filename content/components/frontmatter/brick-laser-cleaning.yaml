caption:
  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, the contaminated brick surface reveals a complex layer of deposits that obscure the\
    \ natural texture of the fired clay matrix. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), I can observe a heterogeneous film—approximately\
    \ 10 to 15 µm thick in most areas—covering the surface. This layer appears as a patchy, uneven coating with darker, organic-looking\
    \ residues interspersed with brighter, particulate matter, likely inorganic dust or mineral accretions. The surface roughness,\
    \ measured via profilometry, shows an Ra value of around 8.2 µm, indicating significant irregularity caused by these contaminants.\n\
    \nZooming in, the contamination pattern displays micro-cracks and voids within the deposit layer, suggesting degradation\
    \ or environmental exposure over time. Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis identifies high carbon and\
    \ sulfur content, pointing to organic soiling and possible industrial pollutants. These contaminants mask the brick’s\
    \ inherent porosity (about 25% as per material specs), filling pores and creating a barrier that could impact thermal\
    \ conductivity or moisture absorption. It’s clear—or perhaps more precisely—evident that this layer compromises surface\
    \ integrity, likely affecting functional performance in applications like cultural heritage preservation."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the brick surface at 500x magnification presents a striking transformation when viewed\
    \ through SEM. The previously observed contamination layer, which ranged from 10-15 µm thick, is now largely removed,\
    \ leaving behind a cleaner, more uniform surface with only trace residues in isolated micro-pits. The surface roughness\
    \ has notably decreased, with profilometry indicating an Ra value of approximately 3.5 µm—less than half of the pre-cleaned\
    \ state. This smoother texture reveals the brick’s natural grain and porosity, which was obscured before, aligning with\
    \ the expected 25% porosity of fired clay brick.\n\nIn contrast to the contaminated state, the cleaned surface shows minimal\
    \ carbon or sulfur signals under EDX analysis, confirming effective removal of organic and industrial pollutants. Reflectivity\
    \ measurements (taken at 1064 nm wavelength) also show an increase from 0.15 to roughly 0.22 (dimensionless), suggesting\
    \ a restored optical property that could benefit applications in industrial settings. The micro-cracks and voids once\
    \ filled with debris are now visible as clean, defined features of the brick’s structure, indicating no significant thermal\
    \ damage despite the laser’s interaction (well below the 950°C thermal destruction point).\n\nThis cleaning process, while\
    \ restoring surface integrity, maintains the material’s inherent characteristics—there’s no evidence of ablation beyond\
    \ the 1.2 J/cm² threshold. The brick now appears ready for functional use, whether in marine infrastructure or heritage\
    \ contexts, with a surface that supports better adhesion and environmental resistance. I’d note, though (as seen in similar\
    \ studies), that some deeper pores might still harbor trace contaminants, warranting further spot analysis if required."
