caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the brick surface is dominated by a complex contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers
    thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including carbon soot and mineral dust, embedded within a porous matrix
    of biological growth and salt crystals. The contaminants fill the natural surface pores of the brick, obscuring its intrinsic
    texture and creating a discontinuous, crust-like appearance.


    The underlying brick substrate is only partially visible through this layer. The original surface roughness, measured
    at approximately 15 micrometers (Ra), is masked by the accumulated deposits. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion
    in some areas, showing micro-fissures and delamination, while in other regions it forms a dense, cohesive crust. This
    heterogeneous structure indicates a complex history of environmental exposure and material degradation.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the microscopic view at 500x reveals a complete transformation. The thick, heterogeneous
    contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic mineral structure of the brick substrate. The original
    surface roughness of approximately 15 micrometers (Ra) is now fully visible, characterized by the distinct, open porosity
    typical of fired clay.


    The cleaning process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the underlying brick. The surface now displays
    a clear, uncoated mineral composition. The sharp, well-defined edges of clay particles and a consistent, clean pore network
    are evident, confirming the removal of all foreign material and the restoration of the brick''s original microscopic topography.'
