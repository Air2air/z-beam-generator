description: Marble, composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), is a metamorphic
  rock widely used in construction and restoration due to its aesthetic appeal and
  durability. Laser cleaning of marble involves the use of pulsed lasers at a wavelength
  of 1064nm to remove surface contaminants such as graffiti, stains, and biological
  growth without damaging the underlying material. This non-contact method ensures
  precision and minimal impact on the structural integrity and appearance of the marble,
  making it ideal for both modern and historical applications.
