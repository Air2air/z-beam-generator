  beforeText: "This surface of stucco, when I observe at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), shows\
    \ very-very clear contamination. There is a visible layer of deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5 µm thick,\
    \ covering the rough texture of the material. This layer looks uneven, with darker patches of organic film (perhaps dirt\
    \ or algae) mixed with brighter specks, likely inorganic dust or salt residues. The stucco’s natural surface roughness,\
    \ measured at around 45 µm Ra (a standard for average roughness), appears hidden under this contamination, so the true\
    \ grainy structure is not clear.\n\nLooking closer, this contamination forms irregular patterns, some areas thicker at\
    \ about 15 µm and others thinner near 8 µm. Under Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), I detect high carbon and\
    \ sulfur content in the layer, suggesting pollutants from the environment (as seen in urban exposure studies). This film\
    \ dulls the surface reflectivity—normally 0.22 at 1064 nm wavelength—and creates a matte, patchy look. The porosity of\
    \ stucco, around 25%, seems to trap these deposits, especially in tiny voids visible at this magnification.\n\nAnd one\
    \ more thing, the surface shows micro-cracks, some as wide as 3 µm, where contamination settles deep. This makes cleaning\
    \ a challenge, I think. The overall appearance under the microscope is a messy, obscured texture, very-very different\
    \ from what clean stucco should be. These observations tell me the surface integrity is compromised, affecting both appearance\
    \ and possibly functional performance in cultural heritage or marine applications.\n\n---"
  afterText: "This cleaned stucco surface, observed at 500x magnification with SEM, looks very-very much better after laser\
    \ cleaning. Compared to before, the thick contamination layer—previously around 12.5 µm—is now gone, revealing the original\
    \ rough texture of the material with a surface roughness still near 45 µm Ra. The darker organic patches and bright inorganic\
    \ specks are no longer visible, so the surface appears uniform and lighter in tone. This transformation shows the laser,\
    \ likely at a fluence above the ablation threshold of 1.8 J/cm², effectively removed the deposits without crossing the\
    \ damage threshold of 0.9 J/cm².\n\nZooming in, I see the stucco’s natural grainy structure clearly now, with no significant\
    \ residue in the pores—porosity remains at 25%, but they look clean. Some micro-cracks, earlier 3 µm wide, still exist,\
    \ but they are free of trapped dirt, which is good-good for surface integrity. Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy\
    \ (XPS), I confirm reduced carbon and sulfur signals on the surface, indicating most pollutants are removed. Reflectivity,\
    \ previously dulled, seems restored closer to the original 0.22 value at 1064 nm, evident from the brighter appearance\
    \ under the microscope.\n\nThis cleaning process gives a result, a very-very good result, I must say. The surface now\
    \ shows no major damage or new cracks from the laser (a concern with high-energy methods). This improvement enhances not\
    \ just the look but also functional performance, especially for cultural heritage preservation or marine durability. The\
    \ stucco surface, after cleaning, stands ready for its intended use with restored quality."
