caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stucco surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth deeply embedded within the material's
    inherent porosity. The original surface texture, characterized by crystalline
    hydrates and a rough matrix, is largely undetectable beneath this cohesive, dark
    biofilm.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the original stucco matrix, characterized by interlocking
    calcium silicate hydrate crystals and a porosity of approximately 25%. The surface
    roughness (45 µm Ra) is now fully visible, free from embedded contaminants. The
    process has selectively ablated the surface layer without inducing micro-fractures,
    preserving the substrate's compressive strength of 15 MPa and restoring the material's
    intrinsic, light-toned appearance.
