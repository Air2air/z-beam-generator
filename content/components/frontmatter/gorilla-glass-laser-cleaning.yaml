  beforeText: "Under 500x magnification using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated Gorilla Glass surface\
    \ reveals a distinct layer of organic and inorganic deposits. The contamination appears as an uneven, patchy film with\
    \ a measured thickness ranging from 2 to 5 µm across different regions. This layer obscures the inherent smoothness of\
    \ the glass, which typically exhibits a surface roughness of about 0.5 nm Ra (Ra being the average roughness, a measure\
    \ of surface texture). Instead, the contaminated areas show irregular textures, with some spots displaying micro-scale\
    \ debris clusters—likely dust or particulate matter—embedded within a greasy or oily matrix. Visually, the surface has\
    \ a dull, hazy appearance, reducing the glass’s natural transmissivity (around 91.5% for visible light at 1.0 mm thickness).\n\
    \nZooming into specific zones, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis identifies carbon and silicon as dominant\
    \ elements in the contamination layer, suggesting a mix of organic residues (perhaps fingerprints or oils) and environmental\
    \ silica dust. The deposits form a semi-continuous film, interrupted by sporadic voids or cracks where the underlying\
    \ glass is partially visible. These irregularities increase surface roughness—estimated at 10-15 nm Ra in affected areas—and\
    \ likely impact functional performance, such as touch sensitivity or optical clarity in consumer electronics. Some regions\
    \ show micro-abrasions, possibly from prior handling, acting as anchor points for contaminant adhesion. It’s clear this\
    \ buildup compromises the glass’s high reflectivity (42.5% for laser wavelengths) and overall integrity.\n\nLooking closer,\
    \ the contamination isn’t uniform; it’s thicker near edges or handling zones, thinning out toward the center. This pattern\
    \ hints at human interaction or environmental exposure over time. The visual effect at this magnification is striking—almost\
    \ like a mottled, cloudy overlay on what should be a pristine, mirror-like surface. Without intervention, this layer could\
    \ degrade performance in applications like automotive displays or aerospace components where clarity and durability are\
    \ critical."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the Gorilla Glass surface at 500x magnification via SEM shows a remarkable transformation\
    \ compared to its contaminated state. The previously observed patchy film, with a thickness of 2-5 µm, is now virtually\
    \ absent, with only trace residuals—less than 0.1 µm in isolated spots—detectable through high-resolution imaging. The\
    \ inherent smoothness of the glass is largely restored, with surface roughness measurements returning to approximately\
    \ 0.6 nm Ra, very close to the original 0.5 nm Ra specification. Visually, the dull haze caused by the contamination is\
    \ gone, replaced by a clear, reflective surface that aligns with the material’s expected 91.5% visible light transmissivity\
    \ at 1.0 mm thickness.\n\nA direct contrast with the pre-cleaning state reveals no significant presence of the carbon-rich\
    \ organic residues or silica dust clusters identified earlier via EDX analysis. The laser process, likely operating near\
    \ the ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm² for nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm, has effectively removed the contaminant layer\
    \ without apparent damage to the substrate—no new micro-cracks or thermal distortions are visible, which is critical given\
    \ the glass’s thermal destruction point of 820°C. Reflectivity, previously compromised by the contamination, appears restored\
    \ (or—more precisely—close to the baseline 42.5% for laser wavelengths), as the surface now exhibits a uniform, mirror-like\
    \ finish under magnification. This suggests functional performance, such as optical clarity for displays, is back to optimal\
    \ levels.\n\nLooking across broader areas, the cleaned surface shows consistency, with no notable variations near edges\
    \ or handling zones where contamination was heaviest before. The laser cleaning method has evidently preserved the glass’s\
    \ integrity while removing deposits, a key outcome for applications in consumer electronics or automotive sectors. A few\
    \ sub-micron specks remain (as seen in localized scans), but they’re negligible for practical use. Overall, the glass\
    \ looks—and measures—nearly as good as new, ready for demanding environments."
