        source: Corning Gorilla Glass Technical Materials Sheet
        research_basis: Corning specifically engineers Gorilla Glass with high chemical
          durability, demonstrating exceptional resistance to acids, alkalis, and
          solvents in standardized tests (e.g., 24-hour exposure to 5% HCl results
          in minimal surface weight loss). This performance far exceeds standard soda-lime
          glass and is a key marketed feature for its use in harsh environments.

        research_basis: Corning does not explicitly list an "oxidation resistance
          temperature" for Gorilla Glass. However, the technical data sheet provides
          a "Maximum Continuous Service Temperature" of 600°C. This value represents
          the upper temperature limit for long-term use in air before significant
          property degradation, including oxidation-related effects on the glass surface
          and structure, would be expected to begin.

          Incorporated
        research_basis: Corning's technical documentation for Gorilla Glass 5, which
          is chemically strengthened through an ion-exchange process, specifies a
          flexural strength of 900 MPa when tested using a ring-on-ring (biaxial flexure)
          method. This value is widely cited in industry literature and material databases
          as representative of the glass's bending strength. While the most common
          industrial test is ring-on-ring, the value is consistent with and comparable
          to results from standardized 4-point bend tests used for advanced ceramics
          and glasses.

        research_basis: Corning, the manufacturer, publishes a "typical compressive
          strength" value of 1.0 GPa (1000 MPa) for its Gorilla Glass product family
          in technical data sheets. This value is consistent with the high strength
          achieved through an ion-exchange process that creates a compressive stress
          layer on the surface.
