caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists
    of embedded particulate, hydrocarbon films, and microbial growth, which disrupt
    the polymer's inherent semi-crystalline morphology. The contaminants form dendritic
    patterns, preferentially accumulating in micro-fissures and across the spherulitic
    grain boundaries of the HDPE. This occlusive layer significantly alters surface
    energy and adhesion properties, masking the substrate's true topography and compromising
    its functional performance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the underlying HDPE microstructure
    with high fidelity. The spherulitic crystalline domains, approximately 20-50 µm
    in diameter, are now fully exposed and clearly defined. The laser process has
    restored the native surface texture, eliminating all foreign material without
    inducing macroscopic melting or ablation of the polymer substrate. This results
    in a chemically pure surface with restored interfacial properties.
