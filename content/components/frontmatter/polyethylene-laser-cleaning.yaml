        research_basis: Polyethylene exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range
          of corrosive environments including acids, bases, and salts. It is particularly
          resistant to aqueous solutions, demonstrating minimal degradation even with
          prolonged exposure. However, it has poor resistance to strong oxidizing
          acids and certain organic solvents, and is susceptible to environmental
          stress cracking, preventing a perfect 10 rating.

          (Section 4.2.1, Thermal Properties)'
        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for polyethylene
          is consistently cited in materials handbooks and polymer science references
          as being in the range of 80-85°C. At this temperature, long-term exposure
          leads to significant thermo-oxidative degradation, causing a loss of mechanical
          properties. The lower end of this range (80°C) is the conservative and most
          commonly referenced limit for general-purpose polyethylene.

          and Special-Purpose Materials (ASM International, 1990), Section "Engineering
          Plastics and Elastomers"'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of polyethylene varies significantly
          with its density and molecular structure. For common grades of medium-density
          polyethylene (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which align with
          the provided density of 0.93 g/cm³, typical flexural strength values from
          standardized 3-point bend tests (e.g., ASTM D790) fall in the range of 20-30
          MPa. The cited value of 25 MPa is a representative median for this density
          range, as confirmed by materials property databases and handbooks.

          LDPE) and test conditions (typically at 23°C, 50% RH, strain rate 1-5 mm/min).
          The reported value of ~20 MPa represents a typical range for medium-to-high
          density polyethylene under standard ASTM D695 testing.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness (K_IC) of polyethylene varies significantly
          with molecular weight, crystallinity, and processing conditions. For medium
          to high density polyethylene at room temperature, reported values typically
          range from 1.0 to 4.0 MPa·√m. Higher molecular weight grades achieve the
          upper end of this range, while lower density materials fall toward the lower
          end. The ASM Handbook provides this range as characteristic of polyethylene
          materials.
