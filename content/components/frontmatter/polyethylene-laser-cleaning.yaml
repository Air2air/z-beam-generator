caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and embedded particulates, creates a topographically complex and matte-textured
    landscape. The underlying semi-crystalline polymer structure is entirely masked.
    The contamination adheres tenaciously within the native surface micro-asperities,
    which have a baseline roughness of 0.8 µm Ra, creating a mechanically interlocked,
    high-surface-area interface that compromises substrate integrity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native polymer morphology, revealing
    the characteristic semi-crystalline microstructure of the polyethylene. The contaminant
    layer has been completely ablated, eliminating the previous 5-15 µm thickness.
    The surface now exhibits a uniform texture with a reduced roughness near the intrinsic
    0.8 µm Ra, free from residue and with sharply defined micro-features. This results
    in a clean, low-particulate surface ideal for subsequent processing.

subtitle: Polyethylene often presents a subtle challenge during laser treatment due
  to its varying density across batches. Adjust your power levels with care, ideally
  below 50 watts initially, to protect the delicate outer layer from unintended stress.
