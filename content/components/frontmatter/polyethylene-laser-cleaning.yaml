caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the polyethylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a film of organic residues, creating a
    topographically complex and textured landscape. The surface exhibits a matte, irregular appearance due to light scattering
    from these features.


    The contamination is not a continuous film but forms isolated islands and agglomerates, with some particulate contaminants
    measuring up to 20 micrometers in diameter. These features disrupt the underlying polymer morphology, masking the native
    semi-crystalline structure of the polyethylene. The resulting surface is characterized by high microscopic roughness and
    inconsistent reflectivity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed, revealing the underlying polyethylene substrate with its characteristic semi-crystalline morphology. The surface
    now displays a uniform texture with significantly reduced microscopic roughness.


    The previously obscured polymer structure is now clearly visible, with the laser process restoring the material''s native
    topography. The surface exhibits consistent reflectivity and is free from residual particulate matter, confirming the
    precision of the ablation process which selectively removed contaminants without damaging the base polymer.'
