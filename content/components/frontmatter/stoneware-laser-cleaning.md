description: Technical overview of Stoneware, a ceramic material commonly used in
  ceramics manufacturing and restoration. Stoneware's durability and resistance to
  thermal shock make it an ideal candidate for laser cleaning, allowing for the precise
  removal of contaminants and coatings without damaging the underlying material. This
  non-contact cleaning method is particularly effective for the restoration of historical
  artifacts, ensuring preservation while achieving a thorough clean.
