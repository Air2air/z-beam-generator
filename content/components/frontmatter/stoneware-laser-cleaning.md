description: Stoneware laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to remove surface contaminants while preserving the vitrified ceramic body. The process exploits the differential absorption between contaminants and the stoneware matrix, achieving selective ablation without mechanical contact or chemical residues.
difficultyScore: 3
