caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the soapstone surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous, carbonaceous crust, measuring 50-150 µm
    thick, adheres to the substrate. This crust is porous and exhibits extensive micro-cracking.
    Beneath it, a network of fine, dendritic soot particles penetrates the stone's
    natural micro-pores due to its low hardness (1.0 Mohs). The original talc-dominated
    matrix is largely hidden, with contaminants forming a topographical map of accretion
    and infiltration across the surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate's intrinsic morphology. The
    contamination crust is entirely removed, revealing the undamaged, interlocking
    platelet structure of the talc matrix. The surface is now defined by the stone's
    natural micro-texture, with no residual soot or thermal alteration visible. Pore
    structures are clean and open.

subtitle: Soapstone can be very-very sensitive to high power during laser treatment.
  Adjust your controls to stay below 50 watts at first, ensuring you protect its soft
  layer from unintended wear while removing contaminants.
