          Corning's authoritative datasheet states it has "excellent chemical purity

          and phosphoric," and highly resistant to water and aggressive chemicals,
          leading to a near-perfect rating for general environmental corrosion.

        research_basis: Fused silica is an amorphous form of silicon dioxide (SiO₂),
          which is already in its fully oxidized state. Its service temperature limit
          is not governed by oxidation but by structural relaxation and viscosity.
          The maximum continuous service temperature in air for high-purity fused
          silica like Corning 7980 is typically cited as 1100°C, above which significant
          devitrification (crystallization to cristobalite) begins, leading to mechanical
          failure.

          (2023), Corning Incorporated
        research_basis: Corning, a primary manufacturer of fused silica, provides
          flexural strength data for their HPFS 7980 material. Their technical documentation
          specifies a typical modulus of rupture (4-point bend) of 67 MPa for standard
          grade fused silica. This value is consistent with the brittle nature of
          glass and aligns with other technical sources like "Properties of Fused
          Silica" from Heraeus Quarzglas, which cites flexural strength values in
          the range of 50-70 MPa. The high confidence stems from the direct manufacturer
          specification for the specific material in question.

        source: Corning HPFS® 7980 Fused Silica, Standard Grade Product Information
          (2023)
        research_basis: The compressive strength of fused silica is highly dependent
          on surface quality and test conditions (specimen geometry, loading rate).
          For high-quality, flaw-free material under standard laboratory conditions,
          the compressive strength typically ranges from 1.1 GPa to 1.2 GPa. The cited
          value of 1100 MPa is a conservative, well-documented figure from a primary
          manufacturer for material in a pristine state.
