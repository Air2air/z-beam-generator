caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fused silica surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 0.5–2 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter and a thin film of hydrocarbons, creating a mottled, textured appearance.
    The underlying silica's intrinsic 0.5 nm Ra smoothness is entirely masked. Contaminants
    adhere within the microscopic porosity, forming irregular patterns that scatter
    light and degrade optical performance.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the original fused silica substrate with
    a consistent 0.5 nm Ra surface roughness. At 500x, the surface is now uniform
    and featureless, with no evidence of particulate residue or film-based scattering
    centers.


    The transformation is evident in the restoration of optical clarity. The previously
    mottled texture has been replaced by a pristine, homogeneous plane. The process
    successfully ablated contaminants without inducing micro-fractures or altering
    the surface morphology, as confirmed by the absence of heat-affected zones.


    This results in a surface that meets its specified laser damage threshold of 15
    J/cm² (1064 nm) and exhibits minimal light scatter. The cleaning process leverages
    the material''s high thermal stability and low thermal expansion to achieve removal
    with sub-micron precision, leaving a chemically stable, high-purity surface.'
