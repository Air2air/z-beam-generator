subtitle: Fused Silica presents a unique hurdle due to its variable thermal response.
  Adjust your laser controls carefully during treatment—exceeding 50 watts can cause
  uneven stress on the layer, risking micro-cracks.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fused silica surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 0.5–2 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter and hydrocarbon films, creating a mottled, textured appearance. The contaminants
    disrupt the inherent surface smoothness, scattering light and forming irregular
    patterns that mask the substrate's native structure. This film significantly degrades
    optical transmission and introduces potential sites for laser-induced damage.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals its pristine, amorphous
    structure. The contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser
    ablation, which occurred below the material''s damage threshold of 15 J/cm². The
    original surface roughness of approximately 0.5 nm Ra is now fully restored.


    The transformation is evident in the uniform, featureless topography observed
    at 500x magnification. The process successfully eliminated all particulate and
    film-based contaminants without inducing micro-fractures or subsurface damage.
    This restoration ensures optimal optical performance and mechanical integrity
    for high-precision applications.'
