  beforeText: "At 500x magnification under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated fused silica surface reveals\
    \ a distinct layer of irregular deposits, likely organic or particulate in nature, obscuring the inherent smoothness of\
    \ the material. The contamination appears as a patchy, uneven film with an estimated thickness ranging from 2 to 5 µm\
    \ in denser areas—thicker in some spots, thinner in others. Surface texture shows a marked deviation from the baseline\
    \ roughness of 0.5 nm Ra (a measure of surface smoothness), with visible protrusions and aggregated clusters disrupting\
    \ the otherwise uniform glass matrix. These clusters, roughly 10-20 µm in diameter, create a mottled appearance, suggesting\
    \ a mix of dust, oils, or manufacturing residues.\n\nZooming into specific regions, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\
    \ (EDX) indicates elevated carbon and trace metal signatures, pointing to organic contaminants and possible metallic debris.\
    \ The contamination pattern isn’t uniform; it’s heavier near edges, perhaps due to handling or environmental exposure\
    \ during processing. This unevenness compromises reflectivity—down from the material’s typical 3.6%—and likely impacts\
    \ performance in applications like aerospace optics where precision is critical. Some areas show micro-pitting or etching\
    \ beneath the layer, hinting at early chemical degradation, though it’s hard to say without further testing.\n\nLooking\
    \ closer, the surface also exhibits micro-cracks, barely visible but measurable at approximately—or more precisely—1.2\
    \ µm in length, radiating from larger contaminant clusters. These could be stress points from thermal expansion mismatches\
    \ (fused silica’s coefficient is a low 0.55 x 10⁻⁶/°C). Honestly, it’s a mess under the scope, and that’s a problem for\
    \ functional integrity, especially in semiconductor manufacturing where even minor defects throw off results. The contamination,\
    \ while not catastrophic, clearly needs addressing to restore the surface to spec."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the fused silica surface at 500x magnification under SEM shows a dramatic transformation\
    \ compared to its contaminated state. The patchy, 2-5 µm thick film of deposits is virtually gone, with only isolated\
    \ residual specks—less than 0.3 µm in size—remaining in a few spots. Surface roughness has improved significantly, approaching\
    \ the original 0.5 nm Ra value, as confirmed by profilometry measurements. The mottled appearance from contaminant clusters\
    \ (previously 10-20 µm in diameter) has been replaced by a near-uniform, glassy texture, restoring the material’s characteristic\
    \ clarity and smoothness critical for applications like medical device optics.\n\nExamining further, EDX analysis reveals\
    \ a sharp drop in carbon and trace metal signals, confirming effective removal of organic and metallic residues. Reflectivity\
    \ appears visually enhanced—likely back near the baseline 3.6%—though exact measurements are pending. Those micro-cracks,\
    \ once around 1.2 µm long, are still faintly visible but seem unchanged by the cleaning process, suggesting they’re inherent\
    \ to prior stress rather than contamination-related (as noted in initial observations). Surface integrity looks solid,\
    \ with no new pitting or thermal damage evident, which is key since fused silica’s laser damage threshold is 15 J/cm²\
    \ for nanosecond pulses. The laser parameters were clearly dialed in to avoid ablation beyond the 2.5 J/cm² threshold.\
    \ All in all, the cleaning method worked well, bringing the surface back to a functional state for high-precision environments."
