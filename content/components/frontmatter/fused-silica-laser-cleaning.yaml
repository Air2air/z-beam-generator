caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fused silica surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 0.5–2 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and hydrocarbon films, creating a mottled, textured appearance. The contaminants disrupt the inherent surface smoothness, scattering light and forming irregular patterns that mask the substrate's native structure. This film significantly degrades optical transmission and introduces potential sites for laser-induced damage.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals its pristine, amorphous structure. The contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation, which occurred below the material''s damage threshold of 15 J/cm². The original surface roughness of approximately 0.5 nm Ra is now fully restored.


    The transformation is evident in the uniform, featureless topography observed at 500x magnification. The process successfully eliminated all particulate and film-based contaminants without inducing micro-fractures or subsurface damage. This restoration ensures optimal optical performance and mechanical integrity for high-precision applications.'
