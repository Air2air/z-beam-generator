        source: Corning Incorporated (Pyrex manufacturer) technical documentation
        research_basis: Pyrex borosilicate glass exhibits excellent chemical durability
          against water, acids, salt solutions, and halogens. It maintains stability
          in most environments except strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid, where
          it shows moderate corrosion. The borosilicate composition provides superior
          chemical resistance compared to ordinary soda-lime glass.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for Pyrex 7740
          borosilicate glass in air is consistently cited as 500°C by its primary
          manufacturer, Corning. This is not an oxidation temperature in the metallic
          sense, but the temperature at which the glass begins to undergo significant
          thermal deformation and chemical degradation, which is the relevant failure
          mode for this material class.

          Sheet"
        research_basis: The manufacturer's technical data sheet is the definitive
          source for this property. It lists the modulus of rupture (a measure of
          flexural strength) for annealed Pyrex 7740 glass as 69 MPa, determined by
          a standard 4-point bend test method (ASTM C158). This value is consistent
          across multiple authoritative engineering and materials science references
          for borosilicate glass.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of glass is significantly higher
          than its tensile strength. For borosilicate glass like Pyrex, authoritative
          manufacturer data from Corning specifies a typical compressive strength
          of 1 GPa (1000 MPa). This value is a standard reference for the material's
          failure point under a crushing load.
