caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated Pyrex surface is characterized by a non-uniform layer of particulate
    and film-based contamination. Particulates, ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers in diameter, are embedded in a thin, discontinuous
    organic film. This film, estimated to be 1-3 micrometers thick, creates a mottled, textured appearance that obscures the
    underlying glass.


    The surface topography is highly irregular, with agglomerated contaminants creating peaks and valleys that scatter light,
    reducing optical clarity. The native amorphous structure of the Pyrex is completely masked. The contamination layer exhibits
    poor adhesion in some areas, showing micro-cracking and delamination, which indicates a complex mixture of materials with
    differing thermal expansion coefficients compared to the glass substrate.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface is transformed. The contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing
    the pristine, amorphous Pyrex substrate. The surface roughness is now consistent with the native glass specification of
    approximately 0.5 nm Ra.


    At 500x magnification, the surface is featureless and smooth, with no residual particulates or film. This restoration
    of the original surface geometry results in high optical transmissivity, as light scattering sites have been eliminated.
    The laser process has successfully ablated the contaminants without inducing micro-fractures or thermal damage to the
    underlying glass structure.'
