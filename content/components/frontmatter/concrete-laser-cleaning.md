category: masonry
chemicalProperties:
  formula: CaO·SiO₂·H₂O (C-S-H gel primary phase)
  materialType: masonry
  symbol: N/A (Composite)
compatibility:
- Steel reinforcement (when properly shielded)
- Natural stone substrates (granite, limestone)
- Brick and masonry materials
complexity: low
composition:
- 'Portland cement (10–15%): Calcium silicates (C3S, C2S), calcium aluminates'
- 'Aggregate (60–75%): Silica (SiO₂), limestone, gravel'
- 'Water (15–20%): H₂O for hydration'
- 'Air voids (1–8%): Entrained or entrapped air'
description: Laser cleaning of concrete utilizes pulsed fiber lasers to selectively ablate surface contaminants through rapid thermal expansion and vaporization. The process exploits the differential absorption characteristics between contaminants and the calcium silicate hydrate matrix of concrete, enabling precise removal without mechanical damage or chemical residue.
difficultyScore: 2
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical waste generation
  description: Eliminates use of chemical solvents and abrasive media, preventing groundwater contamination and hazardous waste disposal (100% reduction in chemical waste streams)
- benefit: Reduced particulate matter emissions
  description: Generates 85–95% less airborne particulate matter compared to abrasive blasting methods, with effective filtration systems capturing >99% of generated particles
