description: Alabaster, chemically known as CaSO4·2H2O, is a soft, fine-grained mineral
  frequently used in sculpture and architectural elements. Its delicate nature requires
  careful handling during laser cleaning processes to avoid surface damage. Laser
  cleaning at a wavelength of 1064nm and fluence ranging from 0.5 to 5 J/cm² ensures
  effective removal of contaminants while preserving the integrity of the alabaster's
  surface. This method is particularly suitable for non-contact cleaning and ablation,
  which are crucial for the restoration of art pieces and preparation of construction
  materials.
