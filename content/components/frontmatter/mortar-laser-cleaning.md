description: Technical overview of Mortar, a masonry material, for laser cleaning.
  Mortar, composed primarily of cement, sand, and water, is commonly used in construction
  and heritage conservation. Laser cleaning of Mortar involves the use of a pulsed
  fiber laser at a wavelength of 1064nm, with fluence levels ranging from 1.0 to 10
  J/cm², to remove surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the material.
  This method is non-contact and highly effective for detailed restoration work on
  historic buildings and monuments.
