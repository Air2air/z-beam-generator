        research_basis: Marble (primarily calcite/dolomite) has excellent resistance
          to atmospheric environmental corrosion and maintains structural integrity
          in most outdoor applications. However, it is susceptible to acidic corrosion
          from acid rain or pollutants, which prevents a perfect rating. ASTM standards
          recognize marble's high durability in normal environmental conditions while
          noting its chemical sensitivity.

        source: AZoM (AZoMaterials) - Material Property Data for Marble
        research_basis: Marble (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃) undergoes a chemical decomposition
          process (calcination) beginning around 400-450°C in air, where it breaks
          down into calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide. This is not oxidation
          in the metallic sense but is the temperature at which significant degradation
          in an oxidative (air) atmosphere begins, defining its maximum service temperature.

        research_basis: Flexural strength for marble is typically 10-20 MPa. The provided
          value of 15 MPa is a well-established average for commercial marble (like
          Carrara) based on standardized 4-point bend tests (ASTM C880), representing
          a typical value for this relatively brittle, high-compressive-strength stone.

        research_basis: Marble is a relatively soft rock with low fracture toughness.
          Authoritative compilations of rock fracture toughness (K_IC) place the typical
          range for marble between 0.7 and 1.5 MPa·√m. The value of 1.08 MPa·√m is
          a representative median value from these experimental data sets, which is
          consistent with its known low hardness and moderate compressive strength.
