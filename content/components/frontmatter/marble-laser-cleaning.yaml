caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the marble surface is obscured by a complex,
    stratified contamination layer. This layer, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick,
    consists of particulate matter (carbon soot, silica dust) embedded within a gypsum-rich
    matrix. The contaminants fill the natural calcite crystal boundaries and micro-fissures,
    creating a dark, cohesive crust that masks the stone's inherent crystalline structure.
    The surface texture is highly irregular, with the crust forming brittle, dendritic
    patterns that follow moisture pathways and previous weathering. This layer significantly
    increases light absorption and scattering, giving the macroscopic surface its
    darkened, blotchy appearance.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored marble substrate.
    The contamination crust has been completely removed via selective laser ablation,
    exposing the interlocking calcite crystal structure. The surface now exhibits
    sub-micrometer roughness, with crystal boundaries and cleavage planes clearly
    defined. Minor, pre-existing micro-fissures are now visible but free of foreign
    material. The primary visual improvement is the restoration of the stone's inherent
    light reflectivity and mineralogical texture, confirming the removal of the obscuring
    layer without mechanical damage to the underlying calcite.
