caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the marble surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of particulate matter (soot, dust) embedded within a dark, carbonaceous matrix,
    likely from pollution. The underlying calcite crystals are partially visible,
    but their interlocking texture is muted. The contaminants have filled the natural
    micro-fissures and porosity of the stone, creating a continuous, dark crust that
    compromises the substrate's reflectivity and obscures its intrinsic crystalline
    structure.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation.
    The stratified contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine,
    interlocking structure of the calcite crystals. The marble's intrinsic micro-topography,
    including grain boundaries and subtle cleavage planes, is now clearly defined.
    The surface exhibits restored reflectivity and a clean, mineral-white appearance,
    with no thermal damage or residue observed. The process has successfully ablated
    the crust while preserving the substrate's integrity.
