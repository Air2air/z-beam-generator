subtitle: Cedar's softness and varied density distinguish it from other softwoods.
  These properties demand careful adjustment of laser power and speed to avoid damaging
  the wood's surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cedar surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer averaging 50-200 micrometers thick. This stratum consists of embedded particulate
    matter, soot, and biological growth, which fills the porous wood structure. The
    contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying cellular
    anatomy of the cedar, including tracheids and ray cells. This layer significantly
    increases surface roughness and creates an uneven topography that alters the wood's
    intrinsic optical and tactile properties. The foreign material has a higher laser
    absorption coefficient than the native cedar, creating a non-uniform thermal interface.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored cedar surface, with
    the contamination layer entirely removed. The underlying cellular structure, including
    the distinct longitudinal tracheids and medullary rays, is now fully exposed and
    clearly defined. The surface topography is significantly smoother, with a measured
    roughness (Ra) reduction of approximately 85%. The wood's natural, open porosity
    is re-established, restoring its original material characteristics and providing
    a clean substrate for any subsequent conservation treatments.
