        source: Wood Database (www.wood-database.com) - Cedar wood properties and
          durability ratings
        research_basis: Cedar wood demonstrates moderate natural decay resistance
          due to extractives and oils that provide some protection against fungi and
          insects. However, it has limited resistance to moisture, weathering, and
          ground contact compared to more durable woods like teak or ipe. Western
          Red Cedar, for example, typically receives a "moderate" durability rating
          with a service life of 15-25 years for above-ground applications, placing
          it in the lower-middle range of wood durability scales.

        research_basis: The source provides an ignition temperature range of 170-190°C
          for various wood species in long-term exposure. The lower end of this range
          (170°C) is the temperature at which significant thermal degradation and
          oxidation begin, but 177°C is a commonly cited maximum safe continuous service
          temperature for wood in engineering applications before charring and significant
          loss of mechanical properties occur.
