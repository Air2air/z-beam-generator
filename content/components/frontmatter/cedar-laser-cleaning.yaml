caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the cedar surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous contamination layer approximately
    50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of soot, dust, and biological growth, fills the wood's porous structure and masks
    the underlying cellular detail. The surface texture appears matte and uneven, with contaminants forming a continuous film
    that disrupts the natural grain pattern and occludes the characteristic tracheid and ray cell structures.
  after_text: 'Laser cleaning has effectively removed the opaque contamination layer, revealing the intact cellular anatomy
    of the cedar. The surface now exhibits a clear definition of longitudinal tracheids and ray parenchyma, with the wood''s
    natural porosity (approximately 65%) fully restored. The ablation process has selectively removed foreign material while
    preserving the delicate cell walls, which remain structurally sound.


    The cleaned surface displays a significantly refined texture, with the original grain pattern and subtle growth ring variations
    now distinctly visible. The reflectivity has increased from approximately 0.12 to a value more consistent with clean wood,
    as the removal of light-absorbing contaminants exposes the native lignin and cellulose. This precise, non-contact method
    has achieved a microscopically clean substrate without the mechanical abrasion or moisture ingress associated with conventional
    cleaning techniques, establishing an optimal surface for subsequent conservation treatments.'
