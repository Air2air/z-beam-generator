caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cedar surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres to the
    wood's cellular structure. This layer consists of embedded soot particles, organic
    debris, and degraded wood resins, which fill the porous tracheid cells. The underlying
    cedar's characteristic grain pattern is largely hidden. The contamination exhibits
    poor adhesion in areas, creating micro-fissures, while forming a dense, light-absorbing
    film elsewhere that masks the wood's natural color and texture.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the 500x view reveals a restored cedar surface. The contamination
    crust has been entirely removed, exposing the clean, open lumen of the tracheid
    cells. The wood's distinct growth ring structure and grain pattern are now fully
    visible, with minimal residual debris. The surface topography shows no evidence
    of mechanical abrasion or heat damage, preserving the delicate cellular walls.
    The natural, light-toned wood substrate is exposed, significantly increasing light
    reflectivity.
