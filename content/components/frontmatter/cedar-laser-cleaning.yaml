caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated cedar surface reveals a complex, multi-layered structure. A continuous
    biofilm, approximately 15-25 micrometers thick, obscures the underlying wood cells. This layer appears as an amorphous,
    gelatinous matrix with embedded particulate matter, including soot aggregates and mineral dust particles measuring 2-10
    micrometers in diameter.


    The wood''s natural cellular architecture is largely concealed. The tracheid cells and ray parenchyma are filled with
    the contaminant matrix, which creates a textured, uneven surface profile. The contamination penetrates the porous structure
    to a depth of up to 50 micrometers, utilizing the wood''s 65% porosity. This infiltration creates a discontinuous surface
    that masks the cedar''s intrinsic grain pattern and micro-textural features.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, restoring the cedar''s native anatomical structure. The contaminant
    layer has been completely removed, revealing the clean, open lumens of the tracheid cells and the organized pattern of
    the ray parenchyma. The surface now exhibits the precise cellular geometry characteristic of cedar wood.


    The process has effectively cleared the porous network without damaging the delicate cell walls. The resulting surface
    is topographically consistent with the wood''s natural grain, showing no evidence of charring or thermal degradation.
    The micro-texture is defined solely by the wood''s intrinsic cellular architecture, with a surface roughness corresponding
    directly to the anatomical features.'
