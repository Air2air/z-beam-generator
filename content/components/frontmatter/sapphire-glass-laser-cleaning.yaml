caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sapphire surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from sub-micron to 5 µm in diameter,
    is embedded in a thin, amorphous film. This film, approximately 100-500 nm thick,
    creates a topographical texture that scatters light, significantly reducing the
    intrinsic transmissivity of the substrate. The underlying sapphire's atomic-level
    smoothness of ~0.5 nm Ra is completely masked by this adherent layer of foreign
    material.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals its intrinsic 0.5 nm Ra polish, with
    the crystalline structure now clearly defined. All particulate and film-based
    contaminants have been removed, restoring optical clarity and the material's original
    surface energy. The laser process has selectively ablated the contaminants without
    inducing micro-fractures or altering the sapphire's surface morphology.
