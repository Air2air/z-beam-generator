caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sapphire surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 0.5–2 µm thick. This layer consists of fine particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film, likely hydrocarbon-based. The contaminants disrupt the substrate's inherent smoothness, creating a textured, irregular topography that scatters light and masks the true surface. Isolated micro-scratches from prior handling are also visible, filled with this foreign material.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the pristine sapphire substrate. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the original surface with a roughness of approximately 0.5 nm Ra. The surface is now continuous and uniform, with no residual film or particulates. Pre-existing micro-features like scratches are now clean and sharply defined, demonstrating the process's selectivity and the material's underlying integrity.
