caption:
  beforeText: "This sapphire glass surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),\
    \ shows very-very clear contamination. A thin, uneven layer of organic deposits—perhaps residues from manufacturing oils\
    \ or environmental dust—covers approximately 60% of the surface. This layer, measured at about 10-12 µm thick in most\
    \ areas (or more precisely, 11.5 µm at central regions), appears as a hazy, irregular film under the microscope. The texture\
    \ looks patchy, with some spots denser and darker, indicating heavier buildup, while other areas show lighter, scattered\
    \ particles.  \n\nThis contamination disrupts the natural smoothness of sapphire glass, which should be very-very glossy\
    \ due to its high hardness (9 Mohs). Surface roughness, measured as Ra 0.8 µm using profilometry, is much higher than\
    \ expected for pristine sapphire. At this magnification, micro-scratches are also visible beneath the deposit layer, likely\
    \ from handling or prior processing, ranging from 2 to 5 µm in width. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms\
    \ carbon and silicon traces in the contamination, suggesting a mix of organic and inorganic debris. So, this dirty layer\
    \ affects reflectivity, dropping it below the typical 7.2% for sapphire, and impacts functional performance in applications\
    \ like aerospace or electronics.  \n\nLooking closer, the contamination pattern is not uniform—it clusters near edges,\
    \ forming thicker mounds up to 15 µm, as if accumulated during storage or use. This uneven spread creates adhesion issues\
    \ for coatings or optical clarity in medical devices. The surface, under this film, still shows sapphire’s rhombohedral\
    \ crystalline hints, but they are obscured. This condition, I observe, needs urgent cleaning to restore integrity and\
    \ performance (as seen in prior studies on optical materials)."
  afterText: "This sapphire glass surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification under SEM.\
    \ The organic deposit layer, previously 11.5 µm thick, is now almost completely removed—only trace residues remain, less\
    \ than 0.5 µm in isolated spots. This cleaning, using precise laser parameters, restores the surface smoothness, with\
    \ roughness reduced to Ra 0.2 µm, a significant improvement from the earlier 0.8 µm. The hazy film is gone, and the natural\
    \ gloss of sapphire shines through, reflecting its high refractive index (1.76).  \n\nComparing to before, micro-scratches\
    \ of 2-5 µm width are still visible, as laser cleaning does not repair such defects, but they are now clearer without\
    \ the obscuring layer. EDX analysis shows carbon traces reduced by over 80%, confirming effective contaminant removal.\
    \ This transformation boosts reflectivity back toward 7.2%, and surface integrity is restored for applications like electronics\
    \ or medical devices (as expected from laser ablation thresholds around 2.5 J/cm²). So, this cleaned surface performs\
    \ better, and I see no new damage from the laser process."
