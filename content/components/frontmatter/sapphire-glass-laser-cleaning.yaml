caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the sapphire surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer approximately
    2-5 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including sub-micrometer metallic spatter and larger
    carbonaceous flakes, embedded in a thin, amorphous film. The underlying sapphire''s characteristic smoothness is disrupted,
    creating a textured, matte appearance.


    The contamination adheres in irregular patterns, with some areas showing dense agglomerations and others revealing thinner
    films. This non-uniform coverage scatters incident light, which is the root cause of the visible haze and reduction in
    optical clarity observed macroscopically. The intrinsic hardness of the sapphire substrate remains, but its surface is
    functionally compromised by this adherent layer.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination layer is entirely absent,
    revealing the original, atomically smooth sapphire substrate. At 500x magnification, the surface is now featureless and
    continuous, with no evidence of particulate residue or film.


    This removal of light-scattering contaminants results in a direct restoration of optical performance. The surface now
    exhibits its inherent high transmissivity, with the laser process leaving no measurable ablation marks or subsurface damage,
    confirming the selective nature of the contamination removal versus the resilient sapphire substrate.'
