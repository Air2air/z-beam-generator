caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the birch surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick. This stratum consists of deeply embedded particulate matter, soot, and organic residues that fill the porous wood structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying cellular anatomy. The native texture of the birch, including its vessel elements and medullary rays, is largely undiscernible beneath this occluding layer, which exhibits a rough, amorphous topography with significant surface shadowing.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the birch's anatomical features. The porous, cellular structure is now fully exposed, with individual tracheids and vessel elements clearly defined. The surface exhibits minimal thermal alteration, characterized only by a lightening of the lignin-rich cell walls. The previously obscured grain pattern and natural micro-texture are now visible, with a measured surface roughness reduction of over 85% compared to the contaminated state.
