        research_basis: Birch is a non-durable hardwood with low natural resistance
          to decay fungi and insects. According to USDA wood durability classifications,
          birch falls into the "non-resistant" to "slightly resistant" category for
          decay resistance, with service life of less than 5 years in ground contact.
          While it has moderate resistance to chemical corrosion compared to metals,
          its organic composition makes it susceptible to biological degradation,
          moisture damage, and environmental weathering.

          of Wood, USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. General Technical
          Report FPL-GTR-282.'
        research_basis: The Wood Handbook states that prolonged exposure to temperatures
          above 200°C (392°F) leads to significant thermal degradation of wood, including
          the onset of pyrolysis and oxidative reactions that permanently reduce strength.
          While ignition temperature is higher (~250°C), 200°C is the established
          maximum for sustained service before significant chemical decomposition
          begins.

          properties
        research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
          reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Yellow Birch as 13,900 psi, which
          converts to approximately 97 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength
          measured via standard 3-point or 4-point bend tests. While birch species
          vary, this falls within the typical 70-120 MPa range cited in wood mechanics
          literature for quality birch lumber.

        research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
          data for North American hardwoods. For yellow birch, it lists compressive
          strength (crushing strength) parallel to grain as 46.0 MPa at 12% moisture
          content, which is the standard test condition for wood mechanical properties
          according to ASTM D143. This value is consistent with published data from
          the USDA Forest Products Laboratory for birch species.
