caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the birch surface is obscured by a heterogeneous
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, dried residues, and microbial biofilms that fill the wood's
    porous structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous crust, masking the underlying
    grain texture and cell structure. This layer significantly alters the surface's
    optical properties, increasing light absorption and reducing the natural reflectivity
    of the wood.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the original birch surface. At 500x magnification, the wood's cellular anatomy—including
    vessels and fibers—is now fully exposed and clearly defined. The process removes
    the obscuring crust without damaging the underlying lignin or cellulose matrix,
    resulting in a clean, micro-rough surface that reveals the natural, open porosity
    of the wood.
