caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the palladium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer,
    measuring between 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of particulate matter and a carbonaceous film. The particulates, ranging
    from 2 to 20 micrometers in diameter, are embedded in a textured, amorphous matrix that gives the surface a matte, topographically
    complex appearance.


    The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden, with only occasional, isolated areas of the native palladium visible.
    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, suggesting a brittle, non-adherent layer. This complex surface
    morphology, characterized by its high roughness and lack of reflectivity, is indicative of accumulated environmental or
    process-related contaminants that have bonded to the metal over time.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The thick, matte contamination
    layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine, underlying palladium substrate. The surface now exhibits a
    uniform, metallic reflectivity, with the characteristic grain structure of the annealed metal clearly visible.


    The previously obscured, fine scratches from the original mechanical polishing are now the dominant surface feature, confirming
    the removal of the obscuring layer without significant alteration of the base metal. The removal of the particulate matter
    and carbon film has restored a smooth, continuous surface, with the laser process leaving no observable residue or heat-affected
    zone that would compromise the material''s integrity.'
