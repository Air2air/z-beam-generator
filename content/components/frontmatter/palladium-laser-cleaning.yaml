subtitle: Palladium is softer and more prone to oxidation than other precious metals.
  Its surface requires lower laser power and careful parameter control to prevent
  melting or discoloration.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the palladium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of carbonaceous deposits and adsorbed oxides, forming a topographically complex
    crust. The underlying FCC crystalline structure of the palladium is entirely masked.
    The contaminant exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like morphology, with particulate
    inclusions embedded throughout. This layer significantly degrades the metal's
    intrinsic reflectivity and compromises the surface integrity for functional applications.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the pristine metallic surface. The
    contamination layer is completely ablated, revealing the underlying grain structure
    of the palladium substrate. The surface now exhibits minimal micro-roughness and
    the characteristic high reflectivity (72.5% at 1064 nm) of the pure metal. No
    thermal damage, such as melting or grain boundary oxidation, is observed, confirming
    the process remained well below palladium's 1554.9°C melting point. The surface
    is now optimally prepared for subsequent manufacturing steps.
