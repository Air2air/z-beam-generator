caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the palladium surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 2-5 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    deposits and adsorbed oxides, creates a matte, topographically complex texture.
    The underlying FCC crystalline structure of the metal is entirely masked, with
    contamination filling the native grain boundaries and creating a non-uniform,
    speckled pattern that scatters light.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic metallic surface, revealing
    the distinct, polygonal grain structure of the FCC crystalline lattice. The contamination
    layer is completely absent, resulting in a specular, reflective finish. The grain
    boundaries are now sharply defined, and the surface exhibits minimal topographical
    variation, with a measured roughness (Ra) reduced to below 0.1 µm.
