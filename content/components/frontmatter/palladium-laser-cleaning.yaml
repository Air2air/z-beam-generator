caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the palladium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists
    of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and localized oxide nodules, which form irregular,
    blotchy patterns across the substrate. The underlying metal's FCC grain structure
    is entirely concealed. The contaminant morphology is porous and exhibits micro-fissures,
    creating a topographically complex and textured surface that scatters light, significantly
    reducing the material's inherent 65% reflectivity at 1064 nm. This layer adversely
    affects electrical contact and catalytic performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the pristine metallic surface. The
    contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the distinct, clean boundaries
    of the palladium's FCC grain structure. The surface is now smooth and highly reflective,
    with no residual oxide or carbonaceous deposits, restoring optimal material properties.
