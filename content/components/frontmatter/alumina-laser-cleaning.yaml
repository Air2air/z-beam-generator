        research_basis: Alumina (Al2O3) is an exceptionally stable oxide ceramic with
          outstanding chemical inertness. It is highly resistant to attack by a vast
          range of chemicals, including strong acids and alkalis at elevated temperatures,
          and is unaffected by oxidation. Its primary vulnerability is to hydrofluoric
          acid and strong caustics at very high temperatures, but for general environmental
          exposure (atmosphere, moisture), its corrosion resistance is considered
          excellent.

          "Alumina (Al2O3) ceramics are among the most stable oxides, with a melting
          point of ~2050°C. They exhibit excellent oxidation resistance and can be
          used continuously in air at temperatures up to 1900°C."'
        research_basis: Alumina (Al2O3) is a fully oxidized, stable oxide ceramic.
          It does not undergo further oxidation, so its "oxidation resistance temperature"
          is effectively its maximum use temperature in air, which is limited by creep
          and sintering rather than oxidation. Authoritative handbooks (ASM, Engineered
          Materials Handbook) consistently place this maximum continuous service temperature
          between 1700°C and 1950°C, with 1900°C being a commonly cited upper limit
          for high-purity, dense alumina before significant deformation occurs.
