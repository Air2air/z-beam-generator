caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, ranging
    from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness, consists of carbonaceous deposits, embedded particulate, and potential metallic
    oxides. The contaminants form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern that masks the underlying ceramic's intrinsic grain structure
    and micro-crystalline texture. The surface appears topographically rough, with the foreign material accumulating preferentially
    within the natural micro-porosity of the sintered alumina, creating a matte, light-absorbing finish.
  after_text: Post-laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored alpha-alumina microstructure. The contamination layer
    has been completely removed via ablation, exposing the homogeneous, fine-grained polycrystalline structure. The surface
    now exhibits the characteristic interlocking hexagonal crystals of the corundum phase, with a return to its inherent micro-hardness
    of 9 Mohs. The cleaning process restores the substrate's original reflectivity and chemical stability, leaving a pristine,
    contamination-free ceramic surface.
