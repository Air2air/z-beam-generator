    description: Compressive strength is the maximum compressive stress a material can withstand before fracture. For polycrystalline
      alumina, this property is exceptionally high due to its strong ionic/covalent bonding, fine grain size, and low porosity.
      It is significantly higher than its tensile strength, as ceramics typically fail from pre-existing flaws in tension
      but can support much higher loads in compression where flaws are less critical.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a thin, amorphous film, likely composed of organic
    residues and inorganic dust. The particulates, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers in diameter, are randomly distributed
    and disrupt the underlying ceramic''s topography.


    The inherent micro-texture of the sintered alumina is partially masked. The fine, interlocking grain structure of the
    ceramic substrate is visible only in isolated areas where contamination is thinner. The contamination film creates a mottled,
    high-contrast appearance under the microscope, with visible staining and shadowing that highlights surface defects and
    porosity. This layer significantly alters the surface''s reflectivity and masks its true morphology.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The particulate and film-based
    contamination have been entirely removed, exposing the pristine alumina substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic,
    fine-grained polycrystalline structure of sintered alumina, with individual grains and grain boundaries clearly defined.


    The laser process has effectively ablated the contamination layer without inducing micro-cracking or significant surface
    melting on the underlying ceramic. A direct comparison shows the restoration of the material''s original texture and reflectivity.
    The surface is uniform, with no evidence of the residual staining or shadowing previously observed, confirming the selective
    and non-abrasive nature of the laser cleaning process.'
