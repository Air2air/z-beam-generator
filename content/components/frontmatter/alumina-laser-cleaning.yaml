    description: Compressive strength is the maximum compressive stress a material can withstand before fracture. For polycrystalline alumina, this property is exceptionally high due to its strong ionic/covalent bonding, fine grain size, and low porosity. It is significantly higher than its tensile strength, as ceramics typically fail from pre-existing flaws in tension but can support much higher loads in compression where flaws are less critical.
