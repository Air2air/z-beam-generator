caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits, particulate inclusions (1-10 µm), and adsorbed organic
    films. The underlying alumina's fine-grained, hexagonal crystalline structure is entirely masked. The contaminant morphology
    is irregular, creating a textured, high-relief topography that scatters light and appears dark and mottled. This layer
    disrupts the substrate's intrinsic thermal and electrical surface properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, polycrystalline alumina substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, fine-grained
    microstructure with clearly defined grain boundaries. All contamination has been removed, restoring the material's inherent
    light-gray appearance and smooth topography. The surface is now optically homogeneous and suitable for high-integrity
    applications.
