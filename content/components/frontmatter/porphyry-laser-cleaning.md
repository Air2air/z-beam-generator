description: Porphyry is an igneous rock known for its durability and aesthetic appeal,
  making it a preferred choice for historical structures and artistic sculptures.
  Laser cleaning of porphyry involves the use of a pulsed fiber laser operating at
  a wavelength of 1064nm, with a fluence range of 1.0–10 J/cm² and pulse durations
  ranging from 10-50ns. This method allows for the precise removal of surface contaminants
  without damaging the underlying material, preserving its intricate microstructure
  and color. The non-contact nature of laser cleaning ensures minimal physical stress
  on the porphyry, making it ideal for restoration and maintenance applications.
