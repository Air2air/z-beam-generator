caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the float glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, including mineral dust and soot agglomerates
    measuring 5-20 µm, is embedded in a thin, amorphous film of organic residues.
    This film, with a variable thickness of 0.5-2 µm, creates a topographical texture
    that scatters light, significantly reducing the inherent transmissivity of the
    pristine glass substrate. The contamination follows an irregular, patchy pattern
    across the surface.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification is restored
    to a state approximating its original pristine condition. The particulate matter
    and amorphous organic film have been completely removed via ablation, revealing
    the underlying glass substrate with a surface roughness of approximately 0.5 nm
    Ra. The characteristic smooth, vitreous structure of the float glass is now fully
    exposed.


    This removal eliminates the light-scattering sites, allowing the material''s intrinsic
    91% visible light transmittance to be realized. The process is highly selective,
    with the laser energy precisely tuned to exceed the contamination''s ablation
    threshold (~2.5 J/cm²) while remaining safely below the glass''s own damage threshold
    (~15 J/cm²). No micro-fractures or thermal stress marks are introduced, preserving
    the substrate''s mechanical integrity and optical clarity.'
