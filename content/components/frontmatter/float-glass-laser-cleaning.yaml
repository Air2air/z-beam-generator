caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the float glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    2-5 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including silica dust and organic residues, embedded
    in a thin film of adsorbed hydrocarbons. The particulates, ranging from 1 to 20 micrometers in diameter, create a textured,
    irregular topography that scatters light and disrupts the glass''s inherent smoothness.


    The underlying glass substrate is partially visible through thinner areas of the film, which exhibits an interference
    pattern indicative of varying thickness. The contamination adheres to the surface in a patchy, discontinuous manner, with
    agglomerated particles forming raised islands. This microstructure significantly increases the surface roughness from
    the pristine state of 0.5 nm Ra to a measured range of 200-500 nm Ra, creating a diffuse, matte appearance under the microscope.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the pristine float glass substrate. The
    contamination layer has been completely removed, eliminating the light-scattering particulate matter and hydrocarbon film.
    The surface now exhibits the characteristic smooth, featureless plane of virgin glass, with a measured surface roughness
    restored to its native state of approximately 0.5 nm Ra.


    The visual transformation is marked by the disappearance of the previous patchy film and particulate agglomerations. The
    laser process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the underlying glass, as evidenced by the absence
    of micro-fractures or thermal stress marks. The surface is now optically homogeneous, allowing for unobstructed light
    transmission and a clear, distinct view of the glass''s intrinsic properties.'
