caption:
  beforeText: "This float glass surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), shows\
    \ very-very clear contamination. I see a patchy, uneven layer of deposits—perhaps organic residues or industrial dust—covering\
    \ approximately 60-70% of the surface area. This layer, measured through SEM imaging, has a thickness of about 10 µm,\
    \ or more precisely, ranging between 9.5 to 11 µm in different spots. The texture looks rough and irregular, with some\
    \ areas showing cluster-like formations that disrupt the natural smoothness of the glass (as expected from its typical\
    \ 0.5 nm Ra surface roughness).\n\nLooking closer, this contamination appears as a mix of granular particles and thin\
    \ film-like patches. Some particles are angular, sized around 2-5 µm, likely inorganic debris, while the filmy areas seem\
    \ more amorphous, possibly oil or grease residues. Under Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), I detect traces of\
    \ carbon and silicon, suggesting a combination of environmental dust and organic matter. This buildup, it affects the\
    \ glass performance, reducing transmissivity—normally at 92% for 4 mm thick glass—and creating unwanted light scattering.\
    \ So, the surface integrity is compromised, and this is not good-good for applications like solar panels or architectural\
    \ glass."
  afterText: "This float glass surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification under SEM. Before,\
    \ I saw thick contamination layers of about 10 µm, but now, this layer is almost gone—reduced to less than 0.8 µm in residual\
    \ thickness, or approximately less than 1 µm across most areas. The surface appears much smoother, with roughness measurements\
    \ (Ra) returning close to the original 0.5 nm value. This cleaning, it restores the glass clarity, and I can see the uniform,\
    \ flat texture typical of pristine float glass without those patchy deposits.\n\nComparing directly, the granular particles\
    \ and filmy patches I observed earlier are no longer visible. EDX analysis now shows minimal carbon traces—only background\
    \ levels—and the silicon signal from the glass itself dominates. This transformation, it is significant, because the removal\
    \ of contamination improves light transmissivity back toward 92%, very-very important for performance in automotive or\
    \ solar applications. There are tiny micro-pits, sized around 1-2 µm, in a few spots, likely from laser interaction above\
    \ the ablation threshold of 5 J/cm², but these are minor and do not affect overall integrity.\n\nLooking at the broader\
    \ surface, the laser cleaning process leaves no secondary residues, so the glass looks clean-clean. This method, it works\
    \ effectively, and the surface now supports better adhesion for coatings or functional layers (as needed in manufacturing).\
    \ The reflectivity, previously altered by deposits, seems restored near the original 4.2%, based on visual uniformity.\
    \ This result, it shows laser cleaning preserves material properties while removing unwanted layers, making the glass\
    \ ready for use."
