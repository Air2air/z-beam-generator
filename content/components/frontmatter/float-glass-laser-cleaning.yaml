caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the float glass surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    layer of particulate and hydrocarbon contamination. This layer, ranging from 100
    nm to 5 µm in thickness, consists of imbedded silica and alumina particles, carbonaceous
    soot, and organic residues. The contaminants create a topographical landscape
    of peaks and valleys, disrupting the pristine surface roughness of approximately
    0.5 nm Ra. This layer significantly scatters incident light, reducing optical
    clarity and increasing light diffusion across the surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the surface to its intrinsic state, revealing
    the original, atomically smooth substrate with a characteristic roughness near
    0.5 nm Ra. At 500x magnification, all exogenous particulate and hydrocarbon films
    have been completely removed, eliminating the previous light-scattering topography.
    The surface is now a continuous, homogeneous plane with no evidence of laser-induced
    micro-fractures or thermal stress marks. This pristine condition ensures minimal
    light diffusion, allowing the glass to achieve its inherent transmissivity of
    approximately 91% for visible light.
