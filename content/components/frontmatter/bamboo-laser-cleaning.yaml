        research_basis: Bamboo, while having good resistance to some environmental
          factors due to its silica content and natural waxes, has poor durability
          against fungal decay, insects, and moisture when untreated. It rates low
          on wood durability scales (Class 5 - not durable) with untreated bamboo
          typically lasting 1-3 years in ground contact. Proper treatment can improve
          resistance, but base material has limited corrosion resistance comparable
          to other non-durable woods.

          Wood-Base Fiber and Particle Panel Materials"
        research_basis: Bamboo, as a lignocellulosic material, follows wood pyrolysis
          principles where significant thermal degradation begins around 200°C. The
          cited ASTM standard for wood-based materials establishes that prolonged
          exposure above 200°C in air leads to oxidative degradation, charring, and
          measurable strength reduction. This temperature represents the threshold
          where chemical decomposition of lignin and hemicellulose components becomes
          significant under oxidative conditions.

        research_basis: This peer-reviewed study directly tested Bambusa vulgaris
          in a 3-point bend test, reporting a mean modulus of rupture (MOR), which
          is the flexural strength, of 140 MPa. This value is consistent with the
          established range for bamboo (typically 100-200 MPa) and aligns with its
          known high hardness (1580 MPa) and low density (0.6 g/cm³), indicating a
          strong, lightweight material. The confidence is slightly tempered by natural
          variability between bamboo species and test conditions.

          Research and Technology (2014).'
        research_basis: Bamboo's compressive strength is highly anisotropic and varies
          significantly with species, moisture content, and position along the culm
          (node vs. internode). The provided range of 40-80 MPa is well-established
          in composite and materials science literature for the longitudinal compressive
          strength of dry bamboo culm material, representing a consolidation of data
          from multiple standardized mechanical tests. The wide range accounts for
          natural variability.
