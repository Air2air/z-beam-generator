caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of accumulated soot, grime, and degraded organic matter, fills the natural micro-pores and fissures of the bamboo structure. The underlying fiber bundles and vascular channels are completely masked, presenting a uniformly occluded and texturally flat topography with no visible cellular detail.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the intricate, native microstructure of the bamboo. The surface now exhibits clearly defined longitudinal fiber bundles with a distinct, aligned grain pattern. Individual vascular channels and parenchyma cells are fully exposed, restoring the material's characteristic micro-roughness of approximately 8.5 µm Ra. The cleaning process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the primary cellulose cell walls, as evidenced by the sharp, well-preserved edges of the fiber structures. This results in a surface with restored morphological integrity and no evidence of charring or thermal degradation.
