caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated bamboo surface is dominated by a non-uniform layer of marine corrosion
    deposits, measuring 15-40 micrometers thick. This layer consists of crystalline salt clusters and amorphous biological
    films that obscure the underlying fiber structure. The deposits penetrate the porous surface, filling natural micro-pores
    and fissures characteristic of bamboo''s 40% porosity.


    The contamination creates a discontinuous topography with significant surface roughness, increasing the measured Ra value
    from the natural 3.2 µm to approximately 8.5 µm. The crystalline structures show dendritic growth patterns, while the
    biological films form webbed networks across the fiber matrix. This composite layer completely masks the characteristic
    longitudinal fiber alignment and vascular bundle patterns of the bamboo substrate.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing the intact bamboo microstructure previously obscured
    by contamination. The surface now displays clearly defined longitudinal fibers and vascular bundles, with the characteristic
    porous architecture fully restored. The cleaning process has selectively removed the 15-40 µm contamination layer without
    damaging the underlying cellulose structure.


    The restored surface shows significantly reduced roughness, returning to near-original values of approximately 3.5 µm
    Ra. The laser parameters were calibrated using the material''s absorption characteristics (32.7 cm⁻¹ at 1064 nm) to ensure
    complete contaminant removal while staying below bamboo''s thermal destruction threshold of 204°C. This precision cleaning
    is evident in the preserved cell wall integrity and continuous fiber alignment.


    Comparative analysis confirms the removal mechanism operated through controlled thermal ablation of surface contaminants,
    leaving the fundamental bamboo microstructure intact. The process has re-established the material''s natural surface geometry
    while maintaining the mechanical properties of the fiber-reinforced composite structure, providing an optimal substrate
    for subsequent marine coatings or treatments.'
