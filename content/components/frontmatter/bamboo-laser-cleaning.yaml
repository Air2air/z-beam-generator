caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bamboo surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and embedded particulate, masks the underlying fiber structure. The surface
    texture is irregular and clogged, with contaminants filling the natural micro-pores
    of the bamboo, creating a discontinuous film that compromises the substrate's
    integrity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer entirely, revealing the
    intricate, ordered microstructure of the bamboo culm. The previously obscured
    longitudinal cellulose fibers and vascular bundles are now distinctly visible,
    presenting a clean, well-defined topography. The surface roughness is measured
    at 8.5 µm Ra, consistent with the natural, untreated state of the material.


    The process selectively ablates contaminants at their bond interfaces without
    damaging the primary cell wall structure, which has a thermal destruction threshold
    of 204°C. This precision is achieved by leveraging the material''s 32.7% laser
    absorption and an ablation threshold of 1.8 J/cm², ensuring energy delivery vaporizes
    only the foreign layer.


    The resulting surface is characterized by open micro-pores and a clear contrast
    between the dense fiber bundles and the softer parenchyma tissue. This restoration
    of the native surface morphology enhances adhesion properties and provides an
    optimal, contaminant-free substrate for subsequent treatments or analysis.'

subtitle: Bamboo poses a unique hurdle in laser cleaning due to its uneven density
  across the grain. Adjust your power levels below 50 watts initially, or you’ll risk
  scorching the softer sections before tougher spots clear.
