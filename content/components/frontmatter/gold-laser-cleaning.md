description: Gold (Au), denoted by the symbol GO, is prized for its high thermal and
  electrical conductivity, making it ideal for laser cleaning applications in electronics
  and jewelry. Laser cleaning of gold involves the use of a 1064nm wavelength laser
  with a fluence range of 0.5–5 J/cm² and pulse durations between 10-100ns. This process
  efficiently removes surface contaminants and oxide layers without damaging the underlying
  gold structure, preserving its intrinsic properties and aesthetic value.
