caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polypropylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and embedded particulate, disrupts the polymer's inherent semi-crystalline
    texture. The contaminants form a discontinuous film, with agglomerations preferentially
    adhering to surface micro-asperities. The underlying polypropylene morphology
    is largely hidden, with only the tallest spherulitic structures visible as faint
    topographical relief beneath the occluding layer. This coverage significantly
    alters surface energy and adhesion properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native polypropylene morphology. The
    contaminant layer is entirely removed, revealing a well-defined spherulitic microstructure
    characteristic of the polymer's ~60% crystallinity. The surface exhibits minimal
    heat-affected zone, with sharp, distinct boundaries between crystalline and amorphous
    regions. The original micro-texture is fully exposed, resulting in a surface defined
    by its intrinsic material properties rather than foreign deposits.
