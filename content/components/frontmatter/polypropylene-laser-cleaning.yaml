subtitle: Polypropylene has a lower melting point and is more sensitive to heat than
  many other plastics. This requires the use of significantly lower laser power to
  avoid melting the surface during cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polypropylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter and a greasy film, which fills the characteristic micro-texture
    of the molded plastic. The contaminants disrupt the native surface morphology,
    creating a topographically chaotic landscape that masks the polymer's inherent
    semi-crystalline structure. This layer significantly increases light scattering
    and reduces the material's functional surface energy.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native polypropylene topography. The
    contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the original molded surface
    with its micro-scale flow lines and spherulitic crystalline structures. The surface
    now exhibits a uniform, clean appearance with no residual char or thermal degradation,
    confirming the process operated below the polymer's ablation threshold. This results
    in optimal surface energy for subsequent bonding or coating operations.
