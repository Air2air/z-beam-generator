        research_basis: Polypropylene is widely recognized for its excellent resistance
          to a wide range of acids, alkalis, and solvents, making it highly suitable
          for chemical containers and piping. It is susceptible to degradation by
          strong oxidizing agents and some organic solvents, which prevents a perfect
          score, but its overall chemical resistance in common environments is considered
          very high.

        source: UL 746B "Standard for Safety Polymeric Materials - Long Term Property
          Evaluations"
        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for polypropylene
          in an air (oxidizing) environment is typically cited as 100°C by standards
          organizations like UL and in engineering handbooks. This is the temperature
          at which long-term thermal aging and oxidation become significant concerns,
          limiting its mechanical properties over extended periods. While polypropylene
          can withstand short-term exposures to higher temperatures, 100°C represents
          the conservative upper limit for continuous use where oxidative degradation
          is controlled.

        research_basis: According to the authoritative materials database AZoM, the
          flexural modulus for Polypropylene is typically in the range of 1.5-2.0
          GPa, and the flexural strength is reported as 25-45 MPa. The value of 35
          MPa represents a standard mid-range value for general-purpose polypropylene,
          consistent with data from 3-point bend tests commonly used for polymer characterization.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of polypropylene is consistently
          reported in the range of 30-40 MPa by materials databases and polymer handbooks.
          The provided value of 35 MPa is a typical median for general-purpose grades.
          It is important to note that this property is highly dependent on the specific
          grade (e.g., homopolymer vs. copolymer), fillers, strain rate, and test
          temperature, which are often not specified in generalized data sheets.
