caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polypropylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and particulate matter, disrupts the substrate's inherent micro-texture
    of 0.8 µm Ra. The contaminants form an irregular, matte film that masks the polymer's
    semi-crystalline structure, significantly increasing light scattering and reducing
    surface energy.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine polypropylene substrate, restoring
    its intrinsic micro-topography. The previously obscured 0.8 µm Ra surface texture
    is now fully visible, with the semi-crystalline morphology appearing intact. The
    process has selectively removed the contamination layer without inducing macroscopic
    melting, resulting in a surface with minimal subsurface damage and restored chemical
    functionality.
