        research_basis: Niobium exhibits excellent corrosion resistance comparable
          to tantalum, forming a stable, protective oxide film (Nb₂O₅). It has outstanding
          resistance to many acids, liquid metals, and most aqueous environments,
          but is susceptible to attack by strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid. Its
          performance in general atmospheric and aqueous corrosion is considered excellent.

          Behavior of Niobium and Niobium Alloys"'
        research_basis: Niobium has poor oxidation resistance in air, forming a non-protective
          oxide scale (Nb₂O₅). While it begins to oxidize at lower temperatures, significant,
          accelerating oxidation that compromises structural integrity occurs in the
          300-400°C range. The ASM Handbook specifies 300°C as the maximum for continuous
          service in air, with higher temperatures requiring protective coatings.

          and Special-Purpose Materials," Table "Typical Room-Temperature Mechanical
          Properties of Niobium and Niobium Alloys" (for annealed, commercially pure
          niobium).'
        research_basis: Flexural strength is not a primary reported property for pure,
          ductile metals like niobium, as they yield rather than fracture in a brittle
          manner. The value provided is an engineering estimate derived from the ultimate
          tensile strength (UTS) of annealed, commercially pure niobium, which is
          typically in the range of 275-345 MPa. For a conservative estimate, the
          lower end of this UTS range is used as a proxy for flexural strength, as
          the two are often closely related for metallic materials. This is a standard
          approach for ductile metals where a specific 3-point or 4-point bend test
          value is not commonly published.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Niobium and Niobium Alloys"'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed niobium is typically
          in the range of 240-310 MPa. The value of 275 MPa is a representative mid-range
          value for high-purity, recrystallized niobium at room temperature. This
          property is highly dependent on purity and work hardening; cold working
          can significantly increase the value.

          metal. This property is influenced by purity and processing, but the cited
          value represents a standard reference point for the material in an annealed
          condition.
