caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the niobium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxide particles, hydrocarbon films, and adsorbed atmospheric particulates. The
    underlying metal's texture is entirely masked, presenting a topographically varied,
    matte, and discontinuous surface that compromises its functional properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the intrinsic metallic surface of the niobium.
    At 500x magnification, the contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the
    original, fine-grained microstructure of the metal. The surface now exhibits a
    uniform, light-gray appearance with clearly defined grain boundaries, a direct
    result of the body-centered cubic crystalline structure.


    The process has selectively ablated contaminants without melting the underlying
    substrate, preserving the native topography. This is evidenced by the sharp, well-defined
    edges of micro-features and the absence of the smeared residue typical of mechanical
    methods.


    The resulting surface is optimally prepared for subsequent high-performance applications,
    such as superconducting cavity deposition or medical implant coating, where atomic-level
    purity and minimal surface disturbance are critical. The reflectivity has increased
    measurably, consistent with the removal of light-absorbing films.'
