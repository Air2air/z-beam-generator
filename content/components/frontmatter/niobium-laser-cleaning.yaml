caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the niobium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of embedded particulate and a discontinuous oxide scale. The underlying
    metal's topography is masked by this adherent film, which exhibits a cracked,
    mudflat-like pattern. Fine, sub-micron particles are agglomerated within the valleys
    of the native surface grain structure, creating a textured, matte appearance that
    significantly increases light scattering and diffuses the metallic luster of the
    pure substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the intrinsic niobium surface, revealing a distinct
    grain boundary network at 500x magnification. The contamination layer is entirely
    absent, exposing the pure metal's micro-texture with sub-micron precision. The
    surface now exhibits a consistent, low-roughness profile characteristic of the
    base material. This results in a specular, reflective finish with a clear metallic
    gleam, contrasting sharply with the previous light-scattering, matte appearance.
