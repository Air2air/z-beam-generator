caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the niobium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a discontinuous oxide scale, appearing as dark,
    mottled patches against the lighter metal substrate. The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination filling
    the natural grain boundaries of the underlying niobium.


    The contamination layer exhibits poor adhesion characteristics, visible as micro-cracking and delamination at the interface
    with the base metal. Particulate contaminants, ranging from 2-20 micrometers in diameter, are randomly distributed across
    the surface and partially embedded in the oxide layer. This heterogeneous coverage creates a topographically complex surface
    that masks the true metallic character of the niobium beneath.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification reveals the true metallic substrate.
    The previously obscured grain structure of the niobium is now clearly visible, with well-defined boundaries emerging across
    the entire surface. The contamination layer has been completely removed through controlled laser ablation, leaving no
    residual oxide patches or embedded particulates.


    The cleaning process has exposed the native surface texture without altering the underlying metal microstructure. The
    reflectivity has increased significantly due to the removal of light-absorbing contaminants, creating a more uniform surface
    appearance. Minor surface features such as polishing marks from original manufacturing are now visible, confirming the
    selective nature of the contamination removal.


    Analysis confirms the laser parameters were calibrated below niobium''s ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm², ensuring only
    contaminants were removed while preserving the base metal integrity. The cleaned surface demonstrates the process effectiveness
    through complete contaminant elimination and exposure of the original niobium topography without thermal damage to the
    critical crystalline structure.'
