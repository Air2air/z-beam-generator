caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the niobium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous particulates and a discontinuous oxide scale, primarily niobium pentoxide
    (Nb₂O₅). The underlying metal's grain structure is entirely hidden. The topography
    is chaotic, with patches of amorphous deposits and localized pitting, which scatter
    incident light and create a matte, dark appearance. This contamination directly
    interferes with the metal's intrinsic properties, such as its electrical conductivity
    and superconducting potential.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic niobium surface. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct, clean grain boundaries of
    the underlying BCC crystalline structure. The surface is now uniform and smooth,
    with a metallic luster indicative of the pure, oxide-free metal, ready for high-performance
    applications.
