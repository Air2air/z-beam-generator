  title: Ph.D.
category: composite
chemicalProperties:
  formula: Cₙ/(C₂₁H₂₅ClO₅)ₙ (Carbon fiber/Epoxy matrix representative composition)
  materialType: composite
  symbol: CFRP
compatibility:
- Thermoset matrices (epoxy, vinyl ester, phenolic)
- Carbon fiber (PAN-based, pitch-based)
- Fiberglass (limited compatibility due to different absorption characteristics)
complexity: high
composition:
- 'Carbon fiber: 50-70% (by volume)'
- 'Epoxy resin matrix: 30-50% (typically DGEBA-based with hardeners)'
- 'Additives: <5% (release agents, fillers, catalysts)'
description: Laser cleaning of CFRP utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the structural integrity of the carbon fiber and epoxy matrix. The process exploits differential absorption characteristics between contaminants and the composite substrate, with optimal parameters carefully balanced to avoid matrix degradation (>300°C) or fiber damage.
difficultyScore: 5
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical solvent consumption
  description: Eliminates use of methylene chloride, acetone, and other hazardous solvents (reducing VOC emissions by 100% compared to chemical cleaning)
- benefit: Reduced waste generation
  description: Produces only captured particulate waste (typically <0.1% of material processed) versus chemical waste streams from traditional cleaning methods
