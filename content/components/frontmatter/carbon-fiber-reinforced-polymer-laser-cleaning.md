description: Technical overview of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), a high-performance
  composite material consisting of carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix, for
  laser cleaning. CFRP's unique combination of high strength and low weight makes
  it ideal for applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Laser cleaning
  of CFRP is a non-contact, precise method for removing surface contaminants, release
  agents, and preparing surfaces for bonding and painting. The process leverages laser
  ablation to ensure minimal damage to the underlying material while achieving high
  levels of surface cleanliness and readiness for further processing.
