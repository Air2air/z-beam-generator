caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex
    topography of particulate inclusions and amorphous oxide scales, which create
    a textured, matte appearance. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden,
    with only intermittent glimpses of the native cobalt's fine grain structure visible
    through cracks in the overlying deposits.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the contamination layer, revealing the
    pristine cobalt substrate. The surface now displays a clean, uniform grain structure
    with minimal micro-fissuring. The reflectivity is significantly increased, and
    the original metallic luster is restored, confirming the elimination of surface
    oxides and embedded particles.
