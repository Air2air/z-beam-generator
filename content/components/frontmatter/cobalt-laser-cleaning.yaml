caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous particulates and discontinuous oxide scales, which create
    a topographically complex and rough surface texture. The contaminants appear as dark, irregular patches that interrupt
    the underlying metallic substrate.


    The surface morphology is characterized by a lack of coherent structure, with the foreign material forming a porous, crust-like
    layer. This obscures the native grain structure of the cobalt and creates potential sites for further corrosion or adhesion.
    The irregular coverage suggests the contamination occurred through environmental exposure and particulate deposition rather
    than a uniform chemical reaction.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The previously dominant
    contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the intact, underlying cobalt substrate. The surface now exhibits
    the characteristic polycrystalline grain structure of the metal, with clear grain boundaries and a uniform, metallic appearance.


    The removal process has not damaged the base material. The original machining marks or surface finish from the component''s
    manufacture are now fully visible, confirming that only the superficial contamination was ablated. The reflectivity of
    the surface has increased significantly due to the exposure of the pristine metal, which has a native reflectivity of
    approximately 67% for near-infrared light.


    This results in a surface that is chemically clean and topographically defined, restoring the material''s inherent properties.
    The process successfully eliminated the contamination without inducing surface melting or micro-cracking, preserving the
    cobalt''s mechanical integrity for its intended application.'
