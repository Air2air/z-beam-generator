description: Technical overview of Ceramic Matrix Composites CMCs for laser cleaning.
  Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) are advanced materials known for their high strength-to-weight
  ratio, excellent thermal resistance, and exceptional durability. Laser cleaning
  of CMCs involves precise removal of surface contaminants without damaging the underlying
  material structure, leveraging the non-contact nature of laser ablation. This process
  ensures the integrity of the CMCs while preparing them for critical applications
  in aerospace and power generation, where performance and reliability are paramount.
