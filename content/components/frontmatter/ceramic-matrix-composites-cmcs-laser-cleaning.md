description: Laser cleaning of CMCs utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the ceramic matrix and reinforcing fibers. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the CMC substrate, with parameters carefully controlled to stay below the ablation threshold of the SiC matrix (~10 J/cm²) while effectively removing oxides, carbon deposits, and other surface layers.
