caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A porous, non-uniform oxide scale, approximately 5-15 µm thick, forms a
    crust over the substrate. Particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot and
    mineral dust, is embedded within this brittle matrix. The underlying lead's metallic
    luster is entirely absent, replaced by a topographically varied, matte surface
    with visible micro-cracking and pitting.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying
    lead substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey metallic appearance,
    with the original grain structure of the FCC crystalline metal faintly visible.
    The brittle oxide crust and embedded particulates have been completely ablated.


    The process has exposed minor, pre-existing surface features like grain boundaries
    and shallow rolling marks, confirming the removal was highly selective to the
    contaminants. The surface texture is significantly smoother, with the micro-cracking
    and pitting observed in the contaminated state eliminated.


    This results in a chemically pure, metallurgically clean surface with a low surface
    energy of approximately 470 mJ/m², optimized for subsequent processes like bonding
    or coating. The visual transformation confirms the precise, non-contact nature
    of the laser ablation process.'
