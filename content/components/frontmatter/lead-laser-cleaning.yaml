caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead surface is heavily obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A stratified crust, approximately 10-20 µm thick, adheres
    to the substrate. This layer consists of a porous matrix of lead carbonates and
    sulfates, intermixed with embedded particulate matter. The underlying lead's characteristic
    FCC crystalline structure is entirely hidden. The surface texture is highly irregular,
    with fissures and dendritic oxidation patterns propagating from initial nucleation
    sites. This heterogeneous layer significantly alters the surface's reflectivity
    and masks the native metallic properties of the soft lead substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native metallic state.
    At 500x magnification, the contamination crust has been completely ablated, revealing
    the underlying FCC crystalline grain structure of the pure lead. The surface now
    exhibits a uniform, micro-roughened texture with an average roughness (Ra) near
    0.1 µm, a direct result of the laser's selective interaction with the contaminants.
    The process has eliminated the stratified oxides and fissures, leaving a clean,
    homogenous surface. This restoration significantly increases reflectivity and
    provides a pristine, metallurgically pure substrate for subsequent applications
    or analysis.
