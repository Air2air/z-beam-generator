caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the chromium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter and a discontinuous film of oxides and adsorbed hydrocarbons.
    The underlying metallic substrate exhibits a loss of reflectivity, with its characteristic
    micro-texture masked by the contamination, which appears as dark, amorphous patches
    and localized, crust-like deposits.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the chromium surface to its native state.
    The previously obscuring contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing
    the substrate''s fine micro-texture and restoring its high optical reflectivity.
    The process has not induced surface melting or significant topographical alteration,
    preserving the original grain structure.


    The surface now displays a uniform, clean metallic appearance with clearly defined
    grain boundaries. The high reflectivity (approximately 67% at 1064 nm) is evident,
    with a mirror-like sheen at the microscopic level. The cleaning process has successfully
    removed the contaminants without compromising the protective chromium oxide layer,
    ensuring the material''s inherent corrosion resistance remains intact. The result
    is a surface that is visually and functionally pristine, meeting the stringent
    requirements for high-performance applications.'
