caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the chromium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a discontinuous film of oxides and adsorbed hydrocarbons. The underlying metallic substrate exhibits a loss of reflectivity, with its characteristic micro-texture masked by the contamination, which appears as dark, amorphous patches and localized, crust-like deposits.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the chromium surface to its native state. The previously obscuring contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing the substrate''s fine micro-texture and restoring its high optical reflectivity. The process has not induced surface melting or significant topographical alteration, preserving the original grain structure.


    The surface now displays a uniform, clean metallic appearance with clearly defined grain boundaries. The high reflectivity (approximately 67% at 1064 nm) is evident, with a mirror-like sheen at the microscopic level. The cleaning process has successfully removed the contaminants without compromising the protective chromium oxide layer, ensuring the material''s inherent corrosion resistance remains intact. The result is a surface that is visually and functionally pristine, meeting the stringent requirements for high-performance applications.'
