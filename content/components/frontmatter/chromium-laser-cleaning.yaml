        research_basis: Chromium forms a highly adherent, self-healing chromium oxide
          (Cr₂O₃) passive layer that provides excellent resistance to atmospheric
          corrosion, water, and many oxidizing chemicals. Its primary limitation is
          susceptibility to reducing acids, which prevents a perfect 9-10 rating reserved
          for metals like titanium or tantalum in broader environments.

        research_basis: Chromium forms a protective Cr₂O₃ scale, but above approximately
          980°C, this scale begins to volatilize as CrO₃, leading to a breakdown in
          oxidation resistance and accelerated attack. This temperature is widely
          cited in materials science literature as the upper limit for protective
          behavior in air.

        research_basis: The provided flexural strength is for high-purity, annealed
          chromium. The value is derived from standard bend tests and is consistent
          with the brittle nature of chromium metal at room temperature, which results
          in a flexural strength significantly lower than its compressive strength
          but higher than its tensile strength in some conditions.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed chromium is significantly
          lower than its tensile strength due to its brittle nature. The cited value
          is a typical room-temperature compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) for
          high-purity chromium, as reported in a leading materials science reference.
          The hardness value provided (1060 MPa) is a pressure-based measurement and
          is not a direct substitute for compressive strength, which is a distinct
          mechanical property.
