description: Polyester Resin Composites are versatile materials used in various industrial
  applications, particularly in automotive and aerospace sectors. Laser cleaning of
  these composites involves non-contact surface treatments like laser ablation to
  remove contaminants, ensuring the surface is ready for subsequent processes like
  painting and bonding. The process uses specific laser parameters, including a wavelength
  of 1064nm and a fluence range of 0.5-5 J/cm², to achieve optimal cleaning without
  damaging the composite structure.
