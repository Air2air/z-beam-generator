caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the concrete surface is dominated by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately
    50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter, primarily carbon soot and mineral dust,
    trapped within the concrete''s porous matrix. The surface texture is highly irregular, with contaminants filling the natural
    valleys and pores of the substrate, obscuring the underlying aggregate.


    The contamination does not form a uniform film but rather a complex, stratified structure. A darker, carbon-rich upper
    layer masks the concrete''s natural coloration and light-reflective properties. Beneath this, finer silicates and clays
    have penetrated the microstructure, binding to the calcium silicate hydrate gel. This occludes the surface''s inherent
    roughness and creates a visually heterogeneous, mottled appearance that compromises the substrate''s original profile.'
  afterText: The laser-cleaned surface reveals a complete transformation. The thick, occluding contamination layer has been
    entirely removed, exposing the original concrete microstructure. The surface now displays the intrinsic texture of the
    cement paste and aggregate, with open pores and a clear, unadulterated profile. The visual homogeneity and reflectivity
    are restored to the substrate's native state.
