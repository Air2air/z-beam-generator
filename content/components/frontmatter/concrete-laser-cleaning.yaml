caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the concrete surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of embedded
    particulate matter, such as carbonaceous soot and silica dust, bound within a
    matrix of hydrocarbon residues and biological growth like fungal hyphae. The original
    surface texture, characterized by the aggregate profile and cement paste porosity,
    is largely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a non-uniform, stratified pattern, filling the natural
    10-15% surface porosity. This layer creates a weak boundary, compromising the
    adhesion of any new coating or treatment. The presence of moisture, held within
    this porous layer, can facilitate further chemical degradation of the underlying
    cementitious matrix, threatening the long-term integrity of the material.'
  afterText: 'Post-cleaning analysis at 500x magnification reveals the restoration
    of the intrinsic concrete substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed, exposing the original micro-texture of the cement paste and the mineral
    aggregates. The surface porosity is now fully open and clear, with no evidence
    of residual film or thermal damage to the cementitious binder.


    The ablation process has left a clean, sound surface with a peak-to-valley profile
    consistent with the aggregate hardness differential. This state provides an optimal
    substrate profile for subsequent protective coatings or structural assessments,
    ensuring maximum adhesion and revealing the true condition of the concrete.'
