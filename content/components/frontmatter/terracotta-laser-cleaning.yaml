    description: "Compressive strength of terracotta masonry is primarily governed by its porous, vitrified microstructure formed from fired clay. The strength depends on clay composition, firing temperature (typically 900-1100\xB0C), and resulting porosity, which typically ranges from 5-20%. Failure occurs through brittle fracture along microcracks and pores."
