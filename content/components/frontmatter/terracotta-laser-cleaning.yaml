subtitle: Terracotta is a porous, low-fired clay with a delicate, often uneven surface
  glaze. This requires careful laser calibration to clean effectively without damaging
  the underlying material or its finish.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. A porous crust of gypsum and
    carbon particulates is anchored within the material's inherent 15% porosity. This
    layer exhibits micro-fracturing and conceals the original fired-clay microstructure,
    including fine-grained mineral inclusions and the subtle, vitrified surface texture.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has selectively removed the contamination crust, revealing
    the intact terracotta substrate. The original surface texture, characterized by
    a fine-grained, vitrified matrix and distinct mineral inclusions, is now fully
    exposed. The process has cleared the material's micro-porosity without inducing
    micro-fractures or thermal alteration to the underlying clay body.
