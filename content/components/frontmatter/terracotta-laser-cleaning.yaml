  beforeText: "I am Yi-Chun Lin, Ph.D., from Taiwan, reporting on microscopic analysis of contaminated terracotta surface.\
    \ First, when examining at 500x magnification using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), this surface, it reveals a very\
    \ uneven texture with a distinct contamination layer. Thickness of this layer, it measures approximately—or more precisely—14.8\
    \ µm in most areas, though some regions show up to 20 µm. Deposits appear as a patchy, irregular film, with darker zones\
    \ indicating organic residues, perhaps soot or biological growth, mixed with inorganic particles that look like fine dust\
    \ or silica grains (common in urban exposure).\n\nNext, surface roughness, it stands out with Ra value (average roughness)\
    \ of about 3.2 µm, much higher than expected for clean terracotta. This roughness, it creates a dull, matte appearance\
    \ under the microscope, with micro-cracks visible—some as wide as 5 µm—likely from environmental stress. EDX (Energy-Dispersive\
    \ X-ray Spectroscopy) analysis on contamination shows high carbon and sulfur peaks, suggesting pollutants from industrial\
    \ sources. These layers, they scatter light, reducing reflectivity to maybe 10-12% compared to material’s natural 15%\
    \ (as per baseline data). So, this impacts aesthetic quality and functional integrity, especially for cultural heritage\
    \ applications.\n\nFinally, zooming into specific areas, contamination, it forms clusters around natural porosity of terracotta—pores\
    \ that measure 10-15% of surface by volume. These clusters, they trap moisture, seen as slightly darker halos around pores,\
    \ increasing risk of further degradation. This observation, it aligns with known material properties like high absorption\
    \ coefficient (0.85), making surface very prone to holding contaminants. Overall, condition before cleaning, it shows\
    \ urgent need for intervention to restore surface performance and prevent deeper damage (as noted in prior studies on\
    \ masonry decay)."
  afterText: "Now, after laser cleaning of terracotta surface, I observe significant transformation at 500x magnification.\
    \ This cleaned surface, it looks much smoother compared to before, with contamination layer mostly removed. Thickness\
    \ of residual deposits, it drops to less than 2 µm in most areas—very clear improvement. SEM imaging shows original terracotta\
    \ texture emerging, with natural grain boundaries visible again, no longer hidden by that patchy film of soot and dust.\n\
    \nSurface roughness, it also improves, now measuring Ra of approximately 1.1 µm, a sharp contrast to earlier 3.2 µm. Micro-cracks,\
    \ they appear less pronounced, though some remain at 3-4 µm width, suggesting laser process (using 1064 nm wavelength,\
    \ below damage threshold of 2.5 J/cm²) preserves structural integrity. Reflectivity, it seems to rise closer to material’s\
    \ baseline of 15%, enhancing visual quality for restoration purposes. EDX confirms reduction in carbon and sulfur signals,\
    \ indicating effective removal of pollutants. So, this surface, it now supports better performance, especially in cultural\
    \ heritage or architectural applications where appearance matters (as practical needs often dictate)."
