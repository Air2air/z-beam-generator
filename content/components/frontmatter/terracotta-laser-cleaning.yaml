caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous
    crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres to the substrate. This layer is a composite of particulate matter,
    such as soot and dust, cemented by gypsum and other salts, which have crystallized within the material''s inherent porosity.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with crystalline deposits filling the natural micro-pores of the fired clay.
    These efflorescent salts create a rough, scaly topography that masks the original terracotta surface. The contamination
    exhibits poor adhesion in some areas, showing micro-fractures and delamination, indicating a weak boundary layer that
    is mechanically unsound and visually disruptive.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The contamination
    crust has been entirely removed, exposing the original, unaltered terracotta substrate. The intrinsic micro-texture of
    the fired clay is now fully visible, with its characteristic network of open pores and grain structure clearly defined.


    The process has successfully ablated the surface contaminants without damaging the underlying material. There is no evidence
    of micro-fracturing or thermal alteration, confirming the laser''s selective removal. The surface now presents a uniform,
    clean profile, restoring the authentic, porous morphology of the terracotta.'
