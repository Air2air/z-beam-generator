        research_basis: Terracotta demonstrates excellent corrosion resistance to
          atmospheric and environmental degradation due to its vitrified ceramic nature.
          As a fired clay product, it is chemically inert and highly resistant to
          acid rain, pollution, and weathering. ASTM standards classify brick and
          terracotta as having "severe weather" (SW) grade for maximum resistance
          to moisture penetration and frost action, indicating superior durability
          in corrosive environments. The material maintains structural integrity when
          exposed to common environmental corrosives that would degrade metals or
          other masonry materials.

        source: ASTM C62-17 "Standard Specification for Building Brick (Solid Masonry
          Units Made from Clay or Shale)"
        research_basis: While terracotta itself is not a standardized high-temperature
          ceramic, it is a fired clay product. ASTM C62 classifies brick (clay masonry)
          for severe weathering (SW) grade, which must withstand freeze-thaw cycles,
          implying high structural integrity after firing. Industrial and historical
          sources (e.g., National Terracotta Society, 1920s) specify that architectural
          terracotta is fired between 1000-1200°C, creating a stable, oxidized ceramic
          body. Its maximum continuous service temperature in air is limited not by
          oxidation but by the onset of vitrification and loss of mechanical strength,
          beginning around 800°C for typical clay compositions. This is well below
          its original firing temperature, ensuring no further oxidation occurs.

          and Structural Clay Tile," Table 4 - Physical Requirements, Grade SW (Severe
          Weathering)
        research_basis: Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) is a standard property
          for masonry materials. For fired clay products like terracotta, the flexural
          strength is typically 15-25% of its compressive strength. The cited ASTM
          standard, a primary authority for clay-based masonry, lists a minimum modulus
          of rupture of 8.3 MPa (1200 psi) for severe weathering brick, which aligns
          with the derived range from the known compressive strength (45.0 MPa * 0.2
          = ~9.0 MPa). The value of 8.0 MPa is a conservative, well-attested estimate
          for a typical terracotta body.

        research_basis: Direct fracture toughness (K_IC) data for terracotta is scarce.
          This value is derived from testing of mudstone, a material with a similar

          The cited study provides a K_IC range of 1.0-1.2 MPa·√m for such materials,
