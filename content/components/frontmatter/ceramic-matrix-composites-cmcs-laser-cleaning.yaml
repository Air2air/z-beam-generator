caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the CMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    soot and silicate deposits, exhibits a coarse, agglomerated texture that masks
    the underlying composite structure. The deposits form irregular, dendritic patterns,
    preferentially accumulating within the micro-porosity of the CMC, which increases
    surface roughness to an estimated 8-12 µm Ra. This contamination layer significantly
    alters the surface's thermal and optical properties, impeding performance.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the complete restoration
    of the intrinsic CMC surface topography. The SiC matrix and reinforcing fibers
    are fully exposed, with surface roughness returning to its baseline of approximately
    1.2 µm Ra. The laser process has selectively ablated the contamination layer without
    damaging the underlying composite, as evidenced by the sharp, well-defined edges
    of the fibers and the open, clean pores. The surface now presents its original,
    engineered morphology, characterized by a uniform, granular matrix texture and
    distinct fiber architecture.
