caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the CMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    soot and oxide particles, fills the inherent surface porosity and masks the underlying
    composite weave. The texture is agglomerated and discontinuous, creating a topographical
    map of deposits that compromises the true surface morphology and increases effective
    roughness.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic CMC topography. The contamination
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the distinct, woven architecture of the SiC
    fibers within the SiC matrix. The surface porosity, previously clogged, is now
    clearly visible as fine, interconnected voids.


    The process has significantly reduced the average surface roughness, measured
    at less than 3.5 µm Ra, by eliminating the particulate agglomerates. This exposes
    the material''s true, engineered texture without inducing micro-cracks or observable
    ablation of the underlying composite, confirming a selective removal process.'
