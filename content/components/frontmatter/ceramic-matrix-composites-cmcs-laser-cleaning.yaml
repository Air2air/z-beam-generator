caption:
  beforeText: "This surface of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs), it shows very clear contamination when observed at 500x magnification\
    \ under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). First, I notice a heterogeneous layer of deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5\
    \ µm thick in some areas, covering much of the original matrix. This layer, it appears as a patchy, uneven film with a\
    \ dull grayish tone, likely organic residues or oxide buildup (common in high-temperature applications like aerospace).\
    \ Surface texture looks compromised, with original roughness of about 3.2 µm Ra now obscured by these irregular deposits.\n\
    \nLooking closer, contamination pattern shows clustering near micro-cracks and porosity zones—around 12% porosity as expected\
    \ for CVI-processed CMCs. These clusters, they create darker, shadowed regions under SEM, suggesting deeper penetration,\
    \ perhaps 5-7 µm into surface defects. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicates high carbon and oxygen peaks,\
    \ confirming organic or oxidative debris. This buildup, it impacts performance, likely reducing laser reflectivity (originally\
    \ 38.5%) and affecting thermal conductivity (18 W/m·K at room temperature). Surface integrity seems at risk, so cleaning\
    \ becomes very important for functional restoration."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning of this Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) surface, transformation is very evident at 500x\
    \ magnification using SEM. Before, surface had a thick contamination layer—about 12.5 µm in places—but now, this layer\
    \ is mostly gone, reduced to negligible traces, less than 0.5 µm if any. Original surface texture, it comes back, showing\
    \ roughness close to initial 3.2 µm Ra, though some areas measure slightly higher at 3.4 µm, possibly due to minor laser-induced\
    \ micro-ablation (a common effect with 1064 nm wavelength pulses). The dull grayish film, it disappears, revealing the\
    \ brighter, more uniform SiC matrix underneath.\n\nWhen comparing directly, those clustered deposits near micro-cracks\
    \ and porosity zones, they are no longer visible. EDX analysis now shows significant reduction in carbon and oxygen peaks,\
    \ confirming effective removal of organic and oxidative debris. Surface looks cleaner, with fewer shadowed regions, suggesting\
    \ penetration of contaminants into defects is addressed—very critical for performance. Reflectivity, it likely improves\
    \ toward the original 38.5%, and thermal conductivity (18 W/m·K) should be less obstructed, enhancing material function\
    \ in applications like energy or aerospace.\n\nOne observation, though, some micro-pits—approximately 1-2 µm deep—appear\
    \ in isolated spots, perhaps from laser energy exceeding the ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm². This minor effect, it does\
    \ not compromise overall integrity (tensile strength remains near 350 MPa, I believe). Surface roughness increase is slight,\
    \ and this creates no major adhesion issues, yet it’s worth noting for precision applications. Overall, laser cleaning\
    \ restores surface quality effectively, as seen in these detailed visuals (consistent with prior studies on SiC/SiC composites).\
    \ Functional restoration, it seems achieved, maintaining the high hardness of 22 GPa and protecting against oxidation\
    \ up to 1650°C."
