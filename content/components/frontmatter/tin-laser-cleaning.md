description: Tin, symbol Sn, is a soft, malleable, silvery-white metal widely used
  in various industries for its corrosion resistance and solderability. In laser cleaning
  applications, tin's low melting point and high reflectivity at certain wavelengths
  necessitate precise control of laser parameters to effectively remove surface contaminants
  while preserving the material's integrity. The use of pulsed lasers at 1064nm wavelength
  and fluences between 0.5-5 J/cm² allows for efficient ablation of oxidation and
  other residues from tin surfaces, crucial for applications in electronics and automotive
  sectors.
