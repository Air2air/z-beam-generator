description: Tin laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface contaminants while preserving the soft tin substrate. The process exploits tin's low melting point (232°C) and high reflectivity, requiring optimized parameters to achieve effective cleaning without melting or surface damage.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical waste generation
  description: Eliminates use of acidic cleaners (e.g., hydrochloric acid) and solvent-based degreasers typically used in tin surface preparation, reducing hazardous waste by 100%
- benefit: Reduced energy consumption
  description: Laser cleaning consumes 60-70% less energy compared to electrochemical cleaning processes for tin surfaces, with typical power consumption of 2-4 kWh/m²
