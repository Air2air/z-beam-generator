        research_basis: Vanadium has moderate corrosion resistance due to a protective
          oxide film that forms in air, but it is susceptible to attack in oxidizing
          acids, halogens, and alkaline solutions. It shows good resistance to neutral
          chloride solutions and some organic acids, but overall performance is limited
          compared to more corrosion-resistant metals like titanium or zirconium,
          placing it in the lower-mid range of the scale.

        research_basis: ASM International states that unalloyed vanadium has poor
          oxidation resistance above about 660°C (1200°F) in air, with the rate of
          oxidation becoming rapid and catastrophic. This temperature represents the
          upper limit for significant oxidation initiation, not a safe service temperature.
          For continuous service, a much lower temperature would be required.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Vanadium and Vanadium Alloys"'
        research_basis: Flexural strength for pure vanadium is not a commonly reported
          property, as its mechanical behavior is typically characterized by tensile
          or yield strength. The provided value is an engineering estimate derived
          from the relationship between tensile strength and flexural strength for
          body-centered cubic metals, using a typical tensile strength range of 345-485
          MPa for annealed, high-purity vanadium. The lower end of this range is cited
          as a conservative estimate for flexural strength, as bending failure typically
          initiates at the tensile surface.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed vanadium is approximately
          485 MPa. This value is for high-purity (99.8%) material at room temperature.
          The compressive strength is significantly lower than its tensile strength
          due to the body-centered cubic structure of the metal, which is prone to
          yielding under compression.
