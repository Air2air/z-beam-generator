caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter, creating a topographically
    complex and textured landscape. The contaminants disrupt the underlying metallic structure, presenting as dark, amorphous
    patches and localized corrosion pits.


    The surface exhibits a matte, non-reflective appearance due to the light-scattering properties of the porous contamination.
    The crystalline grain structure of the vanadium substrate is entirely masked. The layer''s variable thickness and adhesion
    suggest a mixture of organic residues and inorganic oxides, which have fused to the base metal, compromising the surface
    integrity and creating potential sites for further degradation.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying polycrystalline structure
    of the vanadium substrate. The surface is now characterized by a uniform, reflective finish where the distinct boundaries
    of individual metallic grains are clearly visible. The previously observed pits and amorphous deposits have been eliminated,
    restoring a continuous, clean metallic surface free of embedded contaminants.
