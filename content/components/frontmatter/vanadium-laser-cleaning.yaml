caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer consists of embedded oxides and carbonaceous deposits, forming a textured, matte topography. The
    underlying metal's grain structure is entirely concealed by this discontinuous, particulate-laden film, which exhibits
    micro-cracking and localized spallation.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully restored the native metallic surface, revealing the fine, polygonal grain structure
    characteristic of vanadium''s body-centered cubic lattice. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, with no
    residual oxide islands or embedded particulates.


    The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey metallic finish with clearly defined grain boundaries. The process has
    achieved this result without inducing surface melting or heat-affected zone microcracking, preserving the substrate''s
    integrity.


    This pristine surface condition, free from the 5-20 µm contamination layer, ensures optimal performance for subsequent
    operations in demanding applications, providing a clean interface for bonding, coating, or service.'
