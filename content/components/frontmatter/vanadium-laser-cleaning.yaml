caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the vanadium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of adherent
    oxide scales and embedded particulate matter, creating a topographically complex
    and textured surface. The underlying BCC crystalline structure of the vanadium
    is entirely masked. Contamination patterns are irregular, with areas of concentrated
    carbonaceous deposits and localized pitting, which scatter light and create a
    matte, dark appearance.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, metallic vanadium substrate.
    The contamination layer is entirely removed, exposing the native BCC grain structure.
    The surface is now uniform and smooth, with a significant reduction in light-scattering
    features, restoring its inherent metallic reflectivity.
