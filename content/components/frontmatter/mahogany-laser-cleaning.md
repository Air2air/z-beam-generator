description: Technical overview of Mahogany, a dense hardwood prized for its durability
  and aesthetic appeal, for laser cleaning. Laser cleaning of Mahogany involves the
  use of precise laser parameters to remove surface contaminants without damaging
  the wood's structure. The process leverages Mahogany's natural properties, such
  as its density and thermal conductivity, to ensure effective cleaning while preserving
  the wood's integrity.
