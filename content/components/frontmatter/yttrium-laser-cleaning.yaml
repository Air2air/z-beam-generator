  description: Yttrium's low thermal conductivity (10-17 W/(m·K)) minimizes parasitic
    heat transfer during laser ablation, concentrating photon energy for contaminant
    removal and reducing the total power required for effective cleaning.
- benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Yttrium's low thermal conductivity (10-17 W/(m·K)) enables precise
    laser ablation with minimal heat dispersion, preventing the vaporization of substrates
    and reducing the generation of hazardous airborne particulates. This targeted
    material removal eliminates the need for chemical solvents or abrasive media,
    directly improving air quality by suppressing fugitive dust and volatile organic
    compound (VOC) emissions.

- metric: Contaminant Removal Efficiency
  description: Contaminant Removal Efficiency quantifies the mass or area percentage
    of surface contaminants removed by Yttrium laser ablation, measured via before/after
    mass spectrometry or microscopy, accounting for the material's low Vickers hardness
    (0.57 GPa) to prevent substrate damage.

  typicalRanges: 95-99.9% depending on application and material
- metric: Processing Speed
  description: Processing Speed quantifies the area cleaned per unit time (cm²/s)
    by the Yttrium laser, where the optimal rate is calibrated to the material's specific
    Vickers hardness (0.5684 GPa) to achieve efficient contaminant removal without

- metric: Surface Quality Preservation
  description: Surface Quality Preservation quantifies the absence of laser-induced
    surface damage, such as micro-cracking or melting, on the yttrium substrate, which
    is critical given its low hardness (~0.57 GPa). This is typically measured by
    quantifying the surface roughness (Sa) post-cleaning and verifying the integrity
    of the base material through microscopic analysis.

- metric: Thermal Damage Avoidance
  description: Thermal Damage Avoidance quantifies the prevention of surface hardening
    or microstructural alteration in yttrium (Vickers hardness ~0.57 GPa) by maintaining
    the laser energy density below the threshold for recrystallization or phase change.
    This is verified through post-process microhardness testing and metallographic
    analysis to confirm the base material properties are preserved.
