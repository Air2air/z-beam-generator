caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the travertine surface is obscured by a dense,
    stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of carbonaceous particulates, hydrocarbon deposits, and microbiological growth,
    fills the natural pores and voids characteristic of the stone. The underlying
    calcite matrix is largely hidden, with only the highest crystalline peaks visible,
    creating a heavily textured and irregular topography that compromises the stone's
    intrinsic appearance and promotes further decay.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation.
    The contamination layer has been selectively ablated, exposing the pristine, micro-crystalline
    structure of the calcite matrix. The stone's inherent porosity is now clearly
    defined, with open voids and a uniform surface texture. The process has successfully
    restored the original substrate without inducing micro-fractures or thermal alteration,
    confirming the removal of obscuring deposits and the preservation of the stone's
    integrity.
