        research_basis: Travertine is a porous, calcium carbonate-based stone that
          is highly susceptible to acid rain, chemical weathering, and freeze-thaw
          cycles. While durable in dry conditions, it has poor resistance to environmental
          corrosion compared to granite or quartzite. ASTM classifications place travertine
          among the least durable natural stones for exterior applications in corrosive
          environments.

          of Carbonate Rocks"
        research_basis: Travertine, as a form of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), undergoes
          chemical decomposition rather than oxidation. The primary thermal degradation
          begins with calcination (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂), which starts around 400-500°C
          in air. NIST studies on carbonate stone decomposition identify 480°C as
          the temperature where significant, rapid mass loss begins under standard
          atmospheric conditions, marking the practical upper service limit.

        research_basis: This study specifically tested Turkish travertine varieties
          using a standardized 4-point bend test (EN 12372). The reported flexural
          strength values for travertine ranged from approximately 6.5 MPa to 12.5
          MPa, with a central, representative value of 9.5 MPa. This is a peer-reviewed,

          Dimension Stone
        research_basis: Travertine is a type of limestone, and its compressive strength
          is well-documented in construction material standards. The American Society
          for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard C170 specifies the test method,
          and values for travertine typically range from approximately 50 MPa to over
          100 MPa, with 80 MPa being a representative, commonly cited average for
          sound, structural-grade stone. The provided physical properties (density,
          hardness) are consistent with this strength range.
