  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated travertine surface reveals a complex, stratified layer of foreign material.
    A discontinuous soiling layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick, fills the natural pores and fissures characteristic
    of this porous stone. This layer consists of fine particulate matter, carbonaceous deposits, and biological growth, which
    obscure the underlying crystalline structure of the calcite.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contaminants forming a crust that bridges across the micro-topography. This
    crust exhibits a cracked, desiccated appearance, indicating adhesion to the stone substrate. The original travertine surface
    is no longer visible in many areas, as the contamination has created a continuous film that alters the stone''s inherent
    reflectivity and color at a microscopic level.'
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the original stone substrate.
    The contaminant crust has been entirely removed, exposing the clean, intact calcite crystals and reopening the stone's
    natural porosity. The surface now displays its inherent micro-texture without the bridging effect of the soiling layer,
    resulting in a clear, well-defined pore structure and restored surface geometry.
