description: Silver (Ag) is a precious metal widely used in electronics and jewelry
  due to its high electrical and thermal conductivity. Laser cleaning of silver effectively
  removes oxides and contaminants without altering the underlying material, making
  it ideal for delicate surfaces. The process utilizes a 1064nm wavelength with a
  fluence range of 0.5-5 J/cm² to achieve precise cleaning and restoration.
