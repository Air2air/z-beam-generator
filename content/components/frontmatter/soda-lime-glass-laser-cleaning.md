description: Laser cleaning of soda-lime glass utilizes pulsed near-infrared radiation to selectively ablate surface contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The process relies on the differential absorption between the contaminant layer and the glass, with careful control of fluence to remain below the damage threshold of the bulk material (~5-10 J/cm²).
