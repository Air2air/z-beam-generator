caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the zinc surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer appears as a topographical map of debris, with agglomerated particles of oxides and carbonaceous
    soot embedded in a matrix of industrial grime. The underlying metallic structure is completely hidden.


    The surface texture is rough and porous, with visible micro-cracks running through the contamination crust. This compromised
    layer, which appears dark gray and blotchy, creates a barrier that would severely inhibit any subsequent process like
    coating adhesion or electrical contact, as it prevents direct interaction with the pure zinc substrate.'
  afterText: 'The transformation is dramatic. The thick, obscuring contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing
    the true underlying zinc microstructure. The surface now exhibits the characteristic fine, granular pattern of the metal''s
    hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystalline structure, visible for the first time.


    Direct comparison shows the elimination of all micro-cracks and porous crust, replaced by a uniform, clean metallic surface.
    The reflectivity has increased significantly; the surface now has a consistent, bright luster instead of the former dull,
    blotchy appearance. This confirms the complete ablation of the contaminant layer without damaging the zinc substrate.


    This pristine surface, now free of insulating or weakly-bonded layers, provides an ideal foundation. It ensures optimal
    conditions for processes like painting, plating, or soldering, as the laser has restored a perfectly clean and reactive
    metallic interface.'
