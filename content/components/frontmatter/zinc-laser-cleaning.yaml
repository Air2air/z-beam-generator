caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zinc surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A porous, amorphous oxide/hydroxide matrix, measuring 5-15 µm thick, forms
    the base stratum. This is overlaid with localized carbonaceous deposits from environmental
    exposure and embedded particulate matter, primarily silica and alumina, from industrial
    fallout. The underlying zinc substrate's characteristic hexagonal close-packed
    (HCP) crystalline structure is entirely concealed. The surface texture is irregular
    and fractured, with contamination filling the natural grain boundaries and micro-impurities
    of the base metal.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, metallic zinc substrate.
    The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the fine, polygonal
    grain structure characteristic of the HCP lattice. The surface is now uniformly
    textured with minimal micro-pitting, and the original metallic luster is restored.
    Grain boundaries are clearly defined and free of occluding oxides, confirming
    a return to the base material's inherent properties.
