subtitle: Zinc has a lower melting point and develops a tenacious oxide layer compared
  to other non-ferrous metals. These traits require careful control of laser power
  and pulse settings to avoid surface damage while effectively removing corrosion.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zinc surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A porous, amorphous oxide/hydroxide matrix, approximately 5-15 µm thick,
    forms the base. This is overlaid with localized carbonaceous soot deposits and
    embedded particulate matter, creating a topographically rough and irregular surface.
    The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely concealed. The contamination
    exhibits a non-uniform, patchy distribution, with areas of thick crust formation
    adjacent to regions of thinner, more adherent tarnish.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the native zinc surface. The contamination
    layer is completely ablated, revealing the underlying metallic grain structure
    with high clarity. The surface is now topographically uniform, exhibiting only
    the natural micro-texture of the base metal. The reflectivity is significantly
    increased, confirming the removal of light-absorbing oxides and particulates.
