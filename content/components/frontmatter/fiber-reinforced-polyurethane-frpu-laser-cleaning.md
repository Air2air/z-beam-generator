description: Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane (FRPU) is a composite material valued for
  its durability and resistance. In laser cleaning applications, FRPU's properties
  allow for effective removal of surface contaminants and coatings without compromising
  the structural integrity of the material. The use of a 1064nm wavelength laser with
  a fluence range of 1.0–10 J/cm² and pulse duration of 10-200ns facilitates precise
  ablation and cleaning, making it ideal for automotive and aerospace industries where
  precision and surface quality are paramount.
