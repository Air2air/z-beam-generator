description: Technical overview of Ash, a versatile wood material, for laser cleaning.
  Ash, known for its strength and flexibility, is suitable for laser cleaning due
  to its moderate density and thermal properties. When subjected to laser ablation,
  Ash can be effectively cleaned of surface contaminants with minimal damage to the
  underlying wood structure, making it ideal for both woodworking and conservation
  applications.
