caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated MDF surface is dominated by a non-uniform layer of particulate and
    organic debris. This contamination layer, measuring between 5-15 micrometers thick, adheres to and partially occludes
    the underlying wood fibers. The debris consists of agglomerated particles, ranging from sub-micrometer dust to larger
    10-micrometer fragments, creating a discontinuous film.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with the contamination filling the natural porous structure of the MDF. The fibrous
    substrate is partially visible through thinner areas of the layer, while thicker deposits completely mask the underlying
    material. The contaminant exhibits poor adhesion in some regions, showing micro-cracking and delamination from the MDF
    surface, which has an intrinsic roughness of approximately 3.5 micrometers.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The contaminant layer
    has been entirely removed, revealing the intact, undamaged MDF substrate beneath. The characteristic porous structure
    of the medium-density fiberboard is now fully exposed, with individual wood fibers and the resin binder matrix clearly
    visible and free of foreign material.


    The cleaning process has restored the original surface topography, with the typical MDF surface roughness of 3.5 micrometers
    Ra now measurable and consistent. No residual contamination is observed within the pores or on the fiber surfaces. The
    laser parameters were precisely controlled to remain below the material''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm², ensuring selective
    removal of contaminants without damaging the lignin or cellulose components of the wood fibers, preserving the structural
    integrity of the surface.'
