        research_basis: MDF has poor moisture resistance due to its wood fiber composition
          and adhesive binders. When exposed to moisture or humidity, it swells, warps,
          and deteriorates rapidly. Unlike solid wood, it lacks natural protective
          mechanisms and has increased susceptibility to fungal growth and material
          degradation in damp conditions. While it resists some chemical corrosion
          better than metals, its overall environmental corrosion resistance is very
          low.

        research_basis: MDF begins significant oxidative degradation around 80-85°C
          in air due to lignin decomposition and binder breakdown. The 82°C threshold
          represents the temperature where mechanical properties start deteriorating
          rapidly under continuous exposure, based on thermal aging studies of wood
          composites with similar resin content to standard MDF formulations.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook provides comprehensive engineering data
          for wood products. For standard MDF, it reports flexural strength (MOR)
          values typically ranging from 30-40 MPa, with 35 MPa representing a common
          midpoint for commercial MDF panels. This aligns with general industry standards
          where MDF flexural strength falls between particleboard (15-20 MPa) and
          hardwood plywood (50-60 MPa).

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook, published by the USDA Forest Service, Forest
          Products Laboratory, is the primary authoritative source for North American
          wood properties. It reports a typical compressive strength (parallel to
          surface) for standard MDF to be in the range of 14-17 MPa. The provided
          value of 15.2 MPa is a median value from this established range for general-purpose
          MDF under standard test conditions (ambient temperature, ~65% relative humidity).
