  description: Lanthanum laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste by utilizing the
    material's high thermal conductivity (13.4 W/(m·K)) to efficiently ablate contaminants
    through rapid, localized heating, avoiding the chemical solvents traditionally
    required for precision cleaning in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing.
  quantifiedBenefits: Lanthanum laser cleaning eliminates 100% of chemical waste,
    reduces operational costs by 30%, and cuts cleaning time by 50%.
- benefit: Water Usage Reduction
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Lanthanum's low thermal conductivity (13.4 W/(m·K)) enables efficient
    laser energy absorption, minimizing the heat-affected zone and eliminating the
    need for water-based cooling or post-process rinsing that traditional abrasive
    methods require.
- benefit: Energy Efficiency
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Lanthanum's low thermal conductivity (13.4 W/(m·K)) minimizes conductive
    heat transfer to the substrate during laser cleaning, concentrating photon energy
    for efficient contaminant removal and reducing overall power consumption. This
    intrinsic material property enables high-efficiency ablation with less wasted
    thermal energy, lowering the operational energy footprint.
- benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Lanthanum's low thermal conductivity (13.4 W/(m·K)) minimizes energy
    dispersion into the substrate, enabling efficient contaminant removal at lower
    laser power. This precise, low-power ablation significantly reduces the generation
    of airborne particulates and fumes compared to conventional cleaning methods.

outcomeMetrics:
- metric: Contaminant Removal Efficiency
  description: Contaminant Removal Efficiency quantifies the mass of surface contaminants
    removed from Lanthanum substrates, measured via before/after mass spectrometry
    to avoid altering the soft (0.363 GPa) and reactive rare-earth surface. The metric
    is highly dependent on the adhesion strength of the specific contaminant, as the
    low hardness of Lanthanum makes it susceptible to substrate damage during cleaning.

  - Chemical analysis
  - Mass spectrometry

  - Contamination type
  - Adhesion strength
  - Surface geometry
  units: []
  typicalRanges: 95-99.9% depending on application and material
- metric: Processing Speed
  description: Processing Speed quantifies the rate of surface area cleaned per unit
    time (e.g., mm²/s), determined by optimizing laser fluence and repetition rate
    to ablate lanthanum without exceeding its 0.363 GPa hardness threshold, which
    would induce plastic deformation.

- metric: Surface Quality Preservation
  description: Surface Quality Preservation quantifies the absence of laser-induced
    surface damage, such as pitting or micro-fissures, on the soft lanthanum substrate
    (0.363 GPa Vickers hardness), assessed through post-process microscopic analysis
    and surface profilometry to ensure material integrity is maintained.

- metric: Thermal Damage Avoidance
  description: Thermal Damage Avoidance quantifies the preservation of the base lanthanum
    metal's mechanical integrity, specifically its low Vickers hardness (~0.36 GPa),
    by minimizing microstructural alteration during laser cleaning. This is measured
    by confirming the absence of localized hardening or recast layers through post-process
    microhardness testing and metallographic analysis.
