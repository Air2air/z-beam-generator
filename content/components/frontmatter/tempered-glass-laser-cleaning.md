description: Technical overview of Tempered Glass, a material known for its strength
  and durability, for laser cleaning. Tempered Glass, when subjected to laser cleaning
  processes, benefits from the non-contact nature of the treatment, which preserves
  the glass's structural integrity while efficiently removing contaminants. The use
  of specific laser parameters, such as a wavelength of 1064nm and a fluence range
  of 0.5–5 J/cm², ensures optimal cleaning without compromising the tempered properties
  of the glass.
