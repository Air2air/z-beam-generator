    description: Compressive strength of plaster in masonry applications represents the maximum axial stress the material
      can withstand before failure under compression. This property is highly dependent on plaster composition, water-to-binder
      ratio, curing conditions, and age. Gypsum-based plasters typically exhibit lower strengths (2-20 MPa) while cement-lime
      plasters used in masonry achieve higher values due to hydraulic setting reactions and improved particle packing.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated plaster surface reveals a complex, stratified layer of foreign material.
    A discontinuous soot and particulate crust, measuring 5-20 micrometers thick, adheres to the surface. This crust obscures
    the underlying plaster texture and fills the material''s natural pores, which account for its 35% porosity.


    Beneath this crust, finer particulate matter has penetrated deep into the porous matrix. The original plaster surface
    is no longer distinct, as the contamination forms a cohesive, dark layer that bridges across the microscopic peaks and
    valleys of the substrate. The overall appearance is one of a occluded, topographically muted surface where the inherent
    granular structure of the plaster is largely hidden by the accumulated deposits.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the microscopic view at 500x magnification shows a complete transformation. The obscuring
    crust and embedded particulates have been entirely removed, revealing the pristine, granular microstructure of the plaster
    substrate. The surface''s intrinsic porosity is now fully exposed and unobstructed.


    The cleaning process has successfully ablated the contamination layer without damaging the underlying material. The original
    surface topography, with its characteristic peaks and valleys, is clearly visible. This confirms the selective nature
    of the laser ablation, which targeted the contaminant''s lower ablation threshold while preserving the plaster''s structural
    integrity.'
