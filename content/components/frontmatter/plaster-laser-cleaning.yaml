caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the plaster surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter (e.g., soot, dust) embedded in a matrix of organic films, such as lipids or hydrocarbons. The underlying plaster's micro-porous structure is filled, and its natural crystalline texture is masked. The contaminants form a continuous, obscuring film that alters the surface's original reflectance and topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning selectively removes the contamination layer, revealing the original plaster substrate. The micro-porous network, with pore sizes ranging from 5-50 µm, is now fully exposed and free of foreign material. The intrinsic crystalline structure of the calcium sulfate dihydrate is visible, restoring the surface's natural micro-roughness and light reflectance profile. No mechanical abrasion or residue from the cleaning process is detectable, confirming the non-contact precision of the method.
