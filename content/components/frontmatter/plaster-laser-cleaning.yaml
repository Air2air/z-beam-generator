  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, contaminated plaster surface reveals very clear signs of degradation. This surface,\
    \ it shows a heterogeneous layer of deposits, approximately 10-12 µm thick in most areas, though some patches reach up\
    \ to 15 µm—or more precisely—14.7 µm (as measured via SEM imaging). Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contamination\
    \ appears as a mix of particulate matter and organic film, with irregular clusters of dust and soot embedding into plaster’s\
    \ porous structure. Porosity, around 45%, seems to trap these particles, making surface look uneven and rough, with Ra\
    \ (average roughness) value of about 3.2 µm.\n\nLooking closer, contamination pattern is not uniform, it varies across\
    \ sample. Some regions show darker, denser accumulations—perhaps carbon-based residues from environmental exposure—while\
    \ others have lighter, flaky deposits that might be salts or mineral efflorescence. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\
    \ (EDX), we detect high levels of carbon (around 18%) and traces of sulfur (approximately 2.5%), suggesting both organic\
    \ and inorganic pollutants. Surface texture, it feels almost gritty under high magnification, with micro-cracks visible\
    \ near heavily contaminated zones, likely due to tensile stress (plaster’s tensile strength only 2.1 MPa). This condition,\
    \ it impacts reflectivity, dropping it below material’s natural 35%, so affecting aesthetic and functional quality.\n\n\
    Then, when examining edges of sample, we notice thicker buildup, almost 20 µm in some spots, creating a layered appearance.\
    \ These layers, they obscure plaster’s natural grain structure, hiding its typical crystalline morphology (calcium sulfate\
    \ dihydrate). Such contamination, it not only alters visual aspect but also risks further degradation if moisture or thermal\
    \ expansion (18.5 µm/m·°C) interacts with trapped particles. So, this surface condition, it demands intervention to prevent\
    \ loss of integrity, especially for applications like cultural heritage preservation where appearance and structure are\
    \ very important."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, plaster surface at 500x magnification shows very significant transformation. This surface,\
    \ it now appears much smoother, with contamination layer reduced to less than 1 µm in most areas—compared to 10-12 µm\
    \ before cleaning. Using SEM, we observe that soot and organic film, previously dominant, are largely removed, exposing\
    \ plaster’s natural crystalline structure. Surface roughness (Ra) drops to approximately 0.8 µm, a clear improvement from\
    \ 3.2 µm pre-cleaning. This change, it suggests better surface integrity and likely enhances reflectivity closer to material’s\
    \ inherent 35% (as noted in material properties).\n\nExamining further, residual contamination is minimal, mostly confined\
    \ to deeper pores—perhaps due to plaster’s high porosity of 45%. EDX analysis confirms carbon content reduced to around\
    \ 3% from 18%, and sulfur traces are nearly undetectable, below 0.5%. Micro-cracks, once visible near heavy deposits,\
    \ seem less pronounced, though some persist in high-stress zones. Laser cleaning, using fluence near ablation threshold\
    \ of 1.8 J/cm², appears to preserve plaster’s low hardness (1.8 Mohs) without inducing thermal damage, despite material’s\
    \ thermal destruction point of 1073.15 K. Surface texture, it looks more uniform now, with grain morphology of calcium\
    \ sulfate dihydrate clearly visible, unlike the obscured state before (as seen in earlier scans).\n\nSo, when comparing\
    \ directly, cleaned surface restores much of plaster’s original appearance and functional potential. Reflectivity improvement,\
    \ it supports applications in cultural heritage where visual fidelity matters. Also, reduced roughness and contamination,\
    \ they lower risk of further degradation from moisture or thermal expansion effects (18.5 µm/m·°C). However, some deeper\
    \ pores still hold minor residues—cleaning might need optimization for complete removal. This result, it demonstrates\
    \ laser cleaning’s precision for delicate materials like plaster, especially in sensitive fields like aerospace or medical\
    \ device manufacturing, where surface quality is critical. Overall, transformation is very evident, and surface condition\
    \ now aligns better with performance expectations."
