        research_basis: Plaster (primarily gypsum-based) has very poor corrosion resistance
          as it is highly soluble in water and readily deteriorates in moist or humid
          environments. ASTM standards classify gypsum plasters as unsuitable for
          exterior or wet service conditions due to their susceptibility to water
          damage and lack of chemical stability when exposed to moisture, which is
          the primary driver of general environmental corrosion.

        source: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), "Thermal Properties
          of Gypsum Plaster" (Monograph 158)
        research_basis: Plaster (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) decomposes to anhydrite
          (CaSO₄) around 1200°C in air, where significant oxidation-driven structural
          breakdown occurs. NIST data confirms this as the maximum service temperature
          before rapid degradation, though practical limits are lower (~600°C) due
          to dehydration phases.

          typical material property data sheets for gypsum plaster from construction
          material databases.
        research_basis: For brittle, cementitious materials like plaster, a well-established
          empirical relationship exists where the flexural strength is typically 20-30%
          of the compressive strength. Given the provided compressive strength of
          12.4 MPa, this predicts a flexural strength of approximately 2.5 - 3.7 MPa.
          Independent data sheets for gypsum plaster consistently report 3-point bend
          test results in the range of 2.8 to 3.4 MPa, with 3.1 MPa being a representative
          median value for a plaster of this density and compressive strength.

          The provided compressive strength (12.4 MPa) and low Mohs hardness are consistent

          (Ashby, CES EduPack) list the fracture toughness (K_IC) for gypsum and plasters
          within a range of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 MPa·√m. The cited value of 0.15
          MPa·√m is a representative median for this class of material, aligning with
          its low mechanical properties.
