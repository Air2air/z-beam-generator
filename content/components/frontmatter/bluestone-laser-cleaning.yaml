caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the bluestone surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, including soot and minerals, is embedded
    within the stone''s 8.5% porosity. A continuous biofilm, 10-50 micrometers thick,
    adheres to the quartz grains, creating a dark, cohesive crust that masks the substrate''s
    natural texture and color. This layer exhibits poor adhesion to the underlying
    stone, creating micro-fractures at the interface.


    The contaminants fill the intergranular spaces, forming an irregular topography
    that disrupts the stone''s inherent morphology. The surface appears amorphous,
    with the stone''s crystalline structure and granular boundaries completely concealed.
    This layer alters the surface''s thermal and optical properties, increasing its
    absorption of environmental pollutants and moisture.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the restoration
    of the bluestone''s intrinsic mineralogy. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via ablation, exposing the interlocking quartz grains with a hardness
    of 6.5 Mohs. The surface now displays sharp granular boundaries and a clean, micro-rough
    texture characteristic of the original sandstone, with a porosity of 8.5% clearly
    visible.


    The process has selectively eliminated the foreign crust without damaging the
    substrate, as confirmed by the intact feldspar grains and cementing matrix. The
    stone''s natural color and reflective properties, with a reflectivity of 0.25
    at 1064 nm, are restored. The surface is free of residual contamination, presenting
    a coherent and stable mineral structure.'
