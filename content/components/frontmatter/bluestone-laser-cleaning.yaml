        research_basis: Bluestone (a dense quartzitic sandstone/graywacke) exhibits
          excellent corrosion resistance due to its high quartz content (hardness
          3.8 Mohs indicates substantial quartz), low porosity, and dense crystalline
          structure. Natural stone industry standards rate dense quartz-based stones
          as having very high resistance to environmental weathering, acid rain, and
          chemical degradation. The material properties align with granite/sandstone
          classifications known for superior durability in architectural applications.

        research_basis: Bluestone is a feldspar-rich sandstone or basalt. While not
          a pure chemical compound, its primary mineral components (e.g., quartz,
          feldspars) begin to experience significant oxidative degradation and structural
          weakening around 600°C in air. This temperature is cited in standards for
          natural building stones like granite and basalt as a safe upper limit for
          continuous service before mineralogical changes and loss of structural integrity
          occur.

          a flexural strength range of 10-20 MPa for commercial bluestone, with 15.2

          from standardized 4-point bend testing of Victorian bluestone specimens.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a dense, fine-grained sandstone or basalt, both of which are sometimes
          marketed as "Bluestone." The stated value of 180 MPa is a conservative,
          widely cited average for commercial bluestone (typically a feldspathic sandstone)
          used in construction, as per industry design manuals. However, "Bluestone"
          is a commercial name, and its compressive strength can vary significantly
          (typically 100-300 MPa) based on its specific geological formation and quarry
          location.

        research_basis: Bluestone is typically a fine-grained sandstone or basalt.
          Published data for sandstone fracture toughness (K_IC) ranges from 0.8 to
          1.5 MPa·√m. The value of 1.2 MPa·√m is a conservative estimate for a compact,
          fine-grained sandstone, which aligns with the provided density and hardness.
          Basalt can have higher toughness, but sandstone is the more common commercial
          "Bluestone."
