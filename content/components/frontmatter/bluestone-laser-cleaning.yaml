caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bluestone surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    particulate matter (soot, dust) embedded in a matrix of organic and inorganic
    deposits, such as gypsum crusts from atmospheric sulfur. The underlying quartz
    and feldspar grains of the stone are partially masked. The contaminant morphology
    is irregular, creating a porous, textured surface that traps further particulate
    and promotes moisture retention, accelerating material decay.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the stratified contamination layer,
    revealing the original mineralogical substrate. The surface now exhibits the distinct,
    interlocking crystals of quartz and feldspar, with grain boundaries clearly defined.
    The stone's intrinsic micro-roughness and porosity are restored, eliminating the
    obscuring crust and reducing potential sites for future biological colonization.

subtitle: Handling Bluestone in laser operations often reveals its subtle variations
  in texture, which can catch you off guard if you’re not attentive. Adjust the power
  levels gradually below 50 watts to protect its delicate, natural finish.
