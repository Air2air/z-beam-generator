caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the bluestone surface is obscured by a continuous, amorphous contamination layer approximately
    15-25 micrometers thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous deposits and embedded particulate from industrial processes,
    completely masks the stone''s inherent crystalline microstructure. The surface texture appears matte and uneven, with
    fissures and voids that trap additional contaminants, reducing the material''s natural reflectivity.


    The contamination adheres tenaciously to the substrate, filling the natural micro-pores of the stone (approximately 1-5
    µm in diameter). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) would likely identify high concentrations of carbon and sulfur,
    consistent with hydrocarbon-based residues. This layer compromises the surface''s functional integrity and alters its
    thermal and chemical properties.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying bluestone substrate.
    The surface now exhibits the distinct, interlocking crystalline structure of quartzite, with individual mineral grains
    clearly defined at their boundaries. The micro-topography shows natural cleavage planes and a return to the stone''s intrinsic
    surface roughness, free from any obscuring deposits.


    The removal process has successfully cleared the stone''s micro-porosity, with pores now open and visible. This restoration
    of the original surface geometry is critical for maintaining the material''s permeability and absorption characteristics.
    The reflectivity has increased measurably, consistent with the exposure of the pristine mineral surface.


    Comparative analysis confirms the ablation process selectively targeted the contaminant layer, which has a lower vaporization
    threshold than the bluestone''s primary quartz minerals. The substrate shows no evidence of thermal damage, such as melting
    or micro-fracturing, indicating the laser parameters were precisely controlled to remain below the stone''s ablation threshold
    of approximately 2.5 J/cm². The surface integrity is fully preserved.'
