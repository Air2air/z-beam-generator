description: Quartzite, primarily composed of SiO2, offers exceptional durability
  and resistance to weathering, making it an ideal candidate for laser cleaning applications.
  The precision of laser technology allows for the effective removal of contaminants
  while preserving the structural integrity and aesthetic qualities of the quartzite
  surfaces. This method is particularly advantageous for cleaning quartzite in both
  construction and restoration contexts, where maintaining the original material's
  appearance is crucial.
