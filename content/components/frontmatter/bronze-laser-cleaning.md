chemicalProperties:
  formula: Cu-Sn
  materialType: metal
  symbol: Cu-Sn
compatibility:
- Stainless steel fixtures (for mounting bronze components during processing)
- Aluminum shielding (for laser safety enclosures and fume extraction systems)
complexity: medium
composition:
- Typically 88% Cu, 12% Sn
description: Laser cleaning of bronze (Cu-Sn alloy) utilizes precise pulsed laser ablation to remove surface oxides, corrosion, and contaminants while preserving the base metal. The process exploits the differential absorption of laser energy between the contamination layer and the bronze substrate, with optimal parameters carefully selected to avoid melting or microstructural changes in the alloy.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical waste generation
  description: Eliminates use of hazardous chemical cleaners (acids, solvents) and associated disposal requirements, reducing environmental contamination risk by 100% compared to traditional methods
- benefit: Reduced energy consumption
  description: Laser cleaning consumes approximately 60-70% less energy than abrasive blasting or chemical cleaning processes for equivalent surface area treatment
