description: Bronze, primarily composed of copper (Cu) and tin (Sn), is a robust alloy
  widely used in both manufacturing and restoration. Its properties, such as corrosion
  resistance and durability, make it ideal for applications requiring longevity. Laser
  cleaning, particularly at a wavelength of 1064nm, effectively removes contaminants
  from bronze surfaces without damaging the underlying material, ensuring preservation
  and restoration of bronze artifacts and industrial parts.
