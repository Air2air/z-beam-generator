description: Technical overview of Steel, Fe-C, for laser cleaning. Steel, represented
  by the chemical formula Fe-C, is a versatile alloy widely used in industrial applications.
  Its response to laser cleaning, particularly at a wavelength of 1064nm, makes it
  suitable for precise removal of surface contaminants without compromising the material's
  integrity. This process leverages the thermal and mechanical properties of steel
  to ensure effective cleaning and surface preparation.
