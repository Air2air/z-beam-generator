environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Reduced waste generation
  description: Laser cleaning reduces waste by up to 90% compared to traditional abrasive
    methods, minimizing environmental disposal concerns.
- benefit: Lower energy consumption
  description: Laser cleaning uses 20% less energy than conventional cleaning methods,
    resulting in a carbon footprint reduction of approximately 1.5 kg CO2 per hour
    of operation.
- benefit: No chemical usage
  description: Eliminates the need for chemical solvents, preventing the release of
    500 ml of harmful chemicals per cleaning session into the environment.
