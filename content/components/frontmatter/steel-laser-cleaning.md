description: Steel, known chemically as Fe-C, is a versatile alloy widely used in
  various industries due to its strength and durability. Laser cleaning of steel involves
  the use of high-intensity laser beams to remove contaminants like rust, paint, oil,
  and oxides from the surface. This non-contact method ensures minimal damage to the
  steel's microstructure, making it ideal for applications where surface integrity
  is crucial. The process leverages the material properties of steel, such as its
  high melting point and thermal conductivity, to efficiently ablate unwanted layers
  without compromising the underlying steel.
