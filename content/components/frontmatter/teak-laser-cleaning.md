description: Technical overview of Teak for laser cleaning, highlighting its natural
  resistance to environmental stressors and the suitability for laser ablation due
  to its stable chemical composition. Teak's dense and oily nature requires precise
  laser parameters to ensure effective cleaning without damaging the wood's integrity.
