description: Technical overview of Stainless Steel, Fe-Cr-Ni, for laser cleaning.
  Stainless Steel, primarily composed of iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni),
  is highly valued in industries like automotive and aerospace for its robust corrosion
  resistance and strength. Laser cleaning of stainless steel involves the precise
  removal of surface contaminants such as rust, oil, and paint through the use of
  high-energy laser pulses at a wavelength of 1064nm. This non-contact cleaning method
  maintains the integrity of the material, preserving its microstructure and mechanical
  properties, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring high precision
  and minimal material alteration.
