caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 2-5 micrometers
    in thickness. This layer consists of accumulated carbonaceous deposits, particulate matter, and adsorbed organic films.
    The underlying metal's characteristic fine grain structure is entirely masked. The contaminants exhibit a mottled, textured
    pattern, creating a topographically complex and optically diffuse surface that scatters light and significantly reduces
    reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate, revealing the intrinsic, fine-grained microstructure of the
    rhodium. The surface is now continuous and uniform, with contamination completely absent. This results in a microscopically
    smooth finish that maximizes the metal's inherent high reflectivity and surface integrity.
