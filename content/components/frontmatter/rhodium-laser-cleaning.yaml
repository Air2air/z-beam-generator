caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, adsorbed hydrocarbons, and localized oxide spots, creating a topographically
    complex and irregular surface. The underlying metallic substrate is partially
    visible, but its high reflectivity is significantly attenuated. The contamination
    disrupts the native crystalline structure, forming a discontinuous film that adheres
    to grain boundaries and surface defects, resulting in a matte, diffuse appearance
    with low visual contrast.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the substrate to its intrinsic state. At 500x,
    the surface now exhibits a continuous, specularly reflective plane with clearly
    defined grain boundaries. The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing
    the pristine, face-centered cubic crystalline structure of the rhodium. Surface
    roughness is minimized, and the material's characteristic 78% reflectivity at
    1064 nm is fully recovered, resulting in a microscopically smooth and metallurgically
    clean finish.
