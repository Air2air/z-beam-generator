caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated rhodium surface shows a non-uniform layer of carbonaceous deposits
    and oxide particles approximately 2-5 micrometers thick. This contamination layer appears as dark, irregular patches that
    obscure the underlying metal''s grain structure and create a textured, matte surface finish. The deposits follow a dendritic
    pattern, suggesting thermal degradation or oxidation has occurred across specific crystalline boundaries.


    The surface exhibits significant topographical variation with visible pitting and particulate adhesion. Foreign particles,
    ranging from 1-10 micrometers in diameter, are embedded within the contamination matrix. These features scatter light
    effectively, accounting for the surface''s dull appearance and reduced reflectivity compared to pure rhodium.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the rhodium surface at 500x magnification reveals complete removal of the contamination
    layer, exposing the underlying FCC crystalline grain structure. The previously obscured metal surface now displays characteristic
    polishing lines and uniform grain boundaries, with particulate contamination reduced to sub-micrometer levels. The transformation
    from a matte, textured appearance to a smooth, reflective surface is evident.


    The laser process has restored the metal''s inherent reflectivity without introducing significant surface damage. Minor,
    shallow micro-craters approximately 0.5-2 micrometers in diameter are visible where intense contamination was selectively
    ablated. The cleaned surface maintains rhodium''s structural integrity while achieving a contamination-free state suitable
    for high-performance applications.'
