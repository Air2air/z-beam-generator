caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, particulate matter, and localized oxide films, which form irregular,
    dendritic patterns across the substrate. The underlying metal's characteristic
    FCC grain structure is entirely masked. The contamination creates a matte, topographically
    complex surface that significantly increases light scattering and reduces the
    intrinsic 78% reflectivity of the pure metal.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, fine-grained microstructure
    of the rhodium substrate. Contaminant layers have been completely removed via
    selective laser ablation, restoring a continuous, specular surface. The metal's
    high reflectivity and smooth topography are now evident, with clearly defined
    grain boundaries and no measurable thermal damage to the underlying structure.

subtitle: Rhodium’s high reflectivity often throws off laser alignment during treatment.
  Adjust your controls to below 50 watts initially, then ramp up slowly to protect
  the metal’s delicate finish from unintended heat buildup.
