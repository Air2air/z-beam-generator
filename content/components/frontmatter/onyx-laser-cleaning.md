description: Technical overview of Onyx, a unique stone material, for laser cleaning.
  Onyx, composed primarily of silica, is valued for its aesthetic and structural properties
  in both jewelry and construction. Laser cleaning with a wavelength of 1064nm and
  pulse durations between 5-50ns ensures effective removal of surface contaminants
  without compromising the material's integrity. This process is particularly beneficial
  for restoring the luster and structural integrity of onyx, making it ideal for high-quality
  applications.
