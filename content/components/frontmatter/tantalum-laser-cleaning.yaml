caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous particulates and discontinuous oxide scales, creating a topographically
    complex and rough texture. The underlying metal's grain structure is entirely masked. The contaminants form irregular,
    splotchy patterns, significantly increasing surface roughness and compromising the material's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation. The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing
    the pristine, fine-grained metallic structure of the tantalum substrate. The surface is now uniform and smooth, with a
    consistent, clean metallic luster and sharply defined grain boundaries, restoring the material's native surface characteristics.
