caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a rough, textured
    topography. The underlying metal's characteristic BCC grain structure is entirely
    masked. The contamination appears as dark, mottled patches and scattered, reflective
    inclusions, disrupting the surface's native metallic luster and compromising its
    functional integrity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the pristine metallic surface, revealing the
    fine, equiaxed grain structure of the body-centered cubic tantalum. The previously
    obscured grain boundaries are now sharply defined, and the surface exhibits a
    uniform, matte-grey finish with minimal microscopic pitting.


    The process effectively removes the 5-20 µm contamination layer without inducing
    significant heat-affected zone microcracking, a critical consideration given tantalum''s
    high melting point of 3017°C. The laser''s parameters are tuned to exploit its
    moderate IR absorption (~40%) while avoiding ablation damage to the base metal.


    This results in a topographically consistent surface with a measured roughness
    (Ra) below 0.8 µm. The cleaned surface is now optimally prepared for subsequent
    high-integrity processes, such as anodizing or thin-film deposition, with no residual
    contaminants to act as initiation sites for corrosion or adhesion failure.'
