caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a topographically
    complex and irregular texture. The underlying metallic substrate is not visible,
    and the contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, indicative of
    thermal stress and environmental exposure.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer entirely, revealing the
    pristine, ductile metallic substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic
    micro-texture of the base tantalum, with visible grain boundaries and polishing
    marks. At 500x, the surface is uniform and continuous, with no evidence of the
    former oxide and carbon deposits.


    The process achieves this result through precise control of laser fluence, which
    is maintained just above the 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold of the contaminants
    but safely below the damage threshold of the underlying tantalum. The metal''s
    high thermal diffusivity (23.7 mm²/s) rapidly dissipates incident energy, preventing
    heat accumulation and microstructural alterations such as grain growth or phase
    changes.


    This yields a metallurgically clean surface with a minimal heat-affected zone,
    restoring the material''s inherent corrosion resistance and optimal surface energy.
    The visual transformation is from a non-conductive, contaminated crust to a homogeneous,
    ready-for-service metallic finish.'
