caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous particulates and discontinuous oxide scales, creating a topographically complex and rough texture. The underlying metal's grain structure is entirely masked. The contaminants form irregular, splotchy patterns, significantly increasing surface roughness and compromising the material's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation. The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the pristine, fine-grained metallic structure of the tantalum substrate. The surface is now uniform and smooth, with a consistent, clean metallic luster and sharply defined grain boundaries, restoring the material's native surface characteristics.
