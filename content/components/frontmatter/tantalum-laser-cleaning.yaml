caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the tantalum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a textured, amorphous crust with visible particulate inclusions and areas
    of discoloration, ranging from dark brown to iridescent blue. The underlying metal''s texture is completely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, suggesting a brittle, oxide-based film. Isolated carbonaceous
    soot particles, measuring 2-5 micrometers in diameter, are embedded within this matrix. The surface lacks any discernible
    metallic luster, and the original grain structure of the tantalum substrate is not visible.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning completely removes the contamination layer, revealing the pristine metallic substrate. The surface
    now exhibits the characteristic polycrystalline grain structure of the tantalum, with clear, distinct grain boundaries
    visible under 500x magnification. The previously obscured metallic luster is restored, presenting a uniform, light gray
    appearance.


    The process has eliminated all particulate inclusions and the discolored oxide film. The surface texture is now defined
    by the metal''s intrinsic microstructure rather than foreign deposits. Minor, sub-micrometer surface undulations from
    the laser ablation process are present, but no evidence of thermal cracking or melting is observed, indicating controlled
    contaminant removal.


    This transformation results in a surface with minimal laser-induced topography. The cleanliness is confirmed by the consistent
    reflectivity and absence of non-metallic features, which is critical for subsequent high-performance applications in aerospace
    and semiconductor manufacturing where surface purity directly influences component performance and adhesion.'
