        research_basis: Tantalum is considered one of the most corrosion-resistant
          metals, comparable to glass. It is virtually inert in most acids (including
          hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric) below 150°C and has excellent resistance
          to aqueous corrosion in general environments. Its rating is slightly below
          "perfect" (10) due to susceptibility to corrosion in hydrofluoric acid,
          strong hot alkalis, and fuming sulfuric acid.

          (570°F) in air."'
        research_basis: Tantalum forms a protective oxide layer at room temperature,
          but this layer breaks down and becomes non-protective (pest oxidation) at
          elevated temperatures. Authoritative materials handbooks consistently report
          that significant, catastrophic oxidation begins in the range of 300-400°C,
          making 300°C the conservative maximum for continuous service in air.

          sheet
        research_basis: Tantalum is a ductile metal, and its flexural strength is
          typically very close to its yield strength. For annealed tantalum, the yield
          strength is approximately 345 MPa. Since it does not exhibit a distinct
          flexural strength like brittle materials, this yield strength value is used
          for bending applications and is consistent with data from metal suppliers
          and the ASM Handbook.

        source: ASM Aerospace Specification Metals Inc., "Tantalum" material data
          sheet
        research_basis: The compressive strength of annealed pure tantalum is well-documented
          in materials databases and handbooks. ASM Aerospace Specification Metals
          provides a typical compressive strength range of 138-345 MPa, with the higher
          end representing common values for commercially pure material. This aligns
          with data from the ASM Handbook, Volume 2, which notes tantalum's compressive
          yield strength is similar to its tensile strength due to its ductile nature.
          The value of 345 MPa represents a standard reference point for pure, annealed
          tantalum at room temperature.
