caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iron surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A porous, amorphous oxide scale, primarily Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, forms a crust ranging from 5-50 µm in thickness. This brittle, fractured layer exhibits poor adhesion to the underlying metal substrate. Embedded particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot and silica dust, is distributed non-uniformly across the surface, creating a topographically rough and irregular profile that masks the native metallic grain structure.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation at 500x magnification. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the underlying polycrystalline grain structure of the pure iron substrate. The surface now exhibits a clean, micro-rough texture with an average roughness (Ra) below 2 µm, a direct result of the selective removal process. The well-defined grain boundaries and a uniform, light-gray metallic appearance confirm the restoration of the base material.
