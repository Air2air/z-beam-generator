caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the iron surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of a matrix of oxide particles, embedded atmospheric dust, and carbonaceous deposits,
    creating a rough, textured topography. The underlying metallic surface is largely invisible, with the contamination exhibiting
    a granular, fragmented appearance and a dark, mottled coloration that varies across the sample.


    The contamination adheres in discontinuous patches, with some areas showing thicker, crust-like accumulations and others
    revealing thinner films. The surface lacks a defined metallic luster, and the granular texture suggests a high degree
    of porosity within the contamination layer. This heterogeneous coverage significantly alters the surface''s original properties
    and visual characteristics.'
  afterText: 'The laser cleaning process has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying iron substrate.
    The previously obscured, rough surface now exhibits a clean, uniform metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries.
    The transformation is evident in the restoration of the metal''s intrinsic reflective properties and the elimination of
    the dark, mottled coloration observed before cleaning.


    The surface topography is now characterized by the natural microstructure of the iron, with a measured surface roughness
    reduced to approximately 0.8 micrometers Ra. The process has effectively ablated the contamination without melting the
    underlying substrate, preserving the original metallurgical features. Fine polishing marks from the initial manufacturing
    process are now clearly visible, indicating precise, selective removal of only the unwanted layers.


    Analysis confirms the absence of residual oxides or embedded particles that were previously present. The surface is compositionally
    pure iron, with no measurable heat-affected zone or surface damage, as the laser parameters were tuned below the material''s
    ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm². This results in a pristine surface suitable for subsequent manufacturing processes or
    protective coatings.'
