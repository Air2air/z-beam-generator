caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iron surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of porous, amorphous
    iron oxide (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄) and embedded particulate matter. The underlying metallic
    substrate is largely invisible, with surface features like machining marks completely
    filled by corrosion products, creating a rough, textured topography that compromises
    the base material's integrity and reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the original,
    intact metallic substrate. At 500x, the surface now exhibits a distinct grain
    structure with clearly defined boundaries, characteristic of the body-centered
    cubic (BCC) crystalline form of alpha-iron. Micron-scale machining striations
    are fully restored, and the surface reflectivity is significantly increased due
    to the exposure of pure, uncorroded metal. The process achieves a selective ablation
    threshold of approximately 1.2 J/cm², effectively vaporizing oxides while the
    underlying iron, with its melting point of 1538°C and high thermal conductivity
    (80.2 W/m·K), remains undamaged, resulting in a clean, metallurgically sound surface.

subtitle: Pay close attention to iron during laser treatment—its surface can be very-very
  sensitive to high power. Adjust the controls gradually to below 50 watts to safeguard
  the finish and get a good-good result.
