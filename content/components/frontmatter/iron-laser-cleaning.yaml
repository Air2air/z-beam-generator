caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iron surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-50 µm thick. This layer consists of adherent
    oxides (rust), carbonaceous soot, and embedded particulate matter. The underlying
    metallic substrate is largely invisible, with the texture dominated by the porous,
    irregular topography of the corrosion products and foreign deposits, which create
    a matte, non-reflective surface.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned surface reveals the intact, original metallic substrate
    with a distinct micro-texture. The contamination layer is entirely removed, exposing
    the iron's grain structure and minor manufacturing marks. This results in a specular,
    reflective finish with no measurable substrate damage, restoring the material's
    inherent surface properties.
