subtitle: Iron is highly prone to oxidation, forming tenacious rust layers unlike
  other ferrous metals. This requires careful adjustment of laser parameters to effectively
  remove corrosion without damaging the underlying base metal.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iron surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A porous, amorphous oxide scale, primarily Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, forms a crust
    ranging from 5-50 µm in thickness. This brittle, fractured layer exhibits poor
    adhesion to the underlying metal substrate. Embedded particulate matter, including
    carbonaceous soot and silica dust, is distributed non-uniformly across the surface,
    creating a topographically rough and irregular profile that masks the native metallic
    grain structure.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation
    at 500x magnification. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing
    the underlying polycrystalline grain structure of the pure iron substrate. The
    surface now exhibits a clean, micro-rough texture with an average roughness (Ra)
    below 2 µm, a direct result of the selective removal process. The well-defined
    grain boundaries and a uniform, light-gray metallic appearance confirm the restoration
    of the base material.
