description: Technical overview of Bamboo for laser cleaning. Bamboo, a versatile
  and sustainable wood, is ideal for laser cleaning due to its unique cellular structure
  and low thermal conductivity. Laser cleaning of bamboo surfaces using 1064nm wavelength
  and controlled energy density between 0.5-3.0 J/cm² effectively removes contaminants
  like mold and mildew without compromising the integrity of the material. This non-contact
  method is particularly valuable in conservation efforts for cleaning bamboo artifacts.
