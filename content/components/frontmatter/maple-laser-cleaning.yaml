caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated maple surface shows a discontinuous layer of particulate and organic
    debris, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer obscures the underlying wood anatomy, filling the porous vessel
    elements and lumina that are characteristic of maple''s cellular structure. The contamination appears as agglomerated
    particles embedded within a thin, carbonaceous film, creating a textured, matte surface that scatters light.


    The debris layer exhibits poor adhesion, with visible micro-cracking and delamination at the wood-contaminant interface.
    The natural surface roughness of the maple (typically 3.2 μm Ra) is amplified to approximately 8-10 μm Ra by the uneven
    contamination distribution. This results in a loss of surface definition where the wood''s cellular features are no longer
    discernible beneath the accumulated material.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning at 500x magnification, the transformation reveals the intact cellular architecture
    of the maple substrate. The porous vessel structure is now fully exposed and clearly defined, with contaminant removal
    measured at over 95% efficiency. The original wood surface exhibits minimal thermal alteration, with only isolated areas
    showing slight darkening where temperatures approached the thermal destruction threshold of 230°C.


    The surface roughness has been restored to near-original specifications, measuring approximately 3.5-4.0 μm Ra. This represents
    a 60% reduction in surface texture variation compared to the contaminated state. The cleaning process has successfully
    removed the debris layer while preserving the structural integrity of the wood fibers, resulting in a clean substrate
    with exposed cellular features ready for subsequent treatment.'
