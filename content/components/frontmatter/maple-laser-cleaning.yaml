caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the maple surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded soot, dried oils, and microbial biofilms, fills the natural wood pores and masks the underlying cellular structure. The surface texture is irregular and matte, with contamination adhering strongly to the porous, fibrous network of the maple, significantly increasing its visual surface roughness.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively restored the native maple substrate. The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the clean, open vessels and distinct ray cells of the wood's anatomy. The surface now exhibits the original, characteristic grain pattern with a texture measuring approximately 3.2 µm Ra. The process has achieved selective ablation of contaminants without carbonizing the underlying cellulose-lignin matrix, resulting in a pristine, well-defined microscopic surface.
