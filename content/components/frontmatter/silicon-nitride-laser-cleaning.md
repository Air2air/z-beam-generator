description: Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) is a high-performance ceramic material known
  for its excellent thermal shock resistance and mechanical strength. In laser cleaning
  applications, Si3N4's low thermal expansion and high hardness make it an ideal candidate
  for precise and non-contact surface treatment. The material's robust nature allows
  it to withstand the high-intensity pulses of laser ablation, ensuring effective
  removal of contaminants without damaging the underlying structure. This makes Silicon
  Nitride particularly suitable for applications in semiconductors and automotive
  industries where surface integrity is critical.
