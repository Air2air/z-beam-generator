description: Technical overview of Stucco, a masonry material, for laser cleaning.
  Stucco, composed primarily of cement, sand, and lime, is processed using laser ablation
  techniques for effective cleaning and restoration. The laser's non-contact nature
  ensures minimal damage to the underlying stucco, maintaining structural integrity
  while removing contaminants such as dirt, mold, and old coatings. The process is
  particularly advantageous in preserving historical and architectural details in
  stucco facades, allowing for precise control over surface treatment depth and area.
