caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the shale surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres to the
    substrate. This layer is a composite of particulate matter, such as soot and dust,
    cemented by organic exudates and sulfate salts. The underlying shale texture is
    largely hidden, with only the most prominent mineral grains creating topographical
    relief through the crust. The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern,
    indicating desiccation and poor adhesion to the stone's intrinsic porosity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete transformation.
    The obscuring contamination crust has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine,
    mineralogically diverse shale substrate. The surface now displays a well-defined
    granular texture, with individual clay particles and sharp-edged quartz grains
    clearly resolved. The natural porosity, appearing as sub-micron pits and intergranular
    voids, is fully opened and free of occluding material. The cleaning process has
    restored the original surface morphology without inducing thermal cracking or
    melting, preserving the stone's structural integrity.

subtitle: Operators have learned that shale performs best when you start with minimal
  power, around 10 watts. Push too hard initially, and its varied sedimentary layers
  might crack under uneven thermal stress during treatment.
