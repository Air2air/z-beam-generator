caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the shale surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, such as soot and dust, embedded within a matrix of organic and inorganic
    deposits like salts and oxidized pollutants. The contaminants fill the natural
    micro-fissures and pores of the shale, creating a discontinuous, crust-like texture
    that masks the underlying mineralogical features. This crust exhibits poor adhesion
    to the substrate, with visible delamination at the interface, indicating a weak
    boundary prone to selective removal.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination crust, fully
    revealing the pristine shale substrate. The surface now displays the material's
    intrinsic micro-texture, with clearly defined grain boundaries and open porosity.
    All foreign deposits have been eliminated without mechanical alteration to the
    underlying stone.
