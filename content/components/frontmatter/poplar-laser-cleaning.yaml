caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the poplar surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous contamination layer approximately
    15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded soot, dust, and organic residues, fills the wood's porous structure,
    masking the characteristic cellular anatomy. The surface texture is irregular and crust-like, with no visible wood grain
    or cell wall definition, indicating significant particulate accumulation within the lumen of the vessels and fibers.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing the intact, underlying wood microstructure.
    The porous network of vessels and fibers is now fully exposed, with cell walls appearing sharp and well-defined. The original
    surface texture is restored, showing the natural grain pattern and anatomical features without the masking crust.


    The process achieves selective ablation, vaporizing contaminants at 380°C while the poplar substrate, with its low thermal
    conductivity of 0.12 W/m·K, remains largely unaffected. This precision prevents collateral thermal damage, preserving
    the structural integrity of the delicate cell walls. The result is a topographically clean surface with restored porosity
    and minimal residue, ready for further conservation or finishing steps.'
