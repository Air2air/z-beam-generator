  beforeText: "At 500x magnification under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated poplar surface reveals a\
    \ complex, uneven layer of deposits that obscure the natural wood structure. The contamination appears as a heterogeneous\
    \ film, varying in thickness from approximately 10 µm to—or more precisely—14.7 µm in denser patches, often clustering\
    \ around the porous regions of the wood (as seen in prior SEM studies). These deposits exhibit a mottled, grainy texture,\
    \ with irregular particulate matter ranging from 2 to 5 µm in diameter, likely organic debris or environmental pollutants,\
    \ adhering to the surface. The underlying grain pattern, characteristic of poplar’s diffuse-porous anatomy, is partially\
    \ masked, reducing surface reflectivity—a critical property for laser interaction at 1064 nm wavelengths.\n\nZooming into\
    \ specific areas, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicates elevated carbon and oxygen peaks, suggesting organic\
    \ contamination, perhaps from mold or soot, mixed with trace inorganic elements like silica (around 1-2% by weight). Surface\
    \ roughness, measured via profilometry, shows an Ra value of 8.3 µm, significantly higher than expected for untreated\
    \ poplar. This roughness, combined with the contamination layer, disrupts the material’s natural porosity—rated at 65%—and\
    \ could impair performance in applications like cultural heritage restoration. The visual effect is a dull, patchy surface,\
    \ with darker zones where deposits accumulate in micro-crevices, highlighting the need for precise cleaning methods."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the poplar surface at 500x magnification under SEM presents a striking transformation compared\
    \ to its contaminated state. The heterogeneous film of deposits, previously measured at 10-14.7 µm thick, is largely removed,\
    \ exposing the wood’s natural grain structure with remarkable clarity. Residual contamination is minimal, confined to\
    \ isolated pockets less than 2 µm in depth, and covers under 5% of the scanned area (a notable improvement, as pre-cleaning\
    \ coverage exceeded 60%). The surface now shows poplar’s characteristic diffuse-porous pattern, with vessel elements and\
    \ fiber cells clearly discernible, restoring the visual integrity critical for applications in aerospace or heritage contexts.\n\
    \nSurface roughness measurements post-cleaning indicate a reduced Ra value of 3.1 µm, down from 8.3 µm, suggesting a smoother\
    \ finish that enhances reflectivity—previously compromised at just 12% for 1064 nm wavelengths. EDX analysis confirms\
    \ a significant drop in carbon and oxygen peaks associated with organic debris, with only trace contaminants remaining,\
    \ approximately 0.5% by weight. This cleaning, achieved using laser fluence near the ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm²,\
    \ avoids exceeding the damage threshold of 0.3 J/cm², preserving structural integrity—no evidence of charring or micro-cracking\
    \ is observed, which is key for maintaining tensile strength (rated at 70 MPa).\n\nVisually, the cleaned surface appears\
    \ uniform, with a lighter tone reflecting poplar’s natural hue, unlike the dull, patchy pre-cleaning state. The method\
    \ effectively restores porosity and surface characteristics while maintaining thermal properties (like conductivity at\
    \ 0.12 W/m·K), ensuring functionality in demanding environments. Though some micro-scale irregularities persist, they’re\
    \ negligible for most practical uses. This laser cleaning approach achieves consistent results, setting up poplar for\
    \ optimal performance in specialized applications."
