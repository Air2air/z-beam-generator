caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated poplar surface is characterized by a discontinuous layer of particulate
    and biological matter, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer obscures the underlying wood anatomy, with foreign particles
    embedded in the porous structure. The contamination exhibits a granular texture, composed of fine soot and mineral dust
    agglomerates, which adhere to the wood''s cellular fibers.


    The natural open-cell structure of the poplar, with its typical porosity of 55%, is partially occluded by this debris.
    The surface appears uneven, with contamination accumulating preferentially within the lumens of vessels and fibers. This
    creates a mottled appearance that masks the wood''s inherent grain pattern and surface texture, which normally measures
    approximately 3.2 µm Ra for planed poplar.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals complete removal of the contamination layer, restoring
    the native wood surface. The open-cell microstructure is now fully exposed, with vessel elements and fiber cells clearly
    visible and free of embedded particulate matter. The cleaning process has successfully cleared the 55% porous network
    without depositing secondary residues.


    The surface morphology shows the characteristic roughness of planed poplar (approximately 3.2 µm Ra), confirming the selective
    nature of the ablation process. The laser parameters were calibrated to remain below the wood''s ablation threshold of
    0.8 J/cm², ensuring precise removal of contaminants while preserving the underlying lignocellulosic structure. This results
    in a clean substrate where the intricate grain pattern and cellular detail are fully discernible, providing an optimal
    surface for subsequent treatments.'
