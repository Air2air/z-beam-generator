description: Technical overview of Granite, SiO2-Al2O3-K2O, for laser cleaning. Granite,
  a silicate-rich igneous rock composed primarily of quartz (SiO2), feldspar (Al2O3-K2O),
  and mica, offers unique challenges and advantages in laser cleaning applications.
  The high melting point and thermal conductivity of granite necessitate precise control
  of laser parameters to avoid thermal damage while effectively removing contaminants.
  The non-contact nature of laser cleaning is particularly advantageous for preserving
  the integrity of the granite's surface and structure, making it ideal for restoration
  and construction applications.
