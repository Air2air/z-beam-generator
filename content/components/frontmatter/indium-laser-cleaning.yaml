caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the indium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-10
    micrometers thick. This layer appears as a topographical map of amorphous, dark particulate matter intermixed with crystalline
    deposits. The underlying metal''s texture is completely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked-mudflat pattern, with fissures revealing slight glimpses of the substrate. Energy-dispersive
    X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) would likely identify these particulates as oxides and embedded environmental dust. The surface
    is characterized by high micro-roughness, which would interfere with processes requiring atomic-level contact, such as
    cold welding or high-vacuum sealing.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the intrinsic grain structure of the
    indium. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey appearance with clearly defined polygonal grain boundaries. The
    micro-roughness has been significantly reduced, presenting a topography consistent with the base metal''s properties.


    The transformation is evident in the absence of particulate matter and the restoration of the metal''s natural texture.
    This cleaned surface provides the necessary atomic-level cleanliness for high-performance applications, ensuring optimal
    adhesion and sealing integrity.'
