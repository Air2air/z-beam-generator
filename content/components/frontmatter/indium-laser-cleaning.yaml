caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the indium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, organic residues, and a thin, discontinuous oxide film (In₂O₃). The underlying metal's soft, ductile character is masked by this topography, which exhibits a mottled, high-relief texture. Contaminants adhere within the natural grain boundaries and surface imperfections, creating a complex, irregular pattern that compromises surface integrity and electrical properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the intrinsic surface, revealing the pure indium's fine, coherent grain structure at 500x magnification. The contamination layer is entirely removed, leaving a smooth, reflective plane with minimal micro-roughness. The surface is now defined by its metallic luster and clean grain boundaries, free from embedded particulates and oxide films. This state ensures optimal electrical contact and adhesion for subsequent processes.
