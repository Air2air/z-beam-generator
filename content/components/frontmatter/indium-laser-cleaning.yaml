caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the indium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of carbonaceous
    deposits, adsorbed hydrocarbons, and a thin, amorphous indium oxide (In₂O₃) film.
    The underlying metal's soft, ductile character is masked by a textured, matte
    topography with visible particulate entrapment and smeared residues from previous
    handling. The contamination scatters light, giving the surface a dull, non-reflective
    appearance and disrupting its intrinsic metallic luster.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the intrinsic surface morphology of the indium.
    At 500x, the surface now exhibits a uniform, reflective finish with clearly defined
    grain boundaries. The contamination layer has been completely removed via ablation,
    revealing the pure, soft metal substrate. The surface is smooth and continuous,
    with a significant restoration of specular reflectivity and no evidence of thermal
    damage or melting to the underlying structure.
