        research_basis: Indium exhibits high resistance to corrosion in atmospheric
          conditions and by many alkalis. It does not oxidize easily in air and is
          stable in water, contributing to its use in protective coatings and solders.
          Its primary vulnerability is to certain strong acids and halogens.

        research_basis: Indium has a low melting point of 156.6 °C. Authoritative
          sources like the ASM Handbook indicate that while a thin oxide film forms
          at room temperature, significant oxidation that compromises the metal's
          integrity and usability begins at temperatures approaching its melting point,
          around 150 °C in air. This temperature is widely cited in materials science
          references as the practical upper limit for continuous service.

        research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal with a low melting
          point (156.6 °C). Its flexural strength is not a commonly reported property,
          as it is not a structural material and yields plastically under very low
          stress. The provided value is an estimate derived from its known ultimate
          tensile strength (2.5 - 3 MPa) and yield strength (1 - 11 MPa), as reported
          by MatWeb. For such a soft material, flexural strength in a 3-point bend
          test would be expected to be very low and comparable to its tensile strength.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure (99.97%) Indium is listed
          as 4.2 MPa (or 600 psi) on the authoritative MatWeb database. This low value
          is consistent with Indium's extreme softness and low hardness (0.9 MPa),
          as it is one of the softest metals. The value represents a standard test
          at room temperature.

        research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal (hardness ~0.9
          MPa) with a face-centered cubic crystal structure that allows for extensive
          plastic deformation. For such materials, linear elastic fracture mechanics
          (LEFM) and the concept of a valid K_IC are often not applicable as they
          yield extensively before fracture. The reported value is an extremely low
          estimate based on its correlation with yield strength and hardness for very
          soft, non-work-hardening metals, indicating it has virtually no resistance
          to crack propagation in the LEFM sense. Direct, standardized K_IC measurements
          for indium are not commonly reported in the literature due to its dominant
          ductility.
