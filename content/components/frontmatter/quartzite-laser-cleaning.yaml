caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the quartzite surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A carbonaceous soot deposit, approximately 5-10 µm thick,
    forms a discontinuous, amorphous crust. This layer is punctuated by embedded particulate
    matter, including silicate spheres and metallic oxides from industrial fallout.
    The underlying interlocking quartz matrix is largely hidden, with only the highest
    grain peaks visible. The contamination exhibits a craze-patterned texture, creating
    a topographical map of the surface's thermal and chemical degradation. This layer
    significantly alters the stone's intrinsic reflectivity and masks its natural
    crystalline structure.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the fully exposed, interlocking matrix of
    quartz crystals. The original grain boundaries and micro-fracture networks are
    now clearly defined and free of foreign material. The surface texture is consistent
    with the stone's natural morphology, with a measurable return to its baseline
    reflectivity and minimal residual thermal stress.
