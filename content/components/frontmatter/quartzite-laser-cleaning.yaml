caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the quartzite surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a matrix of organic residues, creating a
    discontinuous film that masks the underlying crystalline structure. The particulates, ranging from 1 to 5 micrometers
    in diameter, are firmly adhered to the stone.


    The contamination disrupts the natural surface texture, filling the micro-scale intergranular boundaries between quartz
    crystals. This results in a topographically muted appearance, where the inherent reflectivity of the quartz is significantly
    reduced. The layer exhibits a cracked, desiccated morphology, indicating its susceptibility to cohesive failure.'
  afterText: 'The laser cleaning process has resulted in the complete removal of the contamination layer, revealing the pristine
    quartzite substrate. The surface now exhibits the distinct, interlocking texture of recrystallized quartz grains, with
    sharp boundaries clearly visible. The micro-roughness inherent to the stone''s natural cleavage is fully restored, contrasting
    sharply with the previously muted and occluded surface.


    The removal is highly selective, as evidenced by the absence of thermal damage to the quartz crystals themselves. The
    mineral grains, with a Mohs hardness of 7, retain their structural integrity. The process has effectively cleared the
    intergranular boundaries, eliminating the particulate-filled matrix that was previously present.


    This restoration of the original microstructure has a direct impact on the surface''s optical properties. The cleaned
    quartzite now demonstrates significantly higher reflectivity, a direct result of exposing the crystalline faces. The surface
    is defined by its mineralogical composition, free from foreign material that altered its visual and physical characteristics.'
