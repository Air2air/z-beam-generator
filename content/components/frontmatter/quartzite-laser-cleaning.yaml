subtitle: Quartzite is exceptionally hard and non-porous, unlike other metamorphic
  stones. This density requires careful adjustment of laser power to avoid damaging
  its vitrified surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the quartzite surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous, carbonaceous soot deposit, measuring 5-15
    µm thick, adheres to the crystalline matrix. This layer is punctuated by embedded
    particulate matter, primarily silicates and metal oxides, which create localized
    topographical peaks. The underlying interlocking quartz grains are partially visible,
    with contaminants concentrated along crystal boundaries and micro-fractures, creating
    a darkened, textured appearance that masks the stone's inherent reflectivity and
    granular detail.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate's original morphology. The
    interlocking, anhedral quartz grains are now fully exposed, with sharp boundaries
    and a clean, micro-rough texture. The surface is free of obscuring deposits, revealing
    the stone's inherent crystalline structure and light-reflective properties. Minimal
    residual particulate remains isolated within deeper grain boundaries.
