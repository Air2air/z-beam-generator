          Durability Classifications
        research_basis: Limestone is a calcium carbonate-based rock highly susceptible
          to chemical weathering from acidic environments (acid rain, urban pollution).
          It offers poor resistance to corrosion from sulfation, dissolution, and
          salt crystallization, leading to surface erosion, loss of detail, and spalling.
          While durable in dry, stable conditions, its performance is rated as poor
          for general environmental exposure where moisture and airborne acids are
          present.

          R.S., "Chemistry and Technology of Lime and Limestone."'
        research_basis: Limestone (CaCO₃) does not oxidize; it undergoes thermal decomposition
          (calcination) in air. Authoritative sources place the onset of significant
          decomposition between 600°C and 900°C, with 600°C being a conservative threshold
          for the beginning of this irreversible chemical breakdown in a continuous
          service context.

        source: ASTM C880 / C880M - Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of
          Dimension Stone (4-point bend test)
        research_basis: The flexural strength of limestone is not a fixed material
          constant like compressive strength but falls within a typical range. ASTM
          C880 provides the standard testing method for dimension stone. Data from
          the Natural Stone Institute and other technical sources (e.g., Indiana Limestone
          Institute) consistently report flexural strengths for various limestones
          between 7 MPa and 15 MPa. The value of 10.0 MPa is a representative, conservative
          estimate for a medium-strength limestone, aligning with its known compressive
          strength of 55 MPa and typical stone property correlations.

        research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 55.0 MPa is characteristic
          of a relatively low-strength limestone. Fracture toughness (K_IC) for limestone
          is strongly correlated with its compressive strength and porosity. For limestones
          in this strength range, the widely cited compilation by Atkinson & Meredith
          reports K_IC values typically falling between 0.6 and 1.0 MPa·√m, with 0.8
          MPa·√m being a representative median value for this material class.
