caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated limestone surface is characterized by a discontinuous, particulate-laden
    layer averaging 15-25 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists of agglomerated carbonaceous soot and mineral dust
    particles, ranging from 2 to 8 micrometers in diameter, embedded within a porous matrix of biological growth and hydrocarbon
    residues. The underlying limestone''s natural calcite crystals are partially obscured, with their characteristic rhombohedral
    cleavage planes visible only in isolated areas.


    The contamination exhibits significant surface heterogeneity, with dense particulate accumulations concentrated within
    the stone''s natural micro-porosity (typically 5-10 micrometer features). This creates a textured, irregular topography
    that masks the substrate''s true morphology. The particulate matter shows weak adhesion to the limestone, forming a friable,
    non-cohesive layer that bridges across surface micro-features rather than conforming to them.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, microscopic examination at 500x reveals complete removal of the particulate contamination
    layer, restoring the intrinsic surface morphology of the limestone substrate. The previously obscured calcite crystal
    structure is now fully exposed, displaying well-defined intercrystalline boundaries and characteristic rhombohedral cleavage
    planes. The surface presents a uniform, mineralogically authentic appearance with no evidence of residual contamination
    within the natural porosity.


    The transformation is particularly evident in the restoration of micro-scale surface features. The stone''s original texture,
    including subtle crystalline facets and grain boundaries, is now clearly visible without the masking effect of the 15-25
    micrometer contamination layer. The cleaning process has achieved selective ablation of contaminants while preserving
    the structural integrity of the underlying limestone, as confirmed by the absence of thermal alteration features or micro-fracturing
    at the crystal boundaries.


    Comparative analysis confirms the procedure''s precision: the laser parameters were calibrated below the limestone''s
    ablation threshold of 1.5 J/cm², ensuring removal occurred exclusively within the contamination layer. This is evidenced
    by the sharp definition of crystalline features and the maintenance of the stone''s natural micro-porosity network, which
    now appears clean and open rather than filled with particulate matter. The surface now exhibits the expected reflectivity
    and color of pure calcite without artificial darkening or residue.'
