caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the limestone surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter (soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of gypsum and other sulfation crusts,
    a product of atmospheric pollutant reaction with the calcite substrate. The underlying
    stone's crystalline structure and natural porosity are completely masked, presenting
    a uniform, crusted texture that compromises the material's vapor permeability
    and visual integrity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has selectively ablated the contamination crust, revealing
    the original limestone microstructure. The calcite crystal faces and intercrystalline
    boundaries are now clearly defined, restoring the stone's natural porosity and
    pale substrate color. The surface is free of discoloration, with no thermal damage
    to the mineral lattice.
