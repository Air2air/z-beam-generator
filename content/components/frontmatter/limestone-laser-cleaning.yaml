caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the limestone surface is obscured by a complex,
    stratified contamination layer. A dense, amorphous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers
    thick, adheres tenaciously to the stone matrix. This crust, primarily composed
    of carbonaceous particulates, gypsum, and hydrocarbon deposits, exhibits a fractured,
    dendritic morphology that penetrates the stone's natural micropores (approx. 5%
    porosity). The underlying calcite crystals are visually inaccessible, their characteristic
    rhombohedral cleavage planes entirely masked. The contaminant layer displays significant
    topographical variation, with localized pitting and micro-fractures that create
    a rough, highly irregular surface texture, increasing the effective surface area
    for further degradation.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the fundamental limestone microstructure.
    The contaminant crust is entirely removed, revealing the pristine, interlocking
    calcite crystals beneath. The surface now exhibits the mineral's inherent rhombohedral
    cleavage planes and a uniform, micro-textured finish. The stone's natural porosity
    is visible and unobstructed, with no evidence of the previous sub-surface contamination
    or micro-fracturing induced by the crust.

subtitle: Operators have learned that limestone performs best when you start with
  minimal power, around 20 watts. Adjust slowly to avoid uneven removal, since its
  porous face can absorb energy inconsistently during treatment.
