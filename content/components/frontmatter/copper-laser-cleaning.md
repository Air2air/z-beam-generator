description: Technical overview of Copper, Cu, for laser cleaning. Copper, a highly
  conductive metal with the chemical symbol Cu, is ideal for laser cleaning due to
  its reflective properties and high thermal conductivity. Laser cleaning techniques
  such as ablation and non-contact cleaning are effective for removing surface contaminants,
  corrosion, and oxidation from copper, enhancing its utility in manufacturing and
  restoration applications.
