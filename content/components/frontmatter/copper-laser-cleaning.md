description: Technical overview of Copper, Cu, for laser cleaning. Copper, symbolized
  as Cu and commonly found in pure form, exhibits excellent electrical and thermal
  conductivity, making it a prime candidate for laser cleaning applications. The process
  involves the use of a 1064nm wavelength laser, which effectively removes surface
  contaminants like oxides and corrosion from copper surfaces, ensuring enhanced adhesion
  in manufacturing and restoration of historical copper artifacts. The laser cleaning
  method is non-contact, preserving the integrity of the copper while achieving precise
  cleaning results.
