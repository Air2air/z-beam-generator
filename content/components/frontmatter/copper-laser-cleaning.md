description: Technical overview of Copper, Cu, for laser cleaning. Copper, a ductile
  and malleable metal with excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, is widely
  used in various industries. Laser cleaning of copper using a 1064nm wavelength and
  a fluence range of 0.5-5 J/cm² effectively removes surface contaminants, corrosion,
  and oxidation, ensuring enhanced surface quality and adhesion properties for subsequent
  processes.
