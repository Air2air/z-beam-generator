caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the gallium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 2-5
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a carbonaceous film, creating a textured, matte appearance.
    The underlying metallic luster of the gallium is completely absent.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, a result of solvent evaporation and the adsorption of atmospheric
    hydrocarbons. Scattered micro-droplets, likely from prior handling, are visible, further disrupting the surface topography.
    The native orthorhombic crystalline structure of the gallium is entirely concealed beneath this discontinuous, optically
    dense layer.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The matte, textured contamination layer has
    been completely removed, revealing the underlying gallium''s smooth, reflective surface. The characteristic metallic luster
    is now restored, with a reflectivity measured at approximately 71%.


    The laser process has exposed the gallium''s native orthorhombic grain structure, visible as subtle, interlocking crystalline
    domains. No residual carbon film or micro-particulates are observed at this magnification. The surface is now continuous
    and uniform, with the cleaning process leaving no measurable ablation marks or thermal distortion on the pristine metal
    substrate.'
