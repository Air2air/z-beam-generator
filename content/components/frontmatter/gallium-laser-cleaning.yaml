caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the gallium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 2-5 micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    oxide patches (Ga₂O₃) and embedded particulate matter, creating a topographically
    complex and irregular surface. The underlying crystalline structure of the gallium
    is entirely masked. The contaminant film exhibits low adhesion to the soft metal
    substrate, resulting in a cracked, island-like pattern across the field of view,
    which significantly increases light scattering and reduces surface reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a visually distinct surface, revealing the underlying
    orthorhombic crystalline structure of the gallium. The previous 2-5 µm contamination
    layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation. The surface now
    appears smooth and highly reflective, with sub-micrometer roughness. The process
    successfully eliminated the oxide patches and particulate matter without inducing
    surface melting or altering the gallium's microstructure, restoring the metal's
    intrinsic metallic luster and topological integrity.
