caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the gallium surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous film,
    measuring 5-15 µm thick, adheres to the substrate. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and fine, embedded
    particulate matter, creating a topographically varied and irregular surface texture. The underlying gallium''s metallic
    luster is entirely absent, replaced by a matte, dark appearance.


    The contamination does not form a uniform coat but exhibits island-like growth patterns and dendritic spreading. These
    features suggest the contaminants migrated across the surface while the gallium was in its liquid phase, solidifying into
    a mechanically bonded, non-uniform crust. This layer significantly disrupts the native surface morphology and compromises
    the material''s functional properties.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The contamination
    layer has been entirely removed via selective laser ablation, exposing the pristine gallium substrate. The surface now
    exhibits a uniform, clean metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries. Minor, sub-micrometer laser texturing
    is visible, resulting from the precise vaporization of contaminants without damaging the underlying metal.


    The process has restored the surface to its native state, eliminating the previous non-uniform crust. The reflectivity
    and surface energy are now consistent with pure gallium, providing an optimal base for subsequent manufacturing steps.
    The cleaning has achieved a visually and functionally homogeneous surface.'
