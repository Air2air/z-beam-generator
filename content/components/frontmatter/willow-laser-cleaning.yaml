caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the willow surface is dominated by a discontinuous layer of particulate and biological
    contamination. Soot and mineral particles, ranging from 5 to 40 micrometers in diameter, are embedded within a porous,
    amorphous matrix, likely composed of degraded organic films. This composite layer, with a variable thickness of 15-50
    micrometers, obscures the underlying wood''s cellular structure.


    The contamination infiltrates the wood''s natural porosity (approximately 65%), filling vessel elements and lumens. The
    surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated deposits creating a topographical map that masks the true surface
    roughness of the willow substrate. The grain pattern is only partially visible where the contamination layer is thinnest.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The heterogeneous contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine willow substrate. The wood''s intricate cellular anatomy, including
    the distinct boundaries of longitudinal tracheids and ray parenchyma, is now fully visible and unobstructed.


    The surface roughness has been significantly reduced to near the native state of approximately 12.5 µm Ra, as the process
    has ablated the contamination without substantial material loss from the wood itself. The high porosity of the willow
    is now evident as clean, open lumens, free of particulate matter. The laser''s selective ablation, operating above the
    1.8 J/cm² threshold for contaminants but below the damage threshold for sound wood, has preserved the structural integrity
    of the surface fibers.'
