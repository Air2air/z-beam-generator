subtitle: Willow has a softer, more porous surface with prominent grain patterns than most softwoods. This requires lower laser power settings and careful beam scanning to avoid scorching the delicate fibers.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the willow surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, embedded within a matrix of aged, cross-linked organic residues. The underlying wood cell structure is partially masked, with contaminants filling the porous lumen of vessels and fibers. The surface texture appears uneven and occluded, disrupting the natural grain pattern.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the microscopic view reveals a complete restoration of the willow''s native surface topography. The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the well-defined cellular structure of the wood. Vessel elements and fiber cells are now clearly visible, with their open lumens and distinct cell walls.


    The process has successfully ablated the foreign material without inducing thermal degradation to the underlying wood substrate, which has a pyrolysis temperature of 280°C. The laser''s precise energy delivery, calibrated below the 1.8 J/cm² ablation threshold of clean willow, selectively targeted the contaminants.


    The resulting surface exhibits the intrinsic porosity (approximately 65%) and grain pattern of the wood. This non-abrasive cleaning preserves the structural integrity of the delicate surface fibers, maintaining the material''s original mechanical and aesthetic properties for applications demanding precision.'
