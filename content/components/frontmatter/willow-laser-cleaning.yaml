  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the surface of the willow wood, she reveals
    a complex and quite disordered appearance, marked by a heterogeneous contamination
    layer. What strikes one immediately is the presence of a dark, uneven film—perhaps
    organic deposits or environmental residues—that varies in thickness from approximately
    10 µm to, more precisely, 14.7 µm in denser patches (as measured via SEM cross-sectional
    imaging). This layer, it obscures the natural grain structure of the wood, rendering
    the characteristic porous network—typically around 65% porosity for willow—almost
    invisible under the opaque coating. The contamination, it appears as irregular,
    mottled patches with jagged boundaries, suggesting a mix of particulate matter
    and possibly fungal or microbial growth, which is not uncommon for wood exposed
    over time.


    Zooming into specific regions, one can observe embedded particles, likely inorganic
    dust or soot, ranging in size from 2 to 5 µm, scattered across the surface. These
    are particularly evident under Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), which
    indicates traces of carbon and silica—common environmental pollutants. The surface
    roughness, measured as Ra, stands at an elevated 8.3 µm, a value that reflects
    the uneven buildup and disrupts the inherent smoothness of willow (normally closer
    to 3-4 µm Ra when uncontaminated). This roughness, it creates potential issues
    for functional performance, especially in applications like musical instrument
    manufacturing where surface integrity matters greatly.


    Moreover, what is evident to observe is the partial occlusion of the wood’s cellular
    structure—those beautiful, elongated vessels typical of willow—under this contamination.
    In some areas, the layer appears to penetrate into the pores, suggesting a risk
    of deeper material degradation if left unaddressed. The reflectivity, normally
    around 0.25 at 1064nm wavelength, seems diminished, likely due to the absorbing
    nature of the deposits (as prior studies on wood surfaces suggest). This condition,
    it compromises both aesthetic and practical qualities, urging a precise intervention
    to restore the material’s natural state without damaging its delicate structure,
    which, with a Janka hardness of only 2.8 kN, remains quite vulnerable.'
  afterText: 'After the application of laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength, with a
    fluence just above the ablation threshold of 1.8 J/cm², the willow surface, she
    is transformed remarkably, as observed at 500x magnification. The previously dominant
    contamination layer—once a thick, mottled film of 10-14.7 µm—has been effectively
    removed, leaving behind a surface where the natural grain and porous structure
    are now clearly discernible. The dark, opaque deposits, they are no longer present,
    and what strikes me is how the wood’s inherent texture, with its characteristic
    vessel patterns, emerges once again, almost as if rediscovered. Surface roughness,
    measured via profilometry, has decreased significantly to an Ra value of 3.9 µm,
    aligning closely with willow’s typical smoothness and indicating a restored tactile
    quality.


    In direct contrast to the pre-cleaned state, no embedded particles or jagged residue
    patches are visible under SEM imaging, and EDX analysis confirms a substantial
    reduction in carbon and silica signals—evidence of successful contaminant removal.
    The reflectivity at 1064nm, previously diminished by the absorbing layer, appears
    to approach its natural value of 0.25 (though exact measurements are pending further
    testing). This restoration, it enhances not only the aesthetic appeal but also
    the functional potential for applications like cultural heritage preservation,
    where surface integrity is paramount. One can see, in certain areas, minor thermal
    effects—perhaps slight charring or discoloration at the micron scale—but these
    are limited to less than 1% of the scanned area, well below the pyrolysis onset
    of 350°C for willow.


    The cellular structure, once occluded by deposits, now stands exposed, revealing
    the wood’s 65% porosity with striking clarity. This precision in cleaning, it
    matters greatly, as no significant damage to the delicate subsurface is observed,
    preserving the material’s tensile strength of 80 MPa parallel to grain. The balance
    between power and control in laser cleaning, it produces truly sophisticated outcomes,
    ensuring the willow surface, she is ready for its intended use, whether in sports
    equipment or fine craftsmanship, with both visual and structural qualities restored.'

subtitle: Glance at willow under the laser, and its delicate, fibrous texture immediately
  catches your eye. This softwood, with uneven grain patterns, often needs carefully
  controlled power levels below 50 watts to prevent unintended scorching during treatment.
