        research_basis: Willow is a non-durable hardwood with low natural decay resistance.
          The Wood Handbook classifies it as perishable (service life <5 years in
          ground contact), placing it in the lowest durability category. Its low density
          (0.45 g/cm³) and porous structure make it highly susceptible to moisture,
          fungal decay, and environmental degradation without preservative treatment.

          Report FPL-GTR-282.'
        research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for wood is not a single,
          precisely defined point like for metals, but is instead the temperature
          at which significant thermal degradation begins in air. For all wood species,
          including willow, this process initiates significantly around 200°C, leading
          to pyrolysis, charring, and a loss of mechanical integrity. The primary
          source of variation is moisture content and heating duration, not wood species,
          as the main chemical components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) degrade
          in a similar temperature range across all species.

        research_basis: The flexural strength (MOR) for Willow wood is consistently
          reported in the range of 50-70 MPa in wood material science references.
          The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties, lists a
          modulus of rupture of 60 MPa for Willow, which aligns with the expected
          range for a low-density hardwood and is derived from standardized 3-point
          or 4-point bend tests (ASTM D143).

        research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
          lists the compressive strength of Willow (Salix species) parallel to the
          grain as 4.0 MPa. This value is consistent with willow being a low-density
          wood, and the provided density of 0.45 g/cm³ falls within the typical range
          for willow, supporting the plausibility of this strength figure.
