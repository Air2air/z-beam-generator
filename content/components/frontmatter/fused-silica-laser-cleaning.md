description: Fused Silica, composed of SiO2, is a high-purity glass utilized extensively
  in laser cleaning applications due to its exceptional thermal and optical properties.
  Its high melting point and low thermal expansion enable it to withstand the intense
  energy of laser pulses, making it ideal for non-contact cleaning methods like laser
  ablation. This process effectively removes contaminants from the surface while preserving
  the integrity and precision of the substrate, which is crucial in applications such
  as semiconductor manufacturing and optics.
