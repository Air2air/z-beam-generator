description: Laser cleaning of fused silica utilizes precise pulsed fiber lasers to remove surface contaminants without damaging the substrate. The process exploits the high transparency of fused silica at 1064nm, allowing laser energy to pass through the material and selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the optical quality of the substrate.
