caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of a porous,
    amorphous matrix of magnesium oxide and hydroxide, intermixed with embedded carbonaceous
    particulates from handling and environmental exposure. The underlying HCP crystalline
    structure is entirely hidden. The topography is characterized by irregular, crust-like
    formations that increase the effective surface roughness to approximately 2.5-4.0
    µm Ra, creating micro-crevices that trap further contaminants and initiate localized
    corrosion.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the pristine
    magnesium substrate. The surface now exhibits the fine, directional machining
    marks from the original processing, with a measured roughness reduced to near
    the base material's 0.8 µm Ra. The homogeneous, metallic surface is free of oxide
    patches and embedded particulates, exposing the underlying grain structure. This
    provides an optimal, chemically uniform surface for subsequent processes like
    bonding or coating.
