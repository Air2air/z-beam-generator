caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a porous,
    granular texture with localized oxide nodules and embedded particulate matter.
    The underlying HCP crystalline structure is entirely masked, and the original
    metallic luster is absent due to light scattering from the rough, discontinuous
    contaminant film.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine magnesium substrate, characterized
    by distinct grain boundaries and micro-polishing effects. The surface is now free
    of oxides and particulates, restoring its inherent metallic reflectivity. Minor,
    sub-micron laser interaction traces are visible, but the original surface integrity
    is maintained with no evidence of thermal damage, such as melting or micro-cracking.

subtitle: Handling magnesium in laser cleaning requires a sharp eye for detail, as
  its lightweight nature can mislead you on heat buildup. Adjust power levels carefully
  below 50 watts to safeguard the delicate finish from unintended warping.
