caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring between
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of a matrix of oxide particles (MgO) and embedded carbonaceous deposits from
    environmental exposure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated particulate matter creating a topographical
    landscape of peaks and valleys that mask the underlying metal''s true structure.


    The contamination adheres in a patchy, discontinuous pattern, with some areas showing dense, crust-like formations and
    others exhibiting a more porous, sooty appearance. Fine micro-cracks are visible within the thicker oxide regions, a result
    of differing thermal expansion rates between the brittle oxide and the more ductile magnesium substrate. The native hexagonal
    close-packed (HCP) crystalline structure of the magnesium is entirely concealed beneath this contaminated crust.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is definitive. The previously dominant
    5-15 micrometer contamination layer has been completely removed via laser ablation, revealing the pristine, underlying
    magnesium substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic fine grain structure of the metal''s HCP crystalline
    arrangement, which was entirely concealed before. The visual contrast is stark, shifting from an obscured, textured crust
    to a clean, metallic surface.


    The process has left a uniform, matte-finish texture with a measured surface roughness (Ra) of approximately 0.8 micrometers.
    The laser''s controlled energy has effectively vaporized contaminants without melting or damaging the base metal, preserving
    its mechanical integrity. Isolated, shallow micro-pits are visible where the laser energy selectively ablated tenacious
    oxide inclusions, providing direct evidence of the precise, layer-by-layer contaminant removal. The surface is now optimally
    prepared for subsequent processes like coating or bonding.'
