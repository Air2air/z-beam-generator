description: Magnesium (Mg), a lightweight metal, is increasingly utilized in industries
  like aerospace and automotive due to its favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Laser
  cleaning of magnesium involves using a 1064nm wavelength laser with a pulse duration
  of 10-100ns and a fluence range of 0.5–5 J/cm², which effectively removes contaminants
  and oxidation without damaging the underlying material. This process is crucial
  for maintaining the integrity and performance of magnesium components, leveraging
  the non-contact nature of laser ablation for precision cleaning.
