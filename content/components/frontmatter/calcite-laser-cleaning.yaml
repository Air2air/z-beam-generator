caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the calcite surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous film, measuring 5-15 µm thick, adheres to
    the crystalline structure. This layer consists of particulate matter, such as
    soot and dust, embedded within a matrix of hygroscopic salts and organic residues.
    The underlying calcite's characteristic rhombohedral cleavage planes and surface
    texture are partially masked. The contamination follows an uneven, patchy distribution,
    with thicker accretions concentrated in micro-fissures and surface depressions,
    creating a topographically complex and optically opaque surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic surface morphology. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed, revealing the pristine, well-defined geometry
    of the calcite's crystalline structure. The characteristic rhombohedral cleavage
    planes and sharp crystal edges are now fully visible and tactually distinct. The
    surface exhibits minimal micro-fracturing or thermal alteration, confirming the
    process operated below the material's 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold. This results
    in a topographically uniform surface with restored optical clarity.
