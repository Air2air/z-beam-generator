subtitle: Calcite is a soft and chemically reactive mineral, unlike harder, more inert stones. Its sensitivity therefore demands lower laser power and careful wavelength selection to prevent damage.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the calcite surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of particulate matter and organic films, masks the underlying crystalline structure and rhombohedral cleavage planes. The surface texture appears irregular and matte, with contaminants filling micro-fractures and adhering to topographic features, creating a heterogeneous and occluded appearance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine, well-defined rhombohedral cleavage planes and crystal facets. The surface now exhibits a uniform, vitreous luster with sub-micron precision, eliminating all observed particulate matter and organic residues without subsurface damage.
