caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the calcite surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a complex
    morphology of particulate matter, soot agglomerates, and amorphous organic deposits,
    which mask the underlying crystal structure. The contaminants have infiltrated
    surface micro-fractures and adhere to cleavage planes, creating a mottled, high-relief
    texture that significantly increases light scattering and reduces surface clarity.
    The original rhombohedral crystal faces are no longer discernible.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic calcite surface, revealing
    the distinct rhombohedral cleavage and sharp crystal edges at 500x magnification.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed, eliminating light-scattering
    particulates and exposing the original, planar microstructure. The surface now
    exhibits low topographic relief and high reflectivity, with sub-micron laser ablation
    tracks visible as fine, parallel striations that do not compromise the structural
    integrity of the substrate.
