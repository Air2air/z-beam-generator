caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the calcite surface is obscured by a heterogeneous
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, such as soot and dust, embedded within a matrix of organic compounds and
    hygroscopic salts. The underlying rhombohedral crystal structure is largely hidden.
    The surface texture is irregular and matte, with contaminants filling natural
    cleavage planes and micro-fractures, creating a discontinuous, blotchy pattern
    that scatters incident light and reduces surface clarity.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the restoration of the intrinsic
    calcite surface. The contamination layer has been selectively removed, exposing
    the pristine, well-defined rhombohedral crystal structure and sharp cleavage planes.
    The surface texture is now smooth and continuous, with a notable return of vitreous
    luster. The removal of light-scattering contaminants results in significantly
    improved optical transmission and a homogeneous surface topography.
