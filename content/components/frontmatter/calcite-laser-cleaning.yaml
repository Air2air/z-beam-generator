caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the calcite surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a dark, tenacious crust that fills the natural micro-fissures
    and cleavage planes characteristic of the mineral. The surface texture is highly irregular, with the contaminants forming
    a matte, occluding film that prevents observation of the underlying crystalline structure. The original surface morphology
    is no longer discernible.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic surface morphology, revealing the calcite's characteristic rhombohedral
    cleavage planes and micro-texture. The previously occluding contamination layer has been completely removed, with no residual
    crust observed within the fissures. The surface now exhibits a consistent, clean substrate with clearly defined crystalline
    features. This confirms the selective ablation process successfully targeted the contaminants while preserving the mineral's
    structural integrity.
