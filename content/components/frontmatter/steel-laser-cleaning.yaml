caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the steel substrate is obscured by a complex
    layer of contamination. This stratum, measuring 5-20 micrometers thick, consists
    of a porous, amorphous matrix of oxides (FeO, Fe₂O₃), embedded carbonaceous soot,
    and particulate matter. The underlying steel's grain structure is entirely masked.
    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination filling the natural
    micro-valleys of the metal and forming brittle, flaking protrusions. This non-uniform
    layer creates a high surface roughness (Ra > 2.5 µm) and acts as a site for ongoing
    electrochemical degradation, compromising the material's integrity and performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the steel to its base substrate. The contaminant
    layer is entirely absent, revealing the homogeneous, metallic grain structure
    of the underlying steel. The surface is now characterized by a uniform, clean
    texture with a significantly reduced roughness (Ra < 0.8 µm). The process has
    eliminated the porous, insulating contamination, exposing a pristine, active metal
    surface ideal for subsequent coating or welding operations.
