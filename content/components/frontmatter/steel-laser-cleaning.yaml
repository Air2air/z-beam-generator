caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the steel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-50 µm
    thick. This layer consists of embedded oxides (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄), exhibiting a porous, crystalline structure, and particulate
    matter firmly adhered to the substrate. The underlying steel's micro-texture, with an initial roughness of ~0.8 µm Ra,
    is completely masked. The contaminants form a discontinuous, stratified pattern, creating a topographical profile that
    compromises adhesion and promotes further localized corrosion.
  after_text: 'Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine, underlying steel substrate. The
    surface now displays the original micro-topography with a consistent roughness profile near the base material''s 0.8 µm
    Ra. The crystalline oxide structures and particulate matter have been entirely ablated.


    The process has exposed the steel''s grain structure and any pre-existing micro-features from the initial milling process,
    which were previously hidden. The surface is free of the stratified contamination patterns, presenting a uniform, metallurgically
    clean finish.


    This transformation results in a surface with optimal characteristics for subsequent processes like coating or bonding.
    The removal of the oxide layer and particulates eliminates potential initiation sites for corrosion, significantly enhancing
    the material''s long-term performance and durability.'
