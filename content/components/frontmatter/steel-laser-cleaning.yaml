  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the steel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of a complex matrix of iron oxide (rust) crystals, appearing as porous, reddish-brown nodules, intermixed with embedded carbonaceous soot particles. The underlying steel's metallic luster is completely absent.\n\nThe surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination forming jagged peaks and valleys. The oxide layer exhibits micro-cracking and spallation, where sections have begun to detach from the substrate. This heterogeneous coverage creates a topographically complex landscape that masks the true, smooth surface of the base metal, compromising its functional properties."
  "afterText": "Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The thick, irregular contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the underlying steel substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, light-gray, matte finish with a fine, consistent micro-texture.\n\nThe cleaning process has restored the steel's intrinsic metallic character without the melting or pitting that can occur with abrasive methods. The original machining marks and grain structure of the base metal are now clearly visible. This pristine, oxide-free surface provides an optimal foundation for subsequent processes like coating, welding, or bonding, ensuring maximum adhesion and performance."
