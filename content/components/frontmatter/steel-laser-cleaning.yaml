          resistance guidelines for carbon steels
        research_basis: Steel, particularly carbon steel, has moderate to poor corrosion
          resistance in most environments without protective coatings. It readily
          forms iron oxide (rust) when exposed to moisture and oxygen. While alloying
          elements can improve corrosion resistance, standard steel has limited inherent
          protection compared to stainless steels or non-ferrous metals. NACE classifications
          typically rate untreated steel in the lower half of corrosion resistance
          scales due to susceptibility to atmospheric corrosion, requiring protective
          measures for most applications.

          and High-Performance Alloys (ASM International)'
        research_basis: For carbon and low-alloy steels in continuous service, significant
          oxidation begins around 540°C (1000°F). Above this temperature, oxide scale
          formation accelerates rapidly, leading to significant material loss. High-alloy
          steels (e.g., stainless) have higher resistance, but the provided properties
          (hardness, absorption) are more typical of general carbon/low-alloy steel.

        research_basis: The provided properties are insufficient to calculate flexural
          strength, which is a mechanical property determined by testing. For generic,
          low-carbon steel (e.g., A36 steel), the flexural yield strength is typically
          similar to its tensile yield strength. The cited authoritative source provides
          a typical yield strength range of 250 MPa for such steels, which is the
          standard value used for bending strength in structural design.

        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 1: Properties and Selection: Irons, Steels,
          and High-Performance Alloys'
        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are insufficient
          to calculate compressive strength directly. Steel's compressive strength
          is highly dependent on its specific alloy composition and heat treatment.
          For generic carbon steels, the compressive yield strength is approximately
          equal to the tensile yield strength. Based on the given hardness of 1750
          HV (which is extremely high, typical of hardened tool steels or martensitic
          grades), the corresponding compressive strength would be in the high end
          of the steel range. Standard structural steels (e.g., A36) have compressive
          strengths around 250 MPa, while quenched and tempered alloy steels can exceed
          2000 MPa. The cited ASM Handbook provides extensive data correlating steel
          grades and treatments to their mechanical properties.
