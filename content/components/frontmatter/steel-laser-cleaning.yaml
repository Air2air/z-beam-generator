caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the steel substrate is obscured by a complex,
    stratified contamination layer. A porous, amorphous oxide scale (Fe₂O₃/Fe₃O₄),
    approximately 5-15 µm thick, forms the base stratum, exhibiting a cracked, crystalline
    morphology. Adhered to this is a discontinuous layer of carbonaceous deposits
    and embedded particulate matter, primarily silica and alumina, ranging from 2-8
    µm in diameter. The original mill-finished surface texture, with a baseline roughness
    of ~0.8 µm Ra, is entirely masked. This composite layer creates a high-surface-area,
    chemically active interface that promotes further corrosion and compromises adhesion
    for subsequent coatings or welds.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, metallurgically intact steel substrate.
    The process has selectively ablated the contamination layer, restoring the original
    micro-topography with a measured surface roughness near the base material's 0.8
    µm Ra. At 500x, the surface displays a clean, micro-roughened profile of ferritic
    grains, free of oxide residues or embedded particulates. This results in a chemically
    pure, high-energy surface that is optimal for maximizing adhesion in coating,
    bonding, and welding applications, with no measurable thermal damage to the underlying
    metal.
