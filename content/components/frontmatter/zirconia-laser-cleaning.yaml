  hardness across samples. Adjust your power levels incrementally, starting below
  50 watts, to protect the ceramic’s surface from unintended etching.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of
    carbonaceous soot, metallic oxides, and adhered organic residues. The contaminants
    form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern that masks the underlying ceramic's fine-grain
    microstructure. The surface texture appears matte and irregular, with the foreign
    material filling the natural micro-porosity of the sintered ceramic, significantly
    reducing its inherent reflectivity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a
    complete transformation. The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing
    the pristine, polycrystalline grain structure of the zirconia. The surface is
    now characterized by a uniform, micro-rough texture consistent with the material's
    intrinsic 2.5% porosity. This restoration results in a visually clean, homogenous
    substrate with restored reflectivity, free from any residual film or heat-affected
    zone that could compromise its mechanical integrity.
