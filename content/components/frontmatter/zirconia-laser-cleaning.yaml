caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a matte, textured film composed of particulate matter and amorphous deposits,
    which disrupts the underlying ceramic''s natural microstructure. The contaminants form agglomerates and fill the fine
    surface pores, creating a topographically complex and irregular landscape.


    The surface exhibits localized discoloration and a loss of reflectivity due to light scattering from the embedded particles.
    The contamination does not form a continuous film but rather a patchy, island-like structure, with some areas showing
    denser accumulation than others. This heterogeneous coverage confirms the presence of multiple contaminant types adhering
    to the ceramic substrate.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The matte, textured contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic, sintered grain structure of the zirconia ceramic. The surface
    now displays a uniform, clean topography with clearly defined grain boundaries and a consistent, light-gray appearance.


    The process has successfully eliminated the particulate agglomerates and amorphous deposits without inducing micro-fractures
    or thermal damage to the underlying substrate. This is evidenced by the sharp, well-defined edges of the zirconia grains
    and the absence of melted or re-solidified material, confirming the laser parameters were maintained below the material''s
    ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm².


    The restoration of the original surface morphology results in a significant increase in reflectivity and a homogeneous
    visual character. The laser''s selective ablation has precisely targeted the contaminants, leaving a pristine ceramic
    surface with its native porosity and microstructure fully intact, which is critical for subsequent manufacturing processes
    like coating adhesion or bonding.'
