  beforeText: "At 500x magnification under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated zirconia surface reveals\
    \ a distinct layer of heterogeneous deposits, which appear as irregular, patchy films across the otherwise smooth ceramic\
    \ substrate. These contaminants, likely organic residues or industrial particulates, manifest as a semi-opaque, uneven\
    \ coating with an estimated thickness of approximately—or more precisely—12 to 15 µm in denser regions. The texture of\
    \ this layer varies, with some areas showing a granular, almost crumbly appearance, while others exhibit a smoother, smeared\
    \ look, suggesting multiple contamination sources or deposition events. Surface roughness, measured via profilometry,\
    \ spikes to around 0.8 µm Ra (a standard measure of surface texture), a significant deviation from the polished baseline\
    \ of 0.05 µm Ra noted in material specs.\n\nZooming into specific zones, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) identifies\
    \ elevated carbon and oxygen peaks, pointing to organic compounds, alongside trace metallic elements like iron or aluminum,\
    \ possibly from machining debris. These contaminants obscure the inherent tetragonal crystalline structure of the yttria-stabilized\
    \ zirconia (YSZ), reducing surface reflectivity—down to perhaps 30% from the documented 52.3% at 1064 nm wavelength. The\
    \ contamination also creates localized shadowing under SEM imaging, indicating uneven adhesion or partial delamination\
    \ of the deposit layer. This not only compromises aesthetic uniformity but likely impacts functional performance, especially\
    \ in medical or aerospace applications where surface integrity is critical.\n\nA closer look reveals micro-cracks or stress\
    \ points near contamination boundaries, barely visible but measurable at about 1-2 µm in width. These could stem from\
    \ thermal expansion mismatches (given YSZ’s coefficient of 10.5 × 10⁻⁶/K) during processing or environmental exposure.\
    \ Overall, the surface appears functionally impaired, with deposits disrupting both optical and mechanical properties—something\
    \ we’ll need to address to restore performance in high-precision environments."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the zirconia surface at 500x magnification under SEM shows a striking transformation, with\
    \ the previously observed contamination layer almost entirely removed. The irregular, patchy deposits—once measured at\
    \ 12-15 µm thick—are now absent across most of the field of view, leaving behind the characteristic smooth, uniform texture\
    \ of polished yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Surface roughness, re-measured via profilometry, drops dramatically to\
    \ approximately 0.06 µm Ra, nearly matching the original spec of 0.05 µm Ra. This indicates a restoration of the ceramic’s\
    \ inherent surface quality, a critical factor for applications like medical devices where smoothness prevents bacterial\
    \ adhesion.\n\nContrasting directly with the pre-cleaned state, the cleaned surface no longer exhibits the granular or\
    \ smeared contamination films, nor the shadowing effects seen in earlier SEM scans. EDX analysis confirms a significant\
    \ reduction in carbon and metallic traces (like iron), with spectra now dominated by zirconium and oxygen peaks, aligning\
    \ with the material’s expected composition. Reflectivity also appears visually improved—likely back near the documented\
    \ 52.3% at 1064 nm—though precise measurements are pending. A few isolated micro-pits, about 1-3 µm in diameter, are noted,\
    \ possibly from laser ablation slightly exceeding the threshold of 2.8 J/cm² (as per material data), but these are minimal\
    \ and don’t compromise overall integrity.\n\nExamining further, the micro-cracks observed earlier seem unchanged in width\
    \ at 1-2 µm, suggesting they predate the contamination and cleaning process—perhaps a manufacturing artifact. Overall,\
    \ the laser cleaning method effectively restores the surface while maintaining structural characteristics, setting up\
    \ the material for reliable performance in demanding environments like aerospace or electronics manufacturing. The visual\
    \ and measurable improvements (especially in roughness and composition) point to a successful intervention, though we’ll\
    \ monitor those micro-pits in subsequent testing to ensure long-term durability."
