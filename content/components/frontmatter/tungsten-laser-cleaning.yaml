caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of adhered oxides,
    carbonaceous soot, and particulate debris, forming a textured, matte topography.
    The underlying metallic substrate is largely invisible, with the contamination
    masking the material's intrinsic grain structure and micro-features. The surface
    appears rough and irregular, with the contaminants filling microscopic valleys
    and pores.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the pristine
    tungsten substrate. The surface now exhibits a clean, defined grain structure
    with visible micro-features. The transformation results in a uniform, reflective
    metallic surface, restoring the material's intrinsic properties and eliminating
    the obscuring, textured contaminants.
