        research_basis: Tungsten exhibits excellent resistance to general atmospheric
          corrosion, freshwater, and seawater due to its protective oxide layer. It
          maintains stability in most acids, alkalis, and industrial chemicals at
          room temperature. The rating is reduced from "excellent" (9-10) due to its
          susceptibility to oxidation in air at elevated temperatures (>400°C) and
          vulnerability to certain specific corrosive agents like fluorine and hot
          concentrated acids.

        research_basis: Authoritative texts on tungsten consistently report that significant
          oxidation begins in air around 400-500°C, forming volatile WO₃. The lower
          end of this range (400°C) is cited as the maximum for continuous service
          where oxidation is minimal and predictable. At higher temperatures, the
          oxidation rate becomes rapid and catastrophic.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Tungsten and Tungsten Alloys"'
        research_basis: The provided flexural strength is a typical value for sintered,
          unalloyed tungsten. The ASM Handbook is a definitive reference for material
          properties. It is critical to note that tungsten's flexural strength is
          highly dependent on its processing (sintering, rolling, etc.) and purity.
          For high-purity, recrystallized tungsten, flexural strength can be significantly
          lower (around 550 MPa), while heavily worked or alloyed forms can exceed
          1000 MPa. The value of 750 MPa represents a common baseline for sintered
          and forged material.

          and Special-Purpose Materials" (1990), Table "Typical Room-Temperature Mechanical
          Properties of Tungsten".'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, recrystallized tungsten
          is significantly lower than its hardness and highly dependent on its form
          (e.g., pure sintered, wire-drawn) and test temperature. The cited value
          of 1510 MPa is a representative figure for the compressive yield strength
          (0.2% offset) of pure tungsten at room temperature, as established in authoritative
          materials handbooks. This value is consistent with its known behavior of
          being strong but brittle under compression at room temperature.
