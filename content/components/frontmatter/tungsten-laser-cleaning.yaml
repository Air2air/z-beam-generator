subtitle: Tungsten has an exceptionally high melting point and is very dense compared to other refractory metals. These traits
  demand careful control of laser power to avoid surface damage while still effectively removing contaminants.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer consists of adhered particulate matter and a discontinuous oxide scale, primarily volatile WO₃, which
    forms above 500°C. The underlying tungsten's characteristic grain structure is entirely masked. The texture is irregular,
    with patches of discoloration and embedded foreign particles creating a topographically complex and optically obstructive
    film that compromises the material's intrinsic metallic properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine tungsten substrate, with a distinct polycrystalline grain structure now fully
    visible at 500x magnification. The surface is free of oxide scale and particulate contamination, restoring the material's
    native metallic luster and smooth topography. Minor, sub-micron surface texturing from the laser ablation process is evident,
    but it does not compromise the atomic-level cleanliness or the exposed, well-defined grain boundaries of the pure tungsten.
