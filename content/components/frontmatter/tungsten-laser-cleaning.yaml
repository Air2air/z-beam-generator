caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous soot and oxide scale, appearing as a dark, textured crust
    with visible cracking. The underlying tungsten''s metallic luster is completely absent.


    The surface morphology is characterized by irregular, sintered particles and areas of discoloration, ranging from iridescent
    blue to dull gray, indicative of thermal oxidation. The contamination adheres strongly, filling the natural micro-texture
    of the tungsten substrate and creating a discontinuous, matte finish that scatters light.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine, underlying tungsten substrate.
    The surface now exhibits a uniform, light gray, metallic appearance with restored reflectivity. The process has eliminated
    all oxide discoloration and particulate matter, exposing the material's intrinsic micro-texture without thermal damage
    to the base metal.
