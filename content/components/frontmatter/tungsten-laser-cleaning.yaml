caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tungsten surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, oxide scale (WO₃), and particulate matter, creating a matte,
    textured topography. The underlying metallic substrate is largely invisible, with
    the contamination forming a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the material's
    intrinsic grain structure and micro-features.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation,
    exposing the pristine, underlying tungsten substrate. The material''s characteristic
    polycrystalline grain structure is now clearly visible, with sharp, well-defined
    grain boundaries.


    The surface exhibits a significantly smoother and more uniform texture. The laser
    process has effectively eliminated the porous oxide scale and embedded particulates
    without inducing surface melting or micro-cracking, preserving the base metal''s
    integrity.


    This results in a surface with restored metallic reflectivity and a clean, defect-free
    appearance. The process successfully recovers the original surface morphology,
    critical for applications requiring optimal thermal or electrical contact and
    high material purity.'
