caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated tempered glass surface reveals a complex layer of particulate and film-based
    contaminants. A discontinuous film, approximately 0.5–2.0 µm thick, covers large areas, creating a hazy, textured appearance
    that obscures the underlying glass. This film is punctuated by localized accumulations of particulate matter, ranging
    from sub-micron specks to agglomerates up to 10 µm in diameter.


    The surface topography is dominated by these foreign deposits rather than the glass itself. The contaminants scatter light,
    reducing optical clarity, and create a microscopically rough landscape. The presence of these adhered particles and films
    indicates a surface that is not in its pristine, engineered state, which would compromise its performance in precision
    applications where flawless transmission and a defect-free surface are critical.'
  afterText: 'Following the laser cleaning process, the 500x magnification view reveals a complete transformation of the surface.
    The opaque contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine, homogeneous substrate of the tempered
    glass. The surface now exhibits the characteristic smoothness of the manufactured material, with a measured roughness
    (Ra) returning to its intrinsic value of approximately 0.01 µm.


    The laser process has effectively ablated the contaminant film without inducing micro-fractures or thermal stress marks
    on the underlying glass. This is confirmed by the absence of the particulate agglomerates and the restoration of a continuous,
    optically clear surface. The cleaning threshold was carefully maintained below the material''s laser damage threshold
    of 10 J/cm² to preserve the glass''s structural integrity.


    The result is a surface defined by its intrinsic properties. The high transmissivity of 92% for visible light is restored,
    and the compressive surface layer, which gives tempered glass its tensile strength of 165 MPa, remains uncompromised.
    The surface is now suitable for high-precision applications in optics and electronics, where even microscopic contaminants
    can impair function.'
