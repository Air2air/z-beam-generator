caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tempered glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness, consists of embedded
    particulate matter, hydrocarbon films, and light oxide deposits. The contaminants
    create a topographically complex surface, masking the underlying glass's inherent
    smoothness of ~0.005 µm Ra. The particulate matter, including silica and carbonaceous
    soot, is mechanically bonded and scattered in irregular patterns, significantly
    increasing surface roughness and disrupting optical clarity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the
    pristine, intrinsic state of the tempered glass. The contamination layer has been
    completely removed via non-thermal ablation, exposing the original surface with
    a roughness of 0.005 µm Ra. The process has eliminated all particulate matter
    and thin films without inducing micro-fractures or altering the surface's compressive
    stress layer. This restoration results in a homogeneously smooth plane, restoring
    maximum light transmission and providing an ideal substrate for subsequent coatings
    or bonding processes.
