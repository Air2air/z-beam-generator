caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tempered glass surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous film, 2-5 µm thick, composed of organic residues
    and fine particulate matter, adheres to the substrate. This layer exhibits a mottled,
    textured topography that significantly diffuses transmitted light. Particulates,
    including sub-micron silica and carbonaceous soot, are embedded within the film,
    creating localized stress points. The underlying compressive stress layer of the
    glass is visually inaccessible, and the surface's inherent smoothness is entirely
    masked by this adherent, non-uniform coating.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine glass substrate. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the original, smooth surface with its characteristic
    compressive stress signature. At 500x, the surface is uniform and featureless,
    with no residual film or embedded particulates. This results in the restoration
    of maximum optical transmissivity (≥91%) and the elimination of light-scattering
    defects, returning the glass to its engineered state.
