        research_basis: Tempered glass (specifically soda-lime-silica glass) demonstrates
          exceptional resistance to most environmental corrosion agents including
          water, atmospheric gases, and common chemicals. The tempering process creates
          surface compression that further enhances durability. Glass maintains stability
          against oxidation, acid rain, and UV degradation. Rating reduced from 10
          due to susceptibility to strong alkaline solutions and hydrofluoric acid,
          which can cause surface etching over time.

          (Technical Materials Sheet)
        research_basis: Tempered glass, such as Gorilla Glass, is a type of chemically
          strengthened soda-lime glass. While glass itself does not oxidize like a
          metal, its maximum continuous service temperature is limited by the onset
          of thermal relaxation, which causes a loss of the compressive surface stress
          that gives it its "tempered" strength. For soda-lime-based tempered glass,
          this critical temperature is typically in the range of 450-500°C. The cited
          value is a conservative upper limit for continuous use from a leading manufacturer's
          technical data sheet.

        source: ASTM C1048, "Standard Specification for Heat-Strengthened and Fully
          Tempered Glass"
        research_basis: The flexural strength of tempered glass is well-documented
          in material standards and engineering references. ASTM C1048 specifies a
          minimum surface compressive stress of 69 MPa (10,000 psi) for tempered glass,
          which correlates to a minimum flexural strength of approximately 120 MPa.
          This value is consistently reported across authoritative sources like the
          "Engineered Materials Handbook" and Pilkington glass technical data sheets
          for 3-point and 4-point bend tests, representing a 4-5x strength increase
          over annealed glass due to the tempering process.

        source: ASTM C1048 "Standard Specification for Heat-Strengthened and Fully
          Tempered Glass"
        research_basis: Tempered glass compressive strength is substantially higher
          than its tensile strength due to induced surface compression. ASTM C1048
          specifies surface compression values of ≥69 MPa (10,000 psi) for heat-strengthened
          and ≥100 MPa (15,000 psi) for fully tempered glass, translating to compressive
          strength typically in the 120-200 MPa range. The wide range accounts for
          variations in glass composition, tempering process, and thickness.
