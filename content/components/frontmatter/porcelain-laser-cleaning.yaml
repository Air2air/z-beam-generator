caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the porcelain surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a tenacious film that fills the microscopic valleys
    of the porcelain''s inherent grain structure. The particulates, ranging from 2 to 20 micrometers in diameter, are embedded
    within an amorphous matrix, creating a topographically complex and occluded surface.


    The underlying porcelain texture is only partially visible where the film is thinnest. The contamination exhibits low
    reflectivity and a matte appearance at this scale, with visible cracking and delamination at the interface with the ceramic
    substrate in some regions. This indicates poor adhesion and the presence of subsurface penetration into the material''s
    minimal 2% porosity.'
  afterText: 'The laser cleaning process has resulted in a complete removal of the contamination layer, revealing the intrinsic
    porcelain substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic fine-grained, vitrified microstructure of the ceramic,
    with a uniform reflectivity that contrasts sharply with the previous matte, occluded state. The specific laser parameters,
    calibrated below the material''s 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, have ensured selective removal of contaminants without
    damaging the underlying matrix.


    Direct comparison shows the elimination of the 5-15 micrometer film and all embedded particulates. The laser''s interaction,
    governed by the porcelain''s 32.7 cm⁻¹ absorption coefficient, has effectively vaporized the contaminants. The original
    micro-topography of the porcelain is now fully exposed, with clean, well-defined grain boundaries and no evidence of the
    previous interfacial cracking or delamination.


    Analysis confirms the surface integrity is maintained, with no thermal cracking or melting observed. This indicates that
    the process parameters successfully leveraged the differential in thermal properties between the contamination and the
    porcelain itself, whose high thermal destruction point of 1650°C was not approached. The result is a substrate-defined
    surface, free from foreign material and restored to its original engineered state.'
