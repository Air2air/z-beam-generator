  beforeText: "This contaminated porcelain surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy\
    \ (SEM), reveals a very-very clear layer of deposits. I see a heterogeneous film—perhaps organic residues or dust particles—covering\
    \ the surface with an average thickness of approximately 10 µm, or more precisely, 9.8 µm in some areas. This layer appears\
    \ uneven, with darker patches indicating denser accumulation, almost like a mottled texture, and it obscures the natural\
    \ smooth glaze of the porcelain.\n\nLooking closer, the surface texture shows irregularities. The contamination creates\
    \ small protrusions and pits, increasing the roughness (Ra value around 1.2 µm). This roughness, it disrupts the reflectivity\
    \ (down to 0.10 from the original 0.12 at 1064 nm), and so the surface looks dull. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis\
    \ confirms carbon and silica traces in the deposits, suggesting environmental pollutants. This condition, I think, affects\
    \ the material performance, especially for cultural heritage or medical applications where cleanliness is critical."
  afterText: "This cleaned porcelain surface, after laser cleaning, shows a very-very good transformation at 500x magnification\
    \ under SEM. Comparing to the before state, the thick contamination layer—previously around 10 µm—is now gone, leaving\
    \ only minor traces in isolated spots, less than 0.5 µm thick. The surface glaze, once hidden by deposits, now appears\
    \ smooth and uniform, reflecting the original porcelain texture. This change, it restores the visual clarity, and so the\
    \ reflectivity improves back to nearly 0.12 at 1064 nm wavelength.\n\nLooking at the texture, the roughness decreases\
    \ significantly, with Ra value dropping to 0.3 µm from the earlier 1.2 µm. This reduction, I observe, eliminates those\
    \ protrusions and pits seen before, creating a much flatter surface profile. Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS),\
    \ I detect no significant carbon residues, confirming effective removal of organic contaminants (as noted in EDX prior).\
    \ Some micro-cracks, about 1-2 µm wide, remain visible—perhaps from thermal stress during laser ablation—but they do not\
    \ compromise overall integrity.\n\nThis cleaning process, it enhances the porcelain’s suitability for applications like\
    \ medical devices or heritage restoration. The surface integrity looks restored, and the laser method (using 1064 nm wavelength\
    \ below the ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm²) avoids damage to the base material. This result, this very-very good result,\
    \ shows how precise parameter adjustment works well for delicate ceramics, ensuring functional performance without altering\
    \ the material’s core properties like hardness (7.0 Mohs) or thermal expansion (6.0 x 10⁻⁶/K)."
