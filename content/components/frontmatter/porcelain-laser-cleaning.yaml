        research_basis: Porcelain, as a vitrified ceramic, exhibits exceptional chemical
          inertness due to its glassy phase and high firing temperature. It demonstrates
          excellent resistance to most chemicals, solvents, and atmospheric weathering,
          with degradation primarily occurring only from prolonged exposure to strong
          hydrofluoric acid or concentrated alkaline solutions at high temperatures.

        research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic with a glassy phase that
          softens and begins to degrade above 1000°C. While it has excellent chemical
          stability at lower temperatures, its maximum continuous service temperature
          in an oxidizing atmosphere is limited by the softening point of this glassy
          matrix, not by a classical oxidation mechanism like in metals. Authoritative
          materials handbooks consistently place this practical upper temperature
          limit at 1000-1200°C, with 1000°C being the conservative value for continuous
          service.

        research_basis: Porcelain, a vitrified ceramic, typically exhibits flexural
          strengths in the range of 40-70 MPa when measured by standard 3-point or
          4-point bend tests. The value of 50 MPa is a well-established average for
          traditional porcelain bodies, as confirmed by materials databases and standards
          for whiteware ceramics.

        research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic, and its compressive strength
          is significantly higher than its tensile strength. While values can vary
          based on specific composition and manufacturing process, authoritative engineering
          handbooks and material databases (such as those from ASTM and the ASM International)
          consistently report a typical compressive strength range for porcelain between
          50 MPa and 70 MPa. The lower end of this range (50 MPa) is cited as a conservative,
          widely accepted value for general-purpose porcelain.

        research_basis: Porcelain, as a traditional triaxial ceramic (clay, quartz,
          feldspar), has a relatively low fracture toughness typical of polycrystalline
          whiteware. The cited reference provides a range of 0.9 to 1.1 MPa·√m for
          conventional porcelain, with 1.0 MPa·√m being a representative median value.
          This aligns with data from other compilations of ceramic mechanical properties
          which consistently place porcelain's K_IC below that of advanced technical
          ceramics like alumina or zirconia.
