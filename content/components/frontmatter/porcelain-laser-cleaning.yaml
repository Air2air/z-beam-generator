subtitle: Pay close attention to porcelain’s fragile nature when starting laser treatment.
  It often shows micro-cracks under high power, so dial down to below 50 watts and
  adjust slowly for a very-very safe operation.

caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the porcelain surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex topography
    of particulate matter, organic residues, and micro-fractures. The underlying porcelain''s
    vitreous, high-density structure is partially visible only in isolated areas where
    the contaminant has delaminated, revealing the substrate''s intrinsic 7.0 Mohs
    hardness.


    The contamination adheres tenaciously within the microscopic surface porosity
    (<2.5%), creating a textured, matte appearance. This layer significantly alters
    the surface''s optical properties, increasing light scattering and reducing the
    inherent reflectivity of the glazed ceramic body. The contaminants fill the natural
    micro-valleys of the porcelain, masking its true surface morphology.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully removed the contamination layer, restoring
    the original porcelain substrate. The surface now displays a continuous, homogeneous
    vitreous phase with a reflectivity of approximately 12%. The inherent micro-topography,
    including minor polishing lines and the subtle grain structure from the firing
    process, is clearly defined and unobstructed.


    The process has successfully cleared all porosity and micro-fractures previously
    filled with foreign material. This results in a surface with minimal light scattering
    and restored optical clarity. The laser''s selective ablation has preserved the
    substrate''s structural integrity, leaving no thermal stress marks or subsurface
    damage visible at this magnification.'
