caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the ash surface is dominated by a discontinuous contamination layer averaging 15-25
    µm in thickness. This layer appears as a crust of fine particulate matter, primarily carbon soot and mineral dust, embedded
    within the porous structure of the ash. The high porosity (65%) of the underlying material creates a complex network of
    voids and fissures that are filled with these foreign particles, giving the surface a rough, occluded texture with a measured
    roughness (Ra) of approximately 15 µm.


    The contaminants form a dark, matte film that significantly obscures the natural grain and cellular structure of the ash
    substrate. Individual particles, ranging from sub-micron to 10 µm in size, are agglomerated into larger clusters. This
    layer exhibits low reflectivity (25% at 1064 nm), indicating its high absorption of laser energy. The combined effect
    is a surface that lacks definition, with its intrinsic features masked by the adhered particulate matter.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, revealing the underlying substrate with high fidelity. The
    porous, cellular architecture of the ash is now fully exposed, with the contamination layer completely removed from the
    surface and the pore networks. The process has restored the material''s natural topography without inducing macroscopic
    damage, such as melting or charring, to the delicate cell walls.


    The surface reflectivity has increased significantly due to the elimination of the light-absorbing contaminant film. This
    allows the intrinsic color and texture of the ash to be clearly observed. The measured surface roughness is now representative
    of the native wood ash structure, free from the added texture of particulate agglomerates. The cleaning has achieved selective
    ablation, precisely removing the contaminant layer which had a lower ablation threshold than the underlying ash material.'
