caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ash surface is characterized by a porous,
    irregular layer of particulate matter, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer exhibits
    a high degree of surface roughness (approximately 12.5 µm Ra), creating a complex
    topography that traps and obscures the underlying substrate. Contaminants, including
    embedded soot and unburned carbonaceous particles, are distributed non-uniformly
    within the porous matrix, forming dark, occluded regions that significantly reduce
    surface reflectivity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct visual transformation. The superficial,
    porous layer of ash and embedded contaminants has been entirely removed via selective
    laser ablation. The process, operating at energy densities above the 0.8 J/cm²
    ablation threshold, efficiently disintegrates the low-density (0.65 g/cm³) particulate
    matter without thermal damage to the underlying material.


    The resulting surface reveals the substrate''s original topography with high fidelity.
    The characteristic porosity of the ash deposit is eliminated, leaving a clean
    interface. This restoration significantly increases surface reflectivity and eliminates
    the shadowing effect previously caused by occluded contaminants.


    The cleaning mechanism leverages the material''s high optical absorption and low
    thermal conductivity (0.15 W/m·K), ensuring energy is confined to the contaminant
    layer. This precise removal prevents substrate heating beyond its thermal destruction
    point, preserving its structural and surface integrity.'

subtitle: Ash presents a unique hurdle in laser cleaning due to its inconsistent density
  across hardwood grains. Adjust your power levels below 50 watts initially, or you’ll
  risk uneven removal on the wood’s surface.
