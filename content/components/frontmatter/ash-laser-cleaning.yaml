        research_basis: Ash wood has moderate to low natural durability against decay
          fungi and insects. It's not resistant to moisture, rot, or environmental
          degradation without preservative treatment. While it has good mechanical
          properties, its heartwood is perishable and has limited resistance to wood-destroying
          organisms, placing it in the low durability category for corrosion/decay
          resistance.

        research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for wood is not a standard
          metric as it is for metals. For wood, the relevant property is the temperature
          at which significant thermal degradation begins. Authoritative sources like
          the USDA Wood Handbook indicate that prolonged exposure to temperatures
          above 150°C leads to significant pyrolysis, charring, and oxidative degradation
          for most wood species, including hardwoods like Ash. This temperature represents
          the maximum for continuous service before chemical decomposition accelerates.

        research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally
          recognized authority on wood properties. For the "White Ash" group, it lists
          a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 14,900 lbf/in², which converts to 103 MPa.
          This value is derived from standardized 3-point and 4-point bend tests on
          small, clear, straight-grained specimens.

        research_basis: The Wood Database compiles standardized test data from the
          USDA Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory and other authoritative sources.
          For white ash (Fraxinus americana), the compressive strength parallel to
          grain is consistently reported as 51 MPa at 12% moisture content, which
          is the standard condition for wood mechanical testing. This value aligns
          with the known high strength-to-weight ratio of ash among hardwoods.
