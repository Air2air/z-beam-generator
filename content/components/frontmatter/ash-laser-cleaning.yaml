subtitle: Ash has a unique, prominent grain structure with significant density variations. This requires careful laser parameter
  adjustments to clean the porous earlywood without damaging the denser latewood.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ash surface is obscured by a discontinuous, granular contamination layer measuring
    5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of soot, dust, and environmental particulates, adheres within the porous surface structure.
    The underlying wood grain and cellular detail are partially masked, creating a mottled, high-contrast topography that
    appears dark and textured.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the superficial contamination layer, revealing the intact, original ash substrate. The
    surface now exhibits a clearly defined, open-pore structure with distinct wood grain patterns. At 500x, the cellular anatomy
    is fully visible, showing a uniform, light-toned surface free from embedded particulates. The result is a return to the
    material's inherent, unadulterated texture.
