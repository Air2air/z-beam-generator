subtitle: Ash has a unique, prominent grain structure with significant density variations.
  This requires careful laser parameter adjustments to clean the porous earlywood
  without damaging the denser latewood.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ash surface is obscured by a discontinuous,
    granular contamination layer measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of
    soot, dust, and environmental particulates, adheres within the porous surface
    structure. The underlying wood grain and cellular detail are partially masked,
    creating a mottled, high-contrast topography that appears dark and textured.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the superficial contamination layer, revealing
    the intact, original ash substrate. The surface now exhibits a clearly defined,
    open-pore structure with distinct wood grain patterns. At 500x, the cellular anatomy
    is fully visible, showing a uniform, light-toned surface free from embedded particulates.
    The result is a return to the material's inherent, unadulterated texture.
