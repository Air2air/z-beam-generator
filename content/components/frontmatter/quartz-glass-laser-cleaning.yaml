caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the quartz glass surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    layer of particulate and film-based contamination. This layer, measuring 0.5–5
    µm in thickness, consists of sub-micron dust, skin oils, and process residues.
    These contaminants create a textured, matte topography that scatters light, significantly
    reducing the intrinsic 93% transmissivity of the pristine substrate. The underlying
    glass, with its characteristic 0.5 nm Ra polish, is no longer visible, compromising
    optical performance and surface energy.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification is restored
    to its native state. The contaminant layer has been completely removed via ablation,
    revealing the original polished quartz substrate with a surface roughness of approximately
    0.5 nm Ra. The surface is now continuous and featureless, with no evidence of
    micro-fractures or thermal damage, confirming the process operated below the material's
    2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. This restoration of atomic-level smoothness ensures
    optimal light transmission and chemical inertness, critical for high-performance
    applications.
