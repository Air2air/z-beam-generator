        research_basis: Quartz glass (fused silica) is documented by manufacturers
          like Corning and Heraeus as having "exceptional chemical purity and resistance,"
          being nearly inert to most acids, salts, and water. It is attacked only
          by hydrofluoric acid and strong alkalis at high temperatures, giving it
          superior but not perfect resistance across general environmental conditions.

        source: Heraeus Quarzglas, "Properties and Characteristics of Quartz Glass"
        research_basis: According to the leading manufacturer Heraeus, the maximum
          continuous service temperature for fused quartz in air is 1100°C. While
          quartz glass has excellent thermal stability, prolonged exposure above this
          temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere can lead to surface devitrification
          (crystallization), which is the primary oxidation-related degradation mechanism,
          rather than the formation of a gaseous oxide.

          and Glasses", Table 11.2 - Mechanical Properties of Commercial Glasses'
        research_basis: Quartz glass (fused silica) is a brittle ceramic material
          with typical flexural strength ranging from 30-70 MPa. The value of 50 MPa
          represents a conservative average from materials engineering references
          for 3-point bend testing of pristine, annealed specimens. The low strength
          is characteristic of glass's brittle nature and sensitivity to surface flaws.

          Doremus, Academic Press, 1986, p. 89.'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of fused quartz (quartz glass) is
          exceptionally high compared to its tensile strength. The cited authoritative
          handbook provides a typical value of 1.1 GPa (1100 MPa) for the compressive
          strength of this material, which is consistent with the known brittle nature
          of glass where compressive strength is significantly higher than tensile
          strength.
