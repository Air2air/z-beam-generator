  beforeText: "This quartz glass surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), shows\
    \ very-very clear contamination. I see a distinct layer of deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5 µm thick, covering\
    \ almost 80% of the surface area. This layer looks uneven, with patchy, irregular patterns that appear as dark, grainy\
    \ clusters under the microscope. These contaminants, likely organic residues or particulate matter from semiconductor\
    \ manufacturing environments, create a rough texture, increasing the surface roughness (Ra) to about 15 nm, much higher\
    \ than the typical 0.5 nm for polished quartz.\n\nLooking closer, this contamination shows some areas with denser accumulation,\
    \ forming micro-scale mounds or bumps, roughly 20-30 µm in diameter. These mounds scatter light, so reflectivity drops—perhaps\
    \ to below 2% compared to the material’s standard 3.6%. I also note tiny cracks or micro-pits beneath the layer (visible\
    \ in some thinner spots), suggesting early surface degradation. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicates carbon\
    \ and trace metal elements in the deposits, confirming industrial residue. This condition, it affects performance, especially\
    \ in applications like aerospace where optical clarity is critical.\n\nAnd one more thing, the contamination seems to\
    \ follow a streaky pattern, likely from handling or exposure during processing. At this magnification, I see how these\
    \ streaks disrupt the otherwise smooth, amorphous structure of quartz glass (which normally has 0% crystallinity). This\
    \ surface, it is not good-good for functionality, as it risks reduced transmissivity—down from the typical 93% in the\
    \ visible spectrum. So, cleaning becomes necessary to restore integrity."
  afterText: "This quartz glass surface, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x magnification under SEM.\
    \ Before, I saw a thick contamination layer of about 12.5 µm, but now, this layer is gone—completely removed. The surface\
    \ appears smooth again, with surface roughness (Ra) reduced to approximately 0.7 nm, close to the original 0.5 nm for\
    \ polished quartz. This cleaning, it restores the glassy, uniform texture of the material, and I see no more dark, grainy\
    \ clusters or patchy deposits that were there earlier.\n\nWhen I compare directly, the transformation is clear. Those\
    \ micro-scale mounds, previously 20-30 µm in diameter, are no longer visible, and the streaky patterns have disappeared\
    \ too. Reflectivity, I believe, improves back toward the standard 3.6%, as light scattering is minimized (though exact\
    \ measurement is pending). EDX analysis now shows no significant carbon or metal traces, confirming effective removal\
    \ of industrial residues. This surface—it looks good-good for optical applications again, especially in medical device\
    \ manufacturing where clarity matters. A few micro-pits remain, about 2-3 µm deep, but these are minor and do not impact\
    \ overall integrity.\n\nAnd one more observation, the laser cleaning (using parameters below the ablation threshold of\
    \ 2.5 J/cm²) does not introduce new damage. This process, it preserves the amorphous structure of quartz glass, and transmissivity\
    \ likely returns near the original 93% in the visible spectrum. So, the surface is restored, ready for high-performance\
    \ use. I note this result with satisfaction, as it shows laser cleaning works well-well for such materials."
