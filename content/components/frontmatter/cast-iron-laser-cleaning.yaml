subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its inconsistent graphite content,
  which can cause uneven cleaning. You'll need very-good power control to remove oxides
  without altering the underlying metal.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cast iron surface is obscured by a complex,
    multi-layered contamination matrix. A porous, amorphous carbon layer, approximately
    10-30 micrometers thick, forms the base, embedding fine abrasive silica particles
    (2-10 µm) from foundry sand. The surface topology is dominated by irregular, non-uniform
    oxide scales (Fe3O4, Fe2O3), which form brittle, crystalline structures that penetrate
    the metal's micro-pores. This composite layer completely masks the underlying
    metallic grain structure and graphite flakes, creating a rough, high-friction
    texture prone to initiating micro-cracks and corrosion.
  afterText: Laser cleaning selectively ablates the contamination matrix, revealing
    the true metallographic surface. The underlying pearlitic grain structure and
    the distinct, lamellar morphology of the graphite flakes are now fully exposed
    and sharply defined. The process removes all oxide scale and embedded particles,
    restoring the original micro-topography. This results in a clean, metallurgically
    pure surface with reduced microscopic roughness, which minimizes sites for corrosion
    initiation.
