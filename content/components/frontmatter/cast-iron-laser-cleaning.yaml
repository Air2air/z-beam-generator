subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its inconsistent graphite content,
  which can cause uneven cleaning. You'll need very-good power control to remove oxides
  without altering the underlying metal.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cast iron surface is obscured by a non-uniform,
    multi-layered contamination matrix. A porous, carbon-rich crust, approximately
    10-50 µm thick, forms the outermost layer, embedding fine particulate matter.
    Beneath this, a continuous oxide layer (mill scale) exhibits micro-cracking and
    spallation. The underlying metal's graphite flakes and microporosity are completely
    masked, with contamination filling surface valleys and creating a textured, high-relief
    topography.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination matrix, revealing the true
    metallographic structure of the cast iron substrate. The surface now displays
    a distinct contrast between the ferritic or pearlitic metal matrix and the exposed
    graphite flakes, which appear as dark, elongated particles uniformly distributed
    throughout the material. The original microporosity, inherent to the casting process,
    is also clearly visible as fine, dark voids.


    The removal of the 10-50 µm crust and oxide layers results in a significant reduction
    in surface roughness. The previous high-relief topography is replaced by a more
    uniform surface profile that corresponds directly to the underlying metal''s microstructure.
    The process eliminates the micro-cracks and spallation present in the mill scale,
    leaving a chemically pure, oxide-free surface.


    This cleaned state provides an optimal foundation for subsequent processes. The
    exposed, active metal surface enhances adhesion for coatings like paint or plating,
    while the removal of embedded particulate eliminates potential initiation sites
    for corrosion. The surface is now defined by its intrinsic metallurgical features
    rather than extrinsic contaminants.'
