subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its variable composition, which
  can cause inconsistent cleaning results. That's why a very-very specific power range
  must be established for each piece to ensure a uniform finish.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the surface is dominated by a non-uniform oxide
    layer (mill scale) measuring 50-150 micrometers thick. This brittle, crystalline
    layer exhibits extensive cracking and spalling, creating a porous, fragmented
    topography. Embedded within these fissures are pockets of carbonaceous soot and
    fine abrasive particulates, typically 5-20 micrometers in size. The underlying
    cast iron's characteristic graphite flake structure is completely obscured by
    this stratified, contaminated crust.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has removed the entire contamination layer, revealing
    the true metallographic surface of the cast iron. The mill scale, soot, and embedded
    particulates have been completely ablated, exposing the lamellar graphite flakes
    within the pearlitic iron matrix. This results in a distinct, high-contrast micro-topography.


    The process selectively removes contaminants without damaging the substrate. The
    surface now displays the material''s inherent micro-features, including the subtle
    porosity from the original casting process. The primary visual improvement is
    the restoration of the metal''s native texture and the elimination of the non-adherent,
    fractured oxide layer that characterized the initial state.'
