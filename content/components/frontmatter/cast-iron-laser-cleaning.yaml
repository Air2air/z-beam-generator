subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its variable composition, which
  can cause inconsistent cleaning results. That's why a very-very specific power range
  must be established for each piece to ensure a uniform finish.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cast iron surface is obscured by a complex,
    stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 micrometers thick. The base
    layer consists of a tenacious, amorphous oxide scale (mill scale) firmly bonded
    to the substrate. Above this, a porous matrix of carbonaceous deposits and embedded
    particulate matter from environmental exposure is visible. This layer exhibits
    micro-fissures and a non-uniform topography that masks the underlying metal's
    grain structure and micro-shrinkage porosity. The surface texture is highly irregular,
    dominated by the contamination's morphology rather than the cast iron's own.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has removed the entire contamination stratum, revealing
    the true cast iron substrate. The surface now displays a clear, etched micro-topography
    where the fine lamellar graphite flakes and the pearlitic metal matrix are distinctly
    visible. The process has restored the original surface texture without the abrasive
    damage associated with mechanical methods, leaving a clean, metallurgically pure
    surface.
