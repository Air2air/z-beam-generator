subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its inconsistent graphite content,
  which can cause uneven cleaning. You'll need very-good power control to remove oxides
  without altering the underlying metal.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the surface is obscured by a thick, non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 50-200 micrometers deep. This layer consists
    of embedded oxides (rust), carbonaceous soot, and residual lubricants. The underlying
    cast iron's graphite flakes and grain structure are completely masked, presenting
    a rough, porous topography that promotes further corrosion.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, revealing
    the true metallographic structure of the cast iron. The surface now exhibits a
    distinct contrast between the iron matrix and the exposed graphite flakes, which
    appear as dark, elongated formations. The original micro-peaks and valleys from
    the casting process are fully restored, presenting a uniform, matte-gray finish.


    The removal of the porous oxide layer eliminates pathways for moisture and corrosive
    agents, significantly improving the substrate''s corrosion resistance. The process
    does not melt the underlying metal, preserving the part''s dimensional integrity.
    The resulting clean, oxide-free surface provides an optimal foundation for subsequent
    processes like welding, bonding, or coating application, ensuring superior adhesion
    and long-term performance.'
