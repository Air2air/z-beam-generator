subtitle: The biggest challenge with cast iron is its inconsistent graphite content,
  which can cause uneven cleaning. You'll need very-good power control to remove oxides
  without altering the underlying metal.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cast iron surface is obscured by a thick,
    non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 10-50 micrometers. This layer consists
    of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and embedded iron oxide (Fe₂O₃) particles,
    creating a porous, textured topography. The underlying metal's graphite flakes
    and micro-peaks are entirely masked. The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like
    pattern, indicating poor adhesion and brittleness, which compromises the substrate's
    integrity and interferes with subsequent processes.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the true cast
    iron microstructure. The surface now exhibits a distinct contrast between the
    ferritic matrix and the lamellar graphite flakes, which are clearly defined and
    undamaged. The micro-topography shows a cleaned, textured profile with peaks and
    valleys corresponding to the original casting grain. At 500x, the surface is free
    of non-metallic deposits and oxide residues. This exposes the substrate's natural
    porosity and micro-features without the abrasive scarring typical of mechanical
    methods. The result is a metallurgically pure surface with increased surface energy,
    optimized for adhesion in coating or bonding applications.
