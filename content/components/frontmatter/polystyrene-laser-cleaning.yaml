caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polystyrene surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a particulate
    and film-like morphology, with agglomerates adhering to the substrate's native
    0.1 µm Ra texture. The contaminants disrupt the underlying polymer topography,
    creating a matte, occluded appearance that masks the material's intrinsic optical
    clarity and compromises interfacial properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine polystyrene substrate. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the original polymer surface with its characteristic
    0.1 µm Ra micro-texture. The surface is now continuous and defect-free, with no
    evidence of thermal degradation, melting, or ablation of the base polymer. This
    results in optimal optical transmission and a chemically pure interface.
