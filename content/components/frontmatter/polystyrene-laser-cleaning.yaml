caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polystyrene surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a particulate and film-like morphology, with agglomerates distorting the underlying substrate's topography. The native surface roughness of approximately 0.1 µm Ra is entirely masked, creating a textured, high-relief profile that scatters light and compromises the material's intrinsic optical clarity and adhesion properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, restoring the substrate''s native amorphous polymer structure. The 5-15 µm contamination layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation. The process successfully vaporized the foreign material, which has a lower ablation threshold than the polystyrene, without initiating thermal degradation in the base polymer.


    The underlying polystyrene surface is now fully exposed, revealing its characteristic smooth morphology with a measured roughness of 0.1 µm Ra. The surface is free of the previous particulate agglomerates and film residues. At the micron scale, the laser interaction preserves the polymer''s integrity, with no evidence of melting, cracking, or surface oxidation that would indicate thermal damage.


    This precise material removal results in a surface with restored optical properties and chemical functionality. The reflectivity and clarity inherent to the pristine polymer are recovered, providing an optimal surface for subsequent manufacturing steps such as bonding, coating, or assembly in sensitive applications.'
