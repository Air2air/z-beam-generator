caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polystyrene surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contaminant layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and particulate matter, adheres to the native surface texture, which
    has a baseline roughness of 0.8 µm Ra. The contaminants form a webbed pattern,
    filling the microscopic valleys of the polymer and creating a topographically
    uneven, matte-finish surface that scatters light and masks the substrate's intrinsic
    properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contaminant layer, revealing
    the pristine polystyrene substrate. The surface now exhibits its intrinsic molded
    texture with a consistent 0.8 µm Ra roughness, free from any foreign material.
    The cleaning process has restored optical clarity and surface uniformity without
    inducing melting or ablation, as the laser fluence was maintained below the material's
    0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold. This precise removal of contaminants has reinstated
    the polymer's original surface energy and reflectivity of 4.2%, ensuring optimal
    performance for subsequent manufacturing steps like bonding or coating. The transformation
    is defined by the restoration of the base material's properties.

subtitle: Polystyrene often presents a subtle challenge during laser treatment, as
  its surface can warp under excessive heat. Pay close attention to power adjustments,
  ideally staying below 50 watts, to safeguard its delicate finish.
