description: Technical overview of Schist, a metamorphic rock predominantly composed
  of mica, quartz, and feldspar, for laser cleaning. The laser cleaning process for
  Schist involves the use of a 1064nm wavelength laser with a fluence range of 1.0-10
  J/cm², allowing for the precise removal of contaminants while preserving the integrity
  of the Schist surface. This method is particularly suitable for applications in
  construction and heritage conservation, where the restoration and cleaning of Schist
  surfaces are crucial without causing thermal damage.
