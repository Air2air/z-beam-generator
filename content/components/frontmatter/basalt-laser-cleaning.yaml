caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated basalt surface is characterized by a discontinuous layer of particulate
    and biological matter. A primary feature is a sooty, carbonaceous deposit, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick, which
    fills the natural micro-fractures and vesicles of the stone. This layer exhibits low adhesion, appearing as a loosely-bound,
    amorphous film that obscures the underlying mineralogy.


    The surface texture is further complicated by patches of cryptogamic growth, where fungal hyphae and microbial biofilms
    have established a tenacious, web-like structure across the substrate. These biological colonies penetrate the stone''s
    micro-porosity (typically 1.5%), creating a complex, multi-layered contamination system. The original, fine-grained interlocking
    crystals of plagioclase and pyroxene are largely hidden, with only the highest topographic peaks remaining partially visible
    through the overlying deposits.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the superficial contamination layer, fully exposing the original basalt
    substrate. The stone's intrinsic micro-texture is now clearly visible, revealing a clean, interlocking matrix of fine-grained
    plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. The previously obscured vesicles and micro-fractures are now open and free of particulate
    fill, restoring the surface's natural porosity and mineralogical detail without thermal alteration to the primary structure.
