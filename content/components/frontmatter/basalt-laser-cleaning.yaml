caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the basalt surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 10-50 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    embedded particulate matter, such as silica dust and metallic oxides, within a
    matrix of carbonaceous soot and hydrocarbon deposits. The underlying basalt's
    micro-crystalline texture, characterized by interlocking plagioclase and pyroxene
    crystals, is entirely masked. The contaminants fill the natural micro-fissures
    and pores of the stone, creating a discontinuous, matte-black coating that compromises
    the substrate's inherent properties.
  after_text: Laser cleaning has restored the pristine mineralogical surface. The
    superficial contamination layer has been completely ablated, revealing the intact,
    interlocking crystal structure of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene. The process
    has effectively cleared all micro-fissures and pores, with no observable thermal
    damage such as melting or micro-fracturing to the underlying basalt, which has
    a compressive strength of 200 MPa. The surface now exhibits its natural micro-roughness
    and mineralogical contrast. The high optical absorption coefficient of basalt
    (0.85) allowed for efficient contaminant removal at energy densities just above
    the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring a selective process that preserved
    the substrate. The result is a clean, well-defined interface between the different
    mineral phases.
