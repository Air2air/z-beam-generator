caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the basalt surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer, composed
    of carbonaceous soot, industrial particulates, and embedded salts, fills the natural
    micro-fractures and vesicles of the stone. The underlying crystalline matrix of
    plagioclase and pyroxene is largely hidden, with contamination adhering strongly
    to the rough, porous surface texture, creating a matte, occluded appearance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic basalt surface. At 500x magnification,
    the contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the unaltered mineral microstructure.
    The sharp boundaries of plagioclase laths and pyroxene grains are now fully visible,
    with micro-fractures and vesicles cleared of debris. The surface exhibits its
    native micro-roughness and a consistent, clean substrate.
