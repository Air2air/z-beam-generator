caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the basalt surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A discontinuous, carbonaceous crust, measuring 10-50 µm thick, adheres
    to the mineral matrix. This layer, composed of soot, salts, and organic matter,
    fills the natural micro-fractures and vesicles inherent to the stone. The underlying
    feldspar and pyroxene crystals are partially visible, but their sharp, interlocking
    texture is muted. The contamination exhibits a dendritic, branching pattern, exploiting
    the basalt's low 1.5% porosity for anchorage, which compromises the stone's intrinsic
    high chemical stability and creates a rough, uneven topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the pristine mineralogical surface. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed, revealing the unaltered, interlocking crystal
    structure of the feldspar and pyroxene grains. The original micro-fractures and
    vesicles are now clean and open, with sharp, well-defined edges. The surface topography
    is uniform, with the inherent hardness (6.0 Mohs) and density of the basalt fully
    exposed, resulting in a visually coherent and texturally intact substrate.
