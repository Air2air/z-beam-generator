subtitle: Basalt is a dense, fine-grained igneous stone that can vary in hardness
  and mineral composition. These variations require careful adjustment of laser settings
  to effectively remove contaminants without damaging the surface.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the basalt surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer. A carbonaceous soot and particulate matrix, approximately 10-50 micrometers
    thick, adheres tenaciously to the stone's micro-texture. This layer infiltrates
    the natural micro-fractures and vesicles inherent to the basalt, creating a deep-seated,
    interlocked bond. The underlying crystalline structure of the feldspar and pyroxene
    minerals is completely masked. The contaminant's low reflectivity results in a
    visually homogeneous, matte black appearance that obscures the stone's intrinsic
    granularity and color variation.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the basalt to its intrinsic mineralogical
    state. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, revealing a clean, well-defined
    grain boundary network between the feldspar and pyroxene crystals. The surface
    now exhibits its natural micro-roughness and the distinct geometries of individual
    mineral grains. The process has effectively cleared the vesicles and micro-fractures,
    eliminating the binding points for contaminants. This results in a surface with
    higher light reflectivity, showcasing the material's authentic texture and subtle
    color gradations.
