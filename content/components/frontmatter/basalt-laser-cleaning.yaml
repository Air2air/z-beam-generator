caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the basalt surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    soot, mineral dust, and biological growth, fills the natural micro-fractures and
    vesicles characteristic of the stone. The original crystalline texture of the
    plagioclase and pyroxene minerals is entirely masked. The contaminant forms a
    cohesive, low-porosity crust that compromises the substrate's permeability and
    adhesion for any subsequent treatments.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the contamination layer, revealing the
    pristine mineral microstructure. The original interlocking crystals of plagioclase
    and pyroxene are now clearly defined, with sharp boundaries and micro-vesicles
    free of particulate matter. The surface exhibits its inherent micro-roughness
    and porosity without thermal damage or alteration to the mineral phases. The substrate's
    natural absorption coefficient and reflectivity have been restored.
