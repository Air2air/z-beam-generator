caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GaAs surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 1-5 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, hydrocarbon films, and adsorbed moisture, creating a textured, matte appearance. The contaminants scatter light and mask the underlying crystalline structure, forming irregular patterns of residue that compromise surface integrity and interfere with subsequent processing steps. The native substrate is not visible through this film.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a dramatic transformation. The contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, monolithic GaAs crystal. At 500x, the surface is now continuous and smooth, with the material's inherent granularity from its zinc blende structure clearly visible. Laser parameters are tuned to remain below the 0.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring no phase change or subsurface damage. This results in an atomically clean surface with restored optical and electronic properties.
