caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GaAs surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 0.5-2 µm thick. Particulate matter and hydrocarbon
    films create a textured, irregular topography. This layer disrupts the underlying
    crystalline structure, scattering light and masking the substrate's intrinsic
    semiconductor properties, which degrades electronic performance.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, atomic-level
    structure of the Zinc Blende crystal lattice. The contamination layer is completely
    removed, exposing a smooth, defect-free plane with sub-micrometer uniformity.
    This restoration of the intrinsic surface ensures optimal electrical characteristics
    and minimal optical scattering for high-performance applications.
