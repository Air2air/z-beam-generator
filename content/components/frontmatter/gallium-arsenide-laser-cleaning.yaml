caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the gallium arsenide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    2-5 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a textured, amorphous film with scattered particulate matter embedded throughout.
    The underlying crystalline structure of the GaAs is completely hidden beneath this contamination.


    The surface exhibits irregular staining patterns with visible organic residues forming web-like networks across the inspection
    area. Particulate contaminants ranging from 10-50 micrometers in diameter are randomly distributed, creating localized
    topographic variations. The overall appearance is matte and diffuse, with no reflective properties characteristic of pristine
    semiconductor material visible at this magnification.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The previously opaque contamination
    layer has been completely removed, revealing the underlying GaAs substrate with its characteristic reflective surface.
    The zinc blende crystalline structure is now visible as a consistent, patterned topography across the entire inspection
    area.


    The surface exhibits a uniform morphology with the laser-processed regions showing minimal residual particulate matter.
    The cleaning process has restored the material''s inherent reflectivity, with light reflecting cleanly from the surface
    rather than scattering through a contamination layer. The previously observed staining patterns and embedded particles
    have been eliminated without introducing visible micro-cracks or thermal damage to the GaAs substrate.


    Analysis confirms the laser parameters were carefully controlled to remain below the material''s ablation threshold of
    0.15 J/cm², ensuring selective removal of contaminants while preserving the semiconductor''s structural integrity. The
    surface now displays the smooth, continuous appearance expected of high-purity gallium arsenide, with only occasional
    sub-micrometer scale features remaining from the cleaning process.'
