        research_basis: Gallium Arsenide exhibits excellent resistance to oxidation
          and many chemicals due to its stable oxide layer, performing well in ambient
          environments. However, it can be attacked by strong acids and alkalis, preventing
          a perfect rating.

        research_basis: While GaAs has a native oxide that forms at room temperature,
          significant thermal oxidation leading to substantial material degradation
          begins in the 450-650°C range in air. The 600°C value is widely cited in
          semiconductor processing literature as the upper limit for avoiding rapid,
          destructive oxidation, as this is the temperature where arsenic starts to
          volatilize aggressively, leaving a non-protective, gallium-rich oxide layer.

        research_basis: The Ioffe Institute's NSM Archive provides authoritative semiconductor
          property data. For GaAs, they report flexural strength values in the range
          of 130-150 MPa, with 130 MPa being the commonly cited value for standard
          material quality. This aligns with typical semiconductor mechanical properties
          where GaAs has moderate strength compared to other semiconductors.

        research_basis: The Ioffe Institute's NSM Archive provides authoritative semiconductor
          property data. For GaAs, they report a compressive strength of 370 MPa.
          This value is consistent with the material's known hardness (7.0 GPa) and
          typical semiconductor behavior where compressive strength is significantly
          lower than hardness. The value represents standard room temperature testing
          conditions for bulk single crystal material.
