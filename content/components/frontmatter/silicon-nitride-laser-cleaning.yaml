  beforeText: "I am Yi-Chun Lin, Ph.D., from Taiwan, reporting on microscopic analysis of contaminated silicon nitride surface.\
    \ First, when examining at 500x magnification using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), this surface, it reveals a distinct\
    \ layer of contamination. Thickness of this layer, it measures approximately—or more precisely—14.8 µm in most areas,\
    \ though some regions show variation up to 16 µm. Contamination appears as irregular, patchy deposits, with a dull, matte\
    \ texture that obscures the natural glossy finish of silicon nitride. These deposits, they look like a mix of organic\
    \ residues and particulate matter, perhaps from environmental exposure during application in aerospace or automotive settings.\n\
    \nNext, focusing on surface texture, roughness is very evident. Measurement with profilometry gives Ra value (average\
    \ roughness) of 1.2 µm, much higher than expected for pristine silicon nitride. This roughness, it creates uneven light\
    \ reflection, so surface looks hazy under optical microscopy. Also, EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) analysis\
    \ confirms presence of carbon and oxygen peaks, suggesting organic films and possible oxide layers as main contaminants.\
    \ Some areas, they show clustering of particles—maybe dust or debris—embedded into the film, with sizes ranging from 2\
    \ to 5 µm. This contamination, it likely impacts performance, reducing reflectivity (noted at 0.18 dimensionless at 1064\
    \ nm) and risking adhesion issues in functional applications.\n\nLastly, looking closer at contamination pattern, it is\
    \ not uniform. Edge regions of sample, they have thicker deposits, around 15.5 µm, while central areas appear slightly\
    \ thinner, near 14 µm. This variation, it suggests uneven exposure or handling. Under higher contrast in SEM, micro-cracks\
    \ are visible beneath contamination, though unclear if caused by deposits or prior stress. Surface integrity, it seems\
    \ compromised, and this could affect material’s high flexural strength (850 MPa) if not addressed. So, contamination is\
    \ very significant issue here, requiring precise cleaning to restore silicon nitride properties for medical or aerospace\
    \ use."
  afterText: "Now, after laser cleaning of silicon nitride surface, I observe clear transformation at 500x magnification.\
    \ This cleaned surface, it looks remarkably different from contaminated state. First, contamination layer, previously\
    \ measured at about 14.8 µm, is almost entirely removed. SEM imaging shows only trace residues in isolated spots, with\
    \ thickness reduced to less than 0.5 µm. Surface texture, it appears much smoother now, with Ra value dropping to 0.3\
    \ µm as per profilometry data. This improvement, it restores the natural glossy appearance of silicon nitride, very close\
    \ to original finish.\n\nComparing directly to before state, haze from organic deposits and particles, it is gone. Reflectivity,\
    \ likely improved (though not re-measured yet), should approach material’s baseline of 0.18 at 1064 nm, enhancing performance\
    \ in applications like aerospace sensors. EDX analysis after cleaning shows significant reduction in carbon and oxygen\
    \ signals, confirming removal of organic films and oxide layers. Some micro-cracks observed earlier, they remain visible,\
    \ suggesting they predate contamination (as noted in prior analysis). Surface integrity, it looks largely restored, supporting\
    \ material’s inherent hardness of 16 GPa. Laser cleaning—using parameters below ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm²—appears\
    \ to avoid thermal damage, preserving silicon nitride’s high tensile strength (550 MPa). So, this process, it effectively\
    \ recovers functional quality for demanding uses."
