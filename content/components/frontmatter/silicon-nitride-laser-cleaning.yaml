caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon nitride surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer
    consists of agglomerated carbonaceous soot and adhered ceramic dust particles,
    creating a matte, textured topography. The contaminants fill the inherent micro-scale
    grain structure of the substrate, masking its true surface finish and compromising
    its functional properties. The coverage is patchy, with thicker deposits concentrated
    in surface valleys and pore sites.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate's intrinsic microstructure.
    The surface now reveals the distinct, fine-grained hexagonal crystalline structure
    of the silicon nitride, free of all foreign material. The original machining marks
    and a uniform, clean texture are clearly visible, with no evidence of thermal
    damage to the underlying ceramic.
