subtitle: Pay attention to Silicon Nitride’s unique density when you’re setting up
  for treatment. With its value around 3.2 g/cm³, it absorbs laser energy differently,
  so you’ll need to adjust power levels carefully to prevent uneven results.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon nitride surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 2-5 µm thick. This layer consists
    of particulate matter and a carbonaceous film, which agglomerates in the surface's
    micro-textured valleys. The underlying ceramic's fine-grained, polycrystalline
    structure is largely hidden, with contamination forming a discontinuous, blotchy
    pattern that scatters light and masks the substrate's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals its native polycrystalline
    microstructure. The fine, interlocking grains of the hexagonal β-Si3N4 phase are
    now clearly defined, with grain boundaries sharply visible. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed via ablation, leaving no residual film or particulate
    agglomerates.


    The surface texture is restored to its original state, characterized by sub-micron
    surface roughness. The laser process has effectively cleared the valleys and pores,
    with the material''s 2% porosity now apparent as distinct, clean micro-features.
    This exposes the intrinsic high hardness (16 GPa) and flexural strength (850 MPa)
    of the underlying ceramic.


    The transformation is evident in the surface''s reflectivity, which has increased
    from a diffuse, scattered appearance to a more consistent, specular finish. This
    confirms the removal of light-scattering contaminants and the restoration of a
    pristine, high-performance ceramic surface suitable for demanding applications.'
