caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon nitride surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    2-5 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a discontinuous film of carbonaceous soot and particulate matter, characterized
    by a matte, dark gray appearance that significantly reduces surface reflectivity. The contaminants form agglomerates ranging
    from 5 to 20 micrometers in diameter, creating a textured, topographically complex landscape that masks the underlying
    ceramic''s intrinsic microstructure.


    The contamination adheres to the surface in a patchy, irregular pattern, with some areas showing thicker accumulation
    in micro-cracks and surface pores. Fine particulate matter, likely sub-micrometer in size, is embedded within the larger
    agglomerates, creating a multi-scale roughness. This layer completely conceals the native grain structure and surface
    finish of the silicon nitride substrate, presenting a visually heterogeneous and occluded surface to the observer.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is immediately apparent at 500x magnification. The previously
    opaque contamination layer has been completely removed, revealing the underlying silicon nitride''s fine-grained polycrystalline
    structure. The surface now exhibits its characteristic light gray hue and a uniform, matte ceramic finish, with reflectivity
    restored to its intrinsic level of approximately 42%.


    The cleaning process has exposed the material''s native microstructure without inducing surface damage. The interlocking
    beta-silicon nitride grains, typically 0.5-2.0 micrometers in size, are now clearly visible and well-defined. No thermal
    cracking, melting, or ablation pits are observed, confirming the laser parameters remained below the material''s damage
    threshold of 15 J/cm². The surface porosity appears clean and open, with no residual contamination visible within the
    pore structures, resulting in a topographically consistent and homogenous surface.'
