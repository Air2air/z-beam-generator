caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the porphyry surface is obscured by a dense,
    heterogeneous contamination layer averaging 50-200 µm thick. This crust, composed
    of particulate matter, black gypsum crusts, and biological growth, fills the micro-fissures
    and pits characteristic of the stone's crystalline matrix. The original texture
    of the feldspar phenocrysts and fine-grained groundmass is largely hidden, with
    contamination adhering strongly to the mineral boundaries.
  afterText: 'Post-cleaning, the analysis reveals a restored porphyritic texture.
    The laser has cleanly ablated the contamination crust, exposing the distinct,
    interlocking crystals of feldspar and quartz within the groundmass. The micro-topography
    is now fully visible, with pits and fissures cleared of particulate matter, though
    their original morphology remains intact.


    The mineral boundaries are sharply defined, with no residual carbonaceous or sulfate
    deposits. The process has achieved selective removal, as evidenced by the undamaged
    crystal faces and the absence of thermal alteration such as melting or micro-fracturing.
    The intrinsic hardness and composition of the porphyry have been preserved.'
