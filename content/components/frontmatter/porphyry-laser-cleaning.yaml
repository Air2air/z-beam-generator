caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the porphyry surface is obscured by a complex, stratified contamination layer. A dark, carbonaceous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres tenaciously to the stone matrix. This crust, composed of soot, hydrocarbons, and gypsum, fills the micro-porosity and blankets the distinct phenocrysts of quartz and feldspar.


    Beneath this crust, a sub-layer of biological growth, including fungal hyphae and cyanobacteria, penetrates the stone''s natural micropores (approx. 1.2% porosity). The contamination creates a uniform, matte-black topography that completely masks the inherent mineralogical contrast and micro-fracture network of the underlying porphyry, compromising its visual and material integrity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete restoration of the porphyry''s intrinsic microstructure. The contamination crust has been selectively ablated, exposing the clean, unaltered matrix. The sharp geometric boundaries of quartz and feldspar phenocrysts are now clearly defined against the finer-grained groundmass.


    The stone''s natural micro-fracture network and original surface texture are fully visible, with no residual soiling within the pores. The laser process has successfully removed the biological sub-layer without inducing thermal damage, such as melting or micro-fissuring, to the primary minerals. The surface exhibits its native hardness and reflectivity.'
