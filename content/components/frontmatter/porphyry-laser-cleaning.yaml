        research_basis: Porphyry is an igneous rock with high quartz content (SiO₂
          >65%) and a dense, interlocking crystalline structure, making it highly
          resistant to chemical weathering and environmental corrosion. It is classified
          as a high-strength, durable dimension stone comparable to granite. Its performance
          in harsh environmental conditions and historical use in paving and monuments
          supports this high corrosion resistance rating, though it is slightly less
          resistant than some denser granites or quartzites.

          Rocks'
        research_basis: Porphyry is a textural term for igneous rocks, typically with
          a feldspar or quartz-feldspar groundmass. Authoritative geological guides
          (BGS) classify common igneous rocks like granite and andesite (which encompass
          most porphyries) as having a maximum service temperature of 600°C in air
          before significant mineral decomposition and oxidation begin, primarily
          due to the oxidation of iron minerals and thermal breakdown of feldspars.
          This is a conservative estimate for the porphyry category.

        research_basis: The provided source compiles technical data from multiple
          international testing laboratories and standards (ASTM, EN). It reports
          a typical flexural strength range for porphyry of 10-20 MPa, with 15 MPa
          being a commonly cited average value for design purposes, typically determined
          via a 4-point bend test.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of Porphyry is highly variable, ranging
          from approximately 150 MPa to over 250 MPa depending on its specific mineral
          composition and quarry source. The provided value is a conservative average
          based on industry-standard testing (ASTM C170) of saturated specimens, as
          reported by authoritative stone industry guides. The listed material properties
          (high density and hardness) are consistent with a rock possessing high compressive
          strength.
