caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the porphyry surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous soiling
    matrix, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick, adheres to the substrate. This layer consists of fine particulate matter
    embedded within a carbonaceous film, which fills the natural micro-fissures and pits of the stone''s surface.


    The underlying porphyritic texture, characterized by its distinct phenocrysts (larger crystals) within a finer-grained
    groundmass, is partially masked. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion in some areas, forming a cracked, crust-like
    morphology that bridges surface features. This layer significantly alters the surface''s original micro-topography, creating
    a uniform, matte appearance that obscures the natural mineralogical contrast and surface reflectivity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the original porphyry microstructure.
    The contamination layer has been entirely removed, with no residual carbonaceous film or particulate matter observed.
    The surface now exposes the full, unaltered porphyritic texture.


    The sharp geometric boundaries of the phenocrysts and the intricate details of the groundmass are fully visible, restoring
    the natural micro-relief. The laser process has effectively cleared all occlusions from the micro-fissures without inducing
    micro-fracturing or thermal alteration to the mineral constituents. The surface reflectivity and inherent mineralogical
    contrast have been returned to their native state.'
