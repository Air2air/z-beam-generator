caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated MMC surface shows a non-uniform
    layer of carbonaceous and oxide deposits, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick. This
    contamination layer appears as a dark, amorphous crust with a rough, textured
    morphology that obscures the underlying composite structure. The surface exhibits
    a mottled pattern with visible cracking and spallation, where sections of the
    deposit have partially detached from the metal matrix.


    The contamination layer completely masks the characteristic particulate reinforcement
    structure of the MMC. The surface roughness has increased significantly from the
    base material''s 0.8 μm Ra to approximately 3.5 μm Ra due to the uneven deposit
    accumulation. The layer shows poor adhesion in multiple regions, with visible
    interfacial gaps between the contamination and the composite substrate.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is immediately
    apparent at 500x magnification. The dark, amorphous contamination layer has been
    completely removed, revealing the underlying metal matrix composite structure.
    The characteristic silicon carbide reinforcement particles are now clearly visible,
    uniformly distributed throughout the aluminum matrix, with their angular geometry
    and typical 10-20 micrometer size range readily observable.


    The surface roughness has been restored to near-original conditions, measuring
    approximately 0.9 μm Ra compared to the pre-cleaning value of 3.5 μm Ra. The laser
    process has selectively removed the contamination without significant alteration
    to the composite microstructure. The interface between the ceramic reinforcement
    particles and the metal matrix remains intact, with no evidence of thermal damage,
    delamination, or particle dislodgment.


    Analysis confirms the laser parameters were optimized for the MMC''s material
    properties, utilizing the differential absorption between the contamination layer
    and the composite substrate. The cleaned surface shows no residual contamination
    in the interfacial regions between particles and matrix, and the original surface
    porosity of approximately 1.2% is maintained. This thorough cleaning establishes
    an optimal surface condition for subsequent processing or bonding operations.'
