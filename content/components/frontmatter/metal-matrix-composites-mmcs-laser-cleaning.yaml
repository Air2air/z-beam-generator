        confidence: 0.85
        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, "Corrosion of Metal-Matrix Composites"'
        research_basis: MMCs typically have poor to fair corrosion resistance (2-4/10)
          due to galvanic coupling between the conductive reinforcement (e.g., ceramics
          like SiC) and the metal matrix, creating preferential corrosion sites. While
          specific ratings vary by matrix/reinforcement combination, general environmental
          corrosion resistance is significantly compromised compared to the monolithic
          base metal.

        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, "Metal-Matrix Composites"'
        research_basis: The oxidation resistance of MMCs is not a single value but
          is highly dependent on the specific matrix alloy (e.g., aluminum, titanium,
          magnesium) and the reinforcement. For the most common class, Aluminum Matrix
          Composites (AMCs), which align with the provided density, the maximum continuous
          service temperature in air is typically limited to 300-450°C. This upper
          limit is due to the rapid degradation of the aluminum matrix and the potential
          for accelerated oxidation at reinforcement/matrix interfaces. The cited
          ASM Handbook provides this range for high-performance AMCs, with 450°C representing
          a practical upper bound before significant oxidation and property loss occur.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a common class of MMCs like aluminum matrix composites reinforced with
          silicon carbide (SiC). For a typical Al/SiC MMC with ~20-30% reinforcement,
          the compressive strength is often in the range of 300-400 MPa, with 350
          MPa being a representative mid-range value. The hardness of 55 HRB further
          supports this strength range for a discontinuously reinforced MMC.
