caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the MMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    abrasive particles from machining, intermixed with hydrocarbon-based lubricants
    and oxides. The contaminants form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern that masks
    the underlying composite microstructure.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with agglomerated deposits filling the
    valleys between reinforcement particles. This creates a smeared, matte appearance
    that significantly reduces surface reflectivity. The contamination layer adheres
    tenaciously to both the aluminum matrix and the silicon carbide reinforcements,
    creating a barrier that compromises the performance of any subsequent coating
    or bonding process.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine MMC microstructure. The aluminum
    matrix now appears as a continuous, lightly textured phase, while the silicon
    carbide reinforcement particles are clearly exposed and uniformly distributed.
    The surface exhibits a consistent, clean metallic luster with a measured roughness
    of approximately 1.2 µm Ra. All foreign material has been selectively ablated
    without damaging the underlying composite.
