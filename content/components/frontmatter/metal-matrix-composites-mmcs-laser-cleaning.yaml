caption:
  beforeText: "This surface of Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) shows very-very clear contamination when observed at 500x magnification\
    \ under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Through the lens, I see a thick, uneven layer of deposits—perhaps organic\
    \ residues or oxide films—covering the aluminum matrix and SiC reinforcement particles. This layer measures approximately\
    \ 8–10 µm in thickness, and it looks patchy with darker, irregular spots scattered across the surface. The texture appears\
    \ rough, much higher than the typical 1.2 µm Ra (surface roughness average), maybe closer to 3.5 µm Ra due to these contaminants\
    \ sticking unevenly.  \n\nThis contamination hides the natural metallic sheen of the aluminum matrix, making the surface\
    \ look dull and mottled. At this magnification, I also notice micro-cracks—very tiny, about 2 µm wide—near the reinforcement\
    \ interfaces, possibly from trapped debris or stress during processing. Using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX),\
    \ the analysis shows high carbon and oxygen peaks, confirming organic and oxide layers. So, this dirty surface likely\
    \ affects performance, reducing reflectivity (normally 0.35 dimensionless) and risking poor adhesion or thermal conductivity\
    \ (rated at 180 W/m·K). This condition is not good, not good at all for aerospace or automotive applications."
  afterText: "This cleaned surface of Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs), after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x\
    \ magnification under SEM. Before, the surface had a thick 8–10 µm contamination layer, but now, this layer is gone—or\
    \ more precisely—reduced to less than 1 µm of residual traces. The aluminum matrix shines again with its natural metallic\
    \ luster, and the SiC reinforcement particles are clearly visible, showing sharp, defined edges without the dull, patchy\
    \ deposits. Surface roughness also improves, dropping from an estimated 3.5 µm Ra to near the original 1.2 µm Ra, which\
    \ I confirm with profilometry measurements.  \n\nThis transformation is obvious, and the micro-cracks I saw earlier (about\
    \ 2 µm wide) appear less pronounced, likely because debris is removed. EDX analysis now shows much lower carbon and oxygen\
    \ signals, confirming effective removal of organic and oxide films. So, reflectivity (0.35 dimensionless) and thermal\
    \ conductivity (180 W/m·K) should be restored, very-very good for functional performance. Yet, some tiny pits—around 1–2\
    \ µm deep—are visible, possibly from laser ablation near the threshold of 2.8 J/cm². This surface looks clean, much better\
    \ for applications like electronics or aerospace, and I see integrity is maintained with no major damage to the matrix\
    \ or reinforcement."
