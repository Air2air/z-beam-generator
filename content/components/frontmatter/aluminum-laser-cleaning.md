### Aluminum Surface Preparation with Laser Technology

Aluminum substrates require specialized laser cleaning approaches due to their high reflectivity and thermal conductivity. The process effectively removes oxide layers, oils, and other contaminants while minimizing thermal damage to the base material.

### Material Properties
- Thermal conductivity: 237 W/m·K
- Melting point: 660°C
- Surface reflectivity: 90-95% at 1064nm wavelength
- Common contaminants: Aluminum oxide, oils, adhesives

### Process Optimization
The laser parameters must be carefully selected to avoid melting the aluminum surface. Shorter wavelengths and appropriate fluences are typically required for effective cleaning without damage.

### Industrial Applications
- Aerospace component preparation
- Automotive part cleaning
- Electronic component manufacturing
- Marine equipment maintenance
