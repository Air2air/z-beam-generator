description: Technical overview of Aluminum, Al, for laser cleaning. Aluminum, characterized
  by its symbol Al and atomic number 13, is a lightweight metal extensively used in
  industries like automotive and aerospace. Laser cleaning of aluminum involves the
  use of short-pulse lasers at a wavelength of 1064nm to remove surface contaminants
  such as paint, corrosion, and oxides without damaging the underlying material. This
  non-contact method ensures precision and preservation of the aluminum's microstructure,
  making it ideal for surface preparation and restoration processes.
