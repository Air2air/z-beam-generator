caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the nickel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a rough, textured
    topography. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden, with contamination
    concentrated in the grain boundaries and surface micro-features, disrupting the
    native reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to a pristine metallic state.
    The surface now exhibits a clean, well-defined grain structure with sharp boundaries.
    Contaminants have been completely ablated, revealing the native FCC crystalline
    surface with minimal micro-pitting. The reflectivity is significantly enhanced,
    and the original surface texture is clearly visible and intact.
