caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the nickel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a rough, textured topography. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden, with contamination concentrated in the grain boundaries and surface micro-features, disrupting the native reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to a pristine metallic state. The surface now exhibits a clean, well-defined grain structure with sharp boundaries. Contaminants have been completely ablated, revealing the native FCC crystalline surface with minimal micro-pitting. The reflectivity is significantly enhanced, and the original surface texture is clearly visible and intact.
