        research_basis: Nickel exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion in many
          environments, particularly in neutral and alkaline conditions, and against
          caustic alkalis. It maintains good resistance to atmospheric corrosion,
          fresh water, and seawater. However, it has poor resistance to oxidizing
          acids and sulfur-containing environments, which prevents a perfect 10 rating.

        research_basis: The ASM Handbook states that commercially pure nickel (Nickel
          200/201) has a maximum continuous service temperature of approximately 600°F
          (316°C) in oxidizing atmospheres before significant oxidation occurs. Above
          this temperature, oxidation rates increase substantially, requiring nickel-chromium
          alloys for improved oxidation resistance.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure nickel is highly dependent
          on its form (wrought, cast, powder) and temper/condition (annealed vs. cold-worked).
          For annealed, commercially pure (99.5%) wrought nickel, the compressive
          yield strength (0.2% offset) is typically in the range of 70-150 MPa. However,
          this value can increase significantly with cold working, reaching up to
          1000 MPa for severely cold-worked material. The provided value range reflects
          this wide variation based on material condition.
