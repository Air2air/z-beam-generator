"caption":
  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the contaminated nickel surface shows a non-uniform layer of organic and oxide contaminants, measuring 2-5 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film that obscures the underlying metal grain structure. Particulate matter, ranging from 10-50 micrometers in diameter, is embedded within this film.\n\nThe surface texture is irregular, with visible pitting and discoloration. The native protective oxide layer is disrupted by these contaminants, creating a topographically varied landscape. This contamination interferes with the metal's inherent reflectivity, giving the surface a matte, non-metallic appearance at the microscopic level."
  "afterText": "Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying nickel substrate. The surface now displays a clearly defined grain structure with distinct grain boundaries, which was previously obscured. The uniform, metallic appearance confirms the restoration of the native oxide layer.\n\nThe laser process has eliminated the embedded particulate matter and organic residues, resulting in a surface with sub-micrometer roughness. This precision cleaning preserves the base metal integrity while removing only the contamination. The reflectivity has been restored, evident from the characteristic metallic luster visible under magnification.\n\nAnalysis confirms the surface is free of heat-affected zones or ablation damage, demonstrating the process's selectivity. The cleaned surface exhibits the optimal topography and chemical state required for subsequent manufacturing processes or applications where surface purity is critical."
