caption:
  beforeText: 'A nickel surface requiring laser cleaning typically presents a complex layer of contamination. This can include
    organic films, such as oils and greases, and inorganic oxides that form a tenacious, passivating scale. For a metal like
    nickel, which naturally develops a protective oxide layer, this contamination is often chemically bonded to the substrate.


    The primary challenge lies in nickel's intrinsic properties. Its high thermal conductivity (90.7 W/m·K) means it readily
    dissipates heat, making localized contaminant removal difficult without imparting excessive energy. Furthermore, its significant
    reflectivity (~63% at 1064 nm) means most laser energy is initially rejected, requiring precise laser parameters to overcome
    this and effectively target the contaminants without damaging the underlying metal.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a metallurgically pure nickel surface, entirely free of oxides and organic residues.
    The process achieves this by selectively ablating contaminants, leaving the substrate's microstructure intact and undamaged.
    The result is a pristine, oxide-free surface with restored reflectivity and optimal properties for subsequent manufacturing
    steps, such as welding, plating, or bonding, ensuring superior performance and hygiene.
