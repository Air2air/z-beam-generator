  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated nickel surface shows a non-uniform layer of organic and oxide contaminants,
    measuring 2-5 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a dark, amorphous film that obscures the underlying metal grain
    structure. Particulate matter, ranging from 10-50 micrometers in diameter, is embedded within this film.


    The surface texture is irregular, with visible pitting and discoloration. The native protective oxide layer is disrupted
    by these contaminants, creating a topographically varied landscape. This contamination interferes with the metal''s inherent
    reflectivity, giving the surface a matte, non-metallic appearance at the microscopic level.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying nickel substrate. The surface now
    displays a clearly defined grain structure with distinct grain boundaries, which was previously obscured. The uniform,
    metallic appearance confirms the restoration of the native oxide layer.


    The laser process has eliminated the embedded particulate matter and organic residues, resulting in a surface with sub-micrometer
    roughness. This precision cleaning preserves the base metal integrity while removing only the contamination. The reflectivity
    has been restored, evident from the characteristic metallic luster visible under magnification.


    Analysis confirms the surface is free of heat-affected zones or ablation damage, demonstrating the process''s selectivity.
    The cleaned surface exhibits the optimal topography and chemical state required for subsequent manufacturing processes
    or applications where surface purity is critical.'
