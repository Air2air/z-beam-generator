caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the nickel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of
    particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and intergranular oxides that have infiltrated
    the grain boundaries. The native FCC crystalline structure is not visible. The
    surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination forming dendritic patterns
    and localized corrosion pits that compromise the substrate''s integrity and reflectivity.


    The topography shows evidence of surface degradation, where the protective nickel
    oxide layer has been breached. This allows atmospheric contaminants to adhere
    directly to the base metal, creating a matte, dark appearance at the macroscopic
    level. The contaminants effectively mask the underlying metal''s mechanical properties
    and create potential sites for further corrosive attack.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x reveals a complete restoration
    of the native nickel microstructure. The contamination layer has been entirely
    removed via ablation, exposing the distinct, equiaxed grains of the face-centered
    cubic crystal structure. The surface is now characterized by a uniform, micro-rough
    texture with clearly defined grain boundaries, free of embedded particulates and
    corrosion products.


    The laser process has restored the substrate''s original reflectivity and metallurgical
    integrity. The cleaned surface exhibits a consistent morphology with minimal heat-affected
    zone, preserving the base metal''s hardness and tensile strength. Any residual
    features are limited to shallow, sub-micron ripples indicative of controlled laser-material
    interaction, resulting in a pristine, metallurgically sound finish.'
