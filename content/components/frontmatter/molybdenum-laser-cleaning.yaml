caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of oxides,
    adsorbed hydrocarbons, and particulate matter, exhibits a textured, matte topography
    that masks the underlying metal grain structure. The contaminants form irregular,
    splotchy patterns, with localized pitting and discoloration indicative of surface
    oxidation. The native metallic luster and crystallographic features of the molybdenum
    are entirely concealed.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the surface to its intrinsic state, revealing
    a distinct grain structure with clearly defined boundaries at 500x magnification.
    The contaminant layer is completely ablated, exposing a clean, reflective surface
    with minimal topographical alteration. The process effectively removes oxides
    and embedded particles without the sub-surface damage associated with mechanical
    methods. The resulting surface exhibits a uniform, slightly matte metallic finish,
    with a measured surface roughness (Sa) typically below 0.5 µm. This pristine condition
    is critical for subsequent high-performance applications, such as thin-film deposition
    in electronics or high-temperature brazing in aerospace components, where adhesion
    and thermal contact are paramount.
