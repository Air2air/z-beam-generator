caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    carbon deposits and discrete oxide particles (MoO₃), which form a textured, matte
    topography. The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely masked. The contaminants
    exhibit a cracked, island-like pattern, a result of thermal cycling and oxidation,
    which significantly increases surface roughness and reduces the material's inherent
    reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the pristine metallic surface. The
    contamination layer is completely absent, revealing the distinct, clean grain
    boundaries of the molybdenum's BCC crystalline structure. The surface is now smooth
    and highly reflective, with the laser process leaving no measurable subsurface
    thermal damage to the base metal.
