caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. A discontinuous
    oxide scale, approximately 2-5 micrometers thick, appears as a dark, mottled crust with a cracked-mud pattern. Particulate
    contaminants, including embedded carbonaceous soot and metallic splatter from adjacent processes, are scattered across
    the surface. This layer significantly masks the underlying metallic grain structure and imparts a high degree of surface
    roughness.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the superficial contamination layer, revealing the underlying molybdenum
    substrate. The dark, mottled oxide scale and embedded particulates are absent, leaving a clean, reflective metallic surface.
    The process has successfully ablated the contaminants without exceeding molybdenum''s ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm²,
    thus preserving the base material.


    The surface now exhibits the characteristic features of the bare metal, including a discernible grain structure. The reflectivity
    has increased significantly from the previously obscured state, consistent with molybdenum''s inherent 58% reflectivity
    at the laser''s 1064 nm wavelength. Minor, sub-micrometer laser scan lines are visible, indicating the precise, raster-based
    path of the laser beam. The result is a uniformly clean surface suitable for high-value applications like semiconductor
    manufacturing, where micron-level contamination control is critical.'
