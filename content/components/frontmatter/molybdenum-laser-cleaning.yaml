caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbon deposits and discrete oxide particles (MoO₃), which form a textured, matte topography. The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely masked, and the surface exhibits a high degree of diffuse scattering due to this porous, light-absorbing crust.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a dramatic transformation. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the pristine, polycrystalline grain structure of the base molybdenum. The surface now exhibits a specular, metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries.


    The process has restored the material''s native reflectivity, measured at approximately 57% for the 1064 nm wavelength used. At the operational scale, this translates to a surface free of particulate inclusions and oxide films, with a roughness profile now dictated by the metal''s original microstructure rather than foreign deposits. This state is critical for applications requiring optimal thermal and electrical contact.'
