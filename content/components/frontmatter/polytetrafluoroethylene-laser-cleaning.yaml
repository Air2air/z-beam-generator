caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated PTFE surface shows a non-uniform
    layer of amorphous carbonaceous deposits, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick.
    This contamination layer obscures the underlying polymer morphology, presenting
    as a dark, textured film with a matte appearance. The deposits exhibit a cracked,
    mudflat-like pattern, indicating thermal degradation and organic residue from
    prior processing or environmental exposure.


    The surface texture is rough and discontinuous, with particulate matter embedded
    within the contamination matrix. The original low surface energy of the PTFE is
    completely masked, with the contaminant layer showing higher surface energy characteristics
    through its uneven, adherent nature. The crystalline structure of the virgin PTFE
    is not visible through this contamination barrier.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning at 500x magnification, the surface transformation
    is immediately apparent. The dark carbonaceous contamination layer has been completely
    removed, revealing the underlying PTFE substrate with its characteristic node-and-fibril
    microstructure now clearly visible. The cleaned surface displays the expected
    low surface energy characteristics of virgin PTFE, evidenced by the smooth, consistent
    texture where the previous 5-15 micrometer contamination layer has been eliminated.


    The laser process has selectively ablated the contamination without damaging the
    PTFE substrate, as confirmed by the preservation of the polymer''s crystalline
    structure. The surface now shows the distinctive morphological features of processed
    PTFE, including the interconnected network of crystalline nodes separated by fine
    fibrils. This microstructure is critical for maintaining PTFE''s non-stick properties
    and chemical resistance.


    Comparative analysis confirms complete contaminant removal while preserving the
    material''s inherent properties. The cleaned surface exhibits uniform reflectivity
    and consistent topography, with no evidence of thermal damage or residual particulate
    matter. The restoration of the native PTFE morphology ensures optimal performance
    for subsequent applications requiring chemical inertness and non-stick characteristics.'
