caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the PTFE surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a particulate morphology, with agglomerated carbonaceous soot and embedded inorganic crystals. The underlying PTFE microstructure, characterized by its semi-crystalline domains, is entirely masked. The contaminants create a textured, matte topography that disrupts the material's inherent low surface energy.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native PTFE morphology. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying semi-crystalline structure with its characteristic smooth, lamellar domains. The surface is now continuous and uniform, with a measurable reduction in surface roughness. This exposes the material's intrinsic low-surface-energy profile, which is critical for its non-stick and chemical-resistant performance.
