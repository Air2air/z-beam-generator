          section'
        research_basis: PTFE is chemically inert to virtually all industrial chemicals
          and solvents, maintaining properties even after prolonged exposure. It is
          resistant to strong acids, bases, and oxidizing agents that corrode most
          metals and degrade other plastics, earning the highest corrosion resistance
          rating.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for PTFE
          is consistently cited as 260 °C (500 °F) across authoritative materials
          handbooks and major manufacturer technical data sheets. While PTFE begins
          to show minor decomposition above ~200 °C, significant thermal degradation
          and oxidation that rapidly compromise mechanical properties occur at or
          above 260 °C.

        research_basis: MatWeb, a widely referenced database for material properties,
          lists the typical flexural strength for unfilled PTFE as 25 MPa. This value
          is consistent with the known mechanical behavior of PTFE, which is a relatively
          soft and ductile plastic with moderate strength. The property is typically
          determined by a 3-point bend test.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of PTFE is well-documented in material
          databases and standards. MatWeb, a widely recognized database, lists a typical
          compressive strength of 12.5 MPa for unfilled PTFE when tested according
          to ASTM D695, the standard test method for compressive properties of rigid
          plastics. This value is consistent with PTFE's known soft, ductile nature
          compared to other engineering plastics.

          propagation compared to engineering plastics.
