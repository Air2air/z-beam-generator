  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated brass surface is dominated by a non-uniform oxide layer, appearing
    as dark, mottled patches of copper(II) oxide (CuO) and lighter areas of zinc oxide (ZnO). This layer, typically 1-5 micrometers
    thick, obscures the underlying metal grain structure. The surface texture is irregular, with particulate contamination
    and micro-fissures creating a topographically complex and rough landscape.


    The contamination is not a continuous film. Instead, it forms isolated islands and dendritic structures that follow the
    original machining marks, which are still faintly visible beneath. This indicates localized corrosion attack. The varied
    coloration—from dark browns to lighter greys—corresponds to different chemical compounds and thicknesses within the corrosion
    products, resulting in a heterogeneous and optically dull surface.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The non-uniform oxide layer has been completely
    removed, revealing the homogeneous, underlying brass microstructure. The original machining marks, once obscured, are
    now clearly defined and run uniformly across the surface.


    The laser process has restored the metal''s intrinsic reflectivity, creating a much smoother and more consistent surface
    topography. The removal of the porous corrosion products and particulate matter has eliminated the micro-fissures and
    dendritic structures, leaving a clean, continuous metallic surface where the individual grains of the brass alloy are
    now distinctly visible.'
