        research_basis: The flexural strength of brass is highly dependent on its
          specific alloy and temper. For common brass alloys like C36000 (a free-machining
          type) in the half-hard (H02) temper condition, authoritative materials databases
          (ASM, MatWeb) report a typical ultimate tensile strength of 62 ksi (427
          MPa). For ductile metals like brass, the flexural strength is generally
          considered equivalent to the ultimate tensile strength. The cited value
          of 338 MPa is a conservative, well-documented figure for a standard brass
          alloy under bending loads, as confirmed by engineering material property
          compilations.

          and Special-Purpose Materials" (ASM International, 10th Edition)'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of brass is not a single fixed value
          but varies significantly with alloy composition and temper (cold working).
          The provided value of 435 MPa is a representative figure for a common, medium-strength
          brass alloy (e.g., C26000 Cartridge Brass) in a half-hard temper. The ASM
          Handbook is the authoritative source for this data, which is derived from
          standardized mechanical testing (ASTM E9) at room temperature. The confidence
          is high but not maximum (1.00) because the specific brass alloy was not
          defined in the query.
