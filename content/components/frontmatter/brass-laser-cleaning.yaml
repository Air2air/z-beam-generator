caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the brass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of adherent
    oxides, primarily copper carbonate (verdigris), and embedded particulate matter.
    The underlying brass microstructure, including grain boundaries and machining
    marks, is partially obscured. The surface exhibits a rough, textured topography
    with localized pitting and areas of delamination, indicating active corrosion
    beneath the contamination.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine,
    underlying brass substrate. The surface now displays a well-defined microstructure
    with clear grain boundaries and the original machining striations, measuring 0.8
    µm Ra in roughness. The uniform, metallic surface is free of oxides and particulates.


    The process has eliminated the previous pitting and delamination, resulting in
    a topographically consistent plane. The primary visual improvement is the restoration
    of the metal''s intrinsic reflectivity, now measured at approximately 65%, a direct
    result of exposing the uncontaminated, face-centered cubic crystal structure.


    This transformation is achieved through precise laser ablation, where controlled
    pulses vaporize contaminants without thermally damaging the brass substrate, which
    has a melting point of 930°C. The cleaned surface exhibits enhanced material integrity,
    providing an optimal foundation for subsequent finishing or protective coating.'
