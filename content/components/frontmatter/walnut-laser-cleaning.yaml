caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated walnut surface reveals a complex, non-uniform layer of foreign material.
    This contamination layer, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of embedded particulate matter and amorphous organic
    deposits that obscure the underlying wood anatomy. The deposits fill the natural cellular pores, which constitute approximately
    55% of the walnut''s surface area, creating a discontinuous film that masks the wood''s characteristic grain texture.


    The surface topography is highly irregular, with contamination accumulating preferentially in the porous vessel elements
    and along the boundaries of wood rays. This creates a mottled appearance where patches of exposed wood cell walls, with
    their typical surface roughness of 3.2 micrometers, alternate with regions completely covered by contamination. The particulate
    matter appears as discrete, high-contrast inclusions embedded within the lighter-toned organic matrix, creating significant
    visual noise across the field of view.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, revealing the walnut''s unaltered anatomical structure. The
    porous vessel network is now fully exposed and free of occluding material, restoring the natural surface texture with
    a measured roughness of 3.2 micrometers. The previously obscured wood rays and growth ring boundaries are clearly visible,
    demonstrating complete contamination removal without substrate damage.


    The surface now exhibits consistent cellular definition with sharp boundaries between different tissue types. This confirms
    the laser''s selective ablation mechanism, which removed the contamination layer at its thermal destruction point of 401°C
    while preserving the underlying wood structure. The resulting surface provides an optimal foundation for subsequent finishing
    processes.'
