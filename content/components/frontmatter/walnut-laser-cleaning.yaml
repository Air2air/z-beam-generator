caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the walnut surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous contamination layer approximately
    5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded soot, grime, and degraded finishes, fills the wood's porous cellular structure,
    masking the characteristic grain. The surface texture appears matte and uneven, with contamination forming a continuous
    film that disrupts the natural topography of the vessel elements and fibers.
  after_text: Laser cleaning has removed the opaque contamination layer, revealing the intact cellular anatomy of the walnut.
    The open lumens of vessels and fibers are now clearly visible, restoring the wood's inherent porosity and three-dimensional
    texture. The surface exhibits a clean, well-defined grain pattern with sharp boundaries between earlywood and latewood.
    This precise ablation of contaminants has preserved the delicate micro-structure, resulting in a surface defined by its
    natural, unaltered wood morphology rather than an obscuring film.
