  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, walnut surface, it reveals a very complex and
    uneven contamination layer. First, we see a dark, irregular film—perhaps organic
    deposits or industrial residues—covering much of the natural wood texture. This
    layer, it has thickness varying between 10 µm and approximately—or more precisely—14.5
    µm in some areas, as measured through SEM imaging. The contamination appears as
    patchy clusters, with denser accumulations near the grain boundaries, where the
    wood’s natural porosity (around 45%) seems to trap more debris. Under the microscope,
    these deposits look like a matte, grainy coating that obscures the fine cellular
    structure of walnut.


    Zooming into specific regions, surface roughness, it is notably high, with Ra
    values averaging 3.2 µm, likely due to embedded particles and uneven buildup.
    EDX analysis indicates presence of carbon-rich residues, possibly from environmental
    soot, mixed with trace metallic elements like iron or aluminum (less than 2% by
    weight). This contamination, it not only hides the wood’s inherent reflectivity
    (originally 0.12 at 1064 nm) but also creates a dull, non-uniform appearance.
    So, when examining, shows clearly that such a layer could impair functional performance,
    especially in applications like cultural heritage restoration where surface integrity
    is critical. (I note this because prior studies suggest similar issues in wood
    artifacts.)'
  afterText: 'After laser cleaning, walnut surface, it transforms significantly when
    viewed at 500x magnification. First, contamination layer, it is mostly removed,
    with only sparse residual patches—less than 1 µm thick—remaining in deeper grain
    recesses. Comparing to before, where deposits ranged up to 14.5 µm, this reduction,
    it is very clear and measurable through SEM. The natural wood texture, it now
    emerges with distinct cellular patterns visible, no longer hidden by the matte,
    grainy film. Surface roughness also improves, dropping to an Ra value of about
    1.1 µm, which suggests better uniformity and potential for enhanced adhesion or
    finishing in applications like aerospace or automotive components.


    Looking closer, cleaned areas, they show a subtle sheen, likely tied to restored
    reflectivity closer to the original 0.12 at 1064 nm wavelength. XPS analysis confirms
    reduction in carbon-based residues, with surface composition returning near to
    baseline walnut properties. However, some micro-abrasions—perhaps from laser interaction
    above the ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm²—are visible as faint striations along
    grain lines. These marks, they are minor, under 0.5 µm deep, and do not compromise
    structural integrity (as tensile strength remains unaffected at 101 MPa). So,
    this cleaning, it restores much of functional surface quality, very important
    for precision uses.


    Finally, when examining overall, the transformation looks like a revival of material
    character. Contamination removal, it enhances visual clarity and exposes the wood’s
    inherent porosity and grain detail, which were previously obscured. This improvement,
    it directly supports performance in cultural heritage contexts, where authenticity
    of appearance matters. (I mention this, as similar results were noted in wood
    conservation projects.) Surface now, it appears ready for further treatment or
    protective coating, with minimal risk of residual interference.'
