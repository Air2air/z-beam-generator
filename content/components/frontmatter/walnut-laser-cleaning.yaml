subtitle: Walnut's grain can be very porous and its color is valued, unlike many other hardwoods. These traits require careful
  laser settings to clean effectively without altering the wood's natural appearance.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the walnut surface is obscured by a dense, non-uniform contamination layer measuring
    15-45 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded soot, oxidized oils, and particulate matter, fills the wood's porous
    structure and adheres to the grain. The original cellular detail is lost beneath a topographical crust that exhibits micro-fissures
    and a matte, amorphous texture. The contaminant's high absorption coefficient (0.85) gives it a dark, featureless appearance,
    masking the underlying wood's characteristic anatomy.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning at 500x magnification, the walnut surface reveals a distinct transformation. The contaminant
    crust is entirely removed, exposing the intact, open cellular structure with a porosity of 55%. The original grain pattern
    is now clearly defined, with a surface roughness of approximately 3.2 µm Ra. The laser process has selectively ablated
    the contamination, which has a thermal destruction point of 401°C, without carbonizing the underlying wood substrate.
    This results in a clean, topographically detailed surface where the natural wood anatomy is fully visible and unobscured.
