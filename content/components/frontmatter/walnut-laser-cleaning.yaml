          and decay resistance ratings
        research_basis: Walnut is classified as having moderate to low natural decay
          resistance among hardwoods. While more durable than many domestic species,
          it's not considered highly resistant to fungal decay or insect attack without
          treatment. The Wood Database rates black walnut's decay resistance as "durable"
          but notes it's not suitable for ground contact without preservative treatment,
          placing it in the lower-middle range of wood durability scales.

        research_basis: The provided material properties (specific heat, density)
          are consistent with wood. Authoritative sources like the USDA Wood Handbook
          indicate that significant thermal degradation of wood, including oxidation
          and pyrolysis, begins well below 200°C. For most wood species, prolonged
          exposure to temperatures above 150°C in air leads to significant chemical
          changes, charring, and loss of mechanical strength. Walnut, as a hardwood,
          falls within this general range. The value is a conservative estimate for
          the onset of significant oxidative degradation in an air environment.

          D143). This value is consistent with published data for this hardwood species.
