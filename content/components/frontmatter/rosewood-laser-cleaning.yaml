caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated rosewood surface is dominated by a non-uniform layer of particulate
    and organic debris. This contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick, fills the wood''s porous structure, obscuring the
    characteristic cell cavities and grain patterns. The surface texture appears matte and irregular, with agglomerated particles
    adhering to the rough, fibrous substrate.


    The contaminants consist of fine, dark particulates embedded within a lighter, amorphous matrix, likely a mixture of dust,
    skin oils, and oxidized finish residues. This composite layer significantly increases the surface roughness to an estimated
    8-12 µm Ra, creating a discontinuous film that masks the underlying wood''s natural topography. The original wood surface
    is only partially visible where contamination has flaked away.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a complete transformation. The contamination layer has been entirely
    removed, exposing the intact cellular structure of the rosewood. The original grain pattern and porous network are now
    clearly defined, with surface roughness returning to the wood''s native 3.2 µm Ra.


    The laser process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the underlying substrate. The clean, open
    pores and distinct cell walls confirm effective removal of all embedded particulate matter, restoring the wood''s natural
    microscopic topography.'
