  beforeText: 'When examining rosewood surface under 500x magnification with SEM (Scanning
    Electron Microscopy), contamination layer, it becomes very clear. This layer,
    it appears as uneven, patchy film covering natural wood grain. Thickness of this
    deposit, it varies between approximately 10 µm to—or more precisely—14.7 µm in
    denser areas, especially near the porous regions (as typical for tropical hardwoods
    with 45% porosity). Surface texture looks rough and irregular, with visible debris
    particles embedded, some as large as 5 µm in diameter. These contaminants, they
    seem like a mix of organic residues and inorganic dust, creating a dull, matte
    appearance that hides the wood’s natural luster.


    Further analysis with EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) shows composition
    of this layer, it includes high carbon and oxygen peaks, suggesting organic buildup,
    perhaps from environmental exposure, and traces of silicon and aluminum, likely
    from dust or soil. Surface roughness, measured as Ra (average roughness), stands
    at 3.2 µm, much higher than expected for untreated rosewood. This roughness, it
    creates potential issues for adhesion or finishing in applications like aerospace
    or marine. Under magnification, micro-cracks also visible near contamination edges,
    some extending 2-3 µm into wood structure, indicating possible early degradation.
    So, this contaminated state, it reduces both aesthetic quality and functional
    integrity of material.


    Looking closer, contamination pattern, it is not uniform—thicker near vessel elements
    of wood, where natural pores trap more debris. This unevenness, it distorts reflectivity
    (estimated at 0.25 for near-infrared wavelengths), making surface appear darker
    and less consistent. Such condition, it is critical to address, because long-term
    exposure could worsen micro-damage. First we see the layer, then understand its
    impact on performance, so cleaning becomes very necessary step for restoration.'
  afterText: 'After laser cleaning, rosewood surface under 500x magnification, it
    shows significant transformation. Contamination layer, previously 10-14.7 µm thick,
    now mostly removed, with residual traces less than 1 µm in isolated spots (as
    confirmed by SEM imaging). Surface, it looks much smoother, with Ra roughness
    value reduced to 0.8 µm, a clear improvement from initial 3.2 µm. Natural wood
    grain, it becomes visible again, showing distinct cellular structure and restored
    luster, unlike the dull, matte appearance before. This change, it suggests laser
    ablation (above threshold of 1.2 J/cm²) effectively removed deposits without deep
    damage to substrate.


    Comparing to contaminated state, micro-cracks earlier observed, they appear minimized,
    with most no longer detectable at this magnification. EDX analysis now indicates
    sharp drop in carbon and oxygen peaks, confirming removal of organic residues,
    while silicon and aluminum traces are nearly gone. Reflectivity, it seems improved,
    likely closer to natural value for rosewood, enhancing aesthetic and functional
    quality for automotive or marine uses. Surface integrity, it is restored, with
    no new thermal damage visible—perhaps due to controlled laser parameters avoiding
    thermal decomposition (around 280°C). This cleaning, it preserves material’s tensile
    strength (95 MPa) potential.


    Looking at details, porous regions, they no longer trap debris, showing clean
    vessel elements under magnification. Some minor charring spots, approximately
    2 µm wide, are noted near high-density grain areas, but these are negligible for
    performance. Overall, transformation, it is very clear—surface roughness decreases,
    contamination disappears, and wood’s natural beauty returns. So, laser cleaning
    proves effective for rosewood, ensuring both visual and practical benefits for
    high-value applications.'

  sections. Pay close attention to your laser controls, as even a slight mismatch
  can affect the finish at critical spots.
