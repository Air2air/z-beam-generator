subtitle: Rosewood features a unique, dense grain and natural oils that distinguish
  it from other exotic woods. These properties demand precise laser settings to effectively
  lift contaminants without damaging the wood's rich patina.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rosewood surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter and amorphous organic deposits that fill the natural cellular
    pores and vessel structures. The underlying grain texture is partially masked,
    with contaminants forming a crust-like film that disrupts the wood's intrinsic
    topography and reflectance properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state, revealing
    the intricate anatomical features of the rosewood. The cellular lumen and vessel
    structures are now fully exposed and clearly defined, free from obstructive deposits.
    The original grain pattern is sharply delineated, with a measurable reduction
    in surface roughness.


    The process has selectively removed the contamination layer without inducing macroscopic
    charring or altering the fundamental wood structure. The characteristic density
    and hardness of the material are preserved, as the laser parameters were maintained
    below the 0.8 J/cm² damage threshold to prevent any modification to the cellulose-lignin
    matrix.


    This results in a surface with optimal reflectivity and minimal subsurface thermal
    stress. The cleaned wood exhibits its inherent physical properties, including
    a tensile strength of 157 MPa and a Young''s Modulus of 12.5 GPa, ensuring structural
    integrity is maintained for high-performance applications.'
