caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and particulate matter.
    The underlying metal's microstructure is completely hidden. The surface texture
    is rough and irregular, characterized by agglomerated deposits that disrupt the
    native metallic substrate and create potential sites for pitting and stress concentration.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, underlying titanium substrate. The
    surface now exhibits the fine, polygonal grain structure characteristic of the
    metal's HCP crystalline form. Contaminants are entirely removed, restoring a uniform,
    metallic-grey appearance. The process leaves a clean, slightly matte texture with
    micro-roughness typically below 1 µm, significantly reducing sites for crack initiation
    and improving adhesion for subsequent coatings.
