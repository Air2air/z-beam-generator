caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous soot, and salt crystals, which form a discontinuous, crust-like
    topography. The underlying titanium's characteristic machining marks and grain
    structure are entirely masked. The contaminants exhibit a porous, agglomerated
    morphology, creating a high surface area that promotes further corrosion and compromises
    the material's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the original substrate with its fine machining
    striations and uniform grain structure. The surface is now topographically consistent,
    with no evidence of the prior oxide crust or embedded particulates. This results
    in a metallurgically clean interface, restoring the titanium's high corrosion
    resistance and optimal surface energy for subsequent processing.
