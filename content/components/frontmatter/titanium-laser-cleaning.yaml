caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and particulate deposits.
    The underlying metal's characteristic machining marks and grain structure are
    fully obscured. The surface texture is irregular and porous, with contamination
    adhering within micro-fissures and valleys of the substrate.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the true titanium substrate,
    characterized by its fine, metallic grain structure and original machining marks.
    The contamination layer has been completely ablated, leaving a uniform, oxide-free
    surface.


    The process exploits titanium''s relatively low thermal conductivity (21.9 W/m·K)
    and high laser absorption (~47.5%), allowing efficient energy transfer to the
    contaminants without significant heat penetration into the base metal. This selective
    ablation preserves the material''s integrity and mechanical properties.


    The resulting surface is uniformly clean, with a light matte finish. The reflectivity
    increases measurably as the highly reflective, bare metal is exposed, enhancing
    its performance in applications requiring optimal surface contact or adhesion.'
