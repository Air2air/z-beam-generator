subtitle: Titanium's natural oxide layer gives it a remarkable durability, yet this
  same trait means laser parameters must be exact to avoid a visible, etched appearance.
  A controlled, lower frequency approach typically preserves its distinctive metallic
  sheen.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the titanium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 5-50 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of embedded carbonaceous soot, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and particulate
    residues from manufacturing. The underlying metal's microstructure is entirely
    concealed. The texture is highly irregular, with contamination filling the natural
    micro-valleys and peaks of the substrate, creating a porous, stratified appearance.
    This layer disrupts the surface's thermal and electrical conductivity and provides
    initiation sites for pitting corrosion, which can compromise the component's structural
    integrity in demanding applications.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer entirely, revealing the
    true titanium substrate. At 500x, the surface now exhibits a clean, micro-roughened
    texture consistent with the base metal's grain structure. The process selectively
    ablates contaminants without significant material removal, preserving critical
    dimensional tolerances, often within ±5 micrometers. The resulting surface is
    uniformly clean, with no residual oxides or embedded particles. This exposes a
    metallurgically pure surface, which is essential for optimal performance in subsequent
    processes like bonding, coating, or welding.
