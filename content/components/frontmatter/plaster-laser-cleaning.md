description: Technical overview of Plaster, characterized by the chemical formula
  CaSO4·2H2O, specifically tailored for laser cleaning applications. Plaster, also
  known as gypsum plaster, is a versatile material used in construction and cultural
  heritage preservation. When employing laser cleaning techniques, the material's
  porous nature and sensitivity to thermal changes must be considered to prevent damage
  while effectively removing contaminants.
