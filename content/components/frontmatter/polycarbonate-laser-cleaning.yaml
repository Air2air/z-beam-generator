        research_basis: Polycarbonate exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range
          of chemicals, including dilute acids, alcohols, and oils, contributing to
          a high corrosion resistance rating for a plastic. Its primary vulnerabilities
          are to strong bases, certain hydrocarbons, and UV radiation, which slightly
          reduce its score from a perfect 10. This assessment is based on standardized
          chemical resistance data for engineering plastics.

        research_basis: According to MatWeb, a widely recognized database of material
          properties, the continuous service temperature for polycarbonate in air
          is typically 115-130°C. The value of 125°C represents a conservative midpoint
          of this range, as polycarbonate begins to undergo significant thermal degradation
          and oxidation above this temperature, leading to loss of mechanical properties
          and discoloration.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with standard Polycarbonate. Authoritative material databases (MatWeb, CES
          EduPack) report flexural strength values for Polycarbonate in the range
          of 90-100 MPa for a 3-point bend test. The cited value of 93 MPa is a typical
          median value from manufacturer data sheets for unreinforced, general-purpose
          grades.

        source: MatWeb Material Property Data for Makrolon Polycarbonate
        research_basis: Polycarbonate's compressive strength is consistently reported
          in the 75-85 MPa range by material data sheets from manufacturers like Covestro
          (Makrolon) and SABIC (LEXAN). The value of 80 MPa is a standard reference
          point for general-purpose polycarbonate under standard test conditions (room
          temperature, 23°C). The provided hardness (85.0 MPa) is a related mechanical
          property that supports this compressive strength value, as they often correlate
          for rigid plastics.
