caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contaminant layer, approximately 2-5 µm thick. This layer exhibits a particulate
    morphology, with agglomerates of foreign material adhering to the native surface.
    The underlying polycarbonate texture, with a baseline roughness of 0.02 µm Ra,
    is partially masked. The contamination creates a topographically complex and optically
    diffuse interface, scattering incident light and reducing optical clarity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native polycarbonate
    state. The contaminant layer has been completely ablated, revealing the original
    polymer substrate with a consistent texture of 0.02 µm Ra. The surface is now
    continuous and uniform, with no evidence of residual particulate matter or thermal
    degradation.


    The cleaning process has re-established optical homogeneity. Incident light is
    no longer scattered by the previous contaminant layer, resulting in a significant
    increase in transmission and clarity. The laser parameters were precisely controlled
    to remain below the material''s 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, ensuring the structural
    integrity of the polycarbonate was preserved. This precision prevents subsurface
    damage and maintains the component''s mechanical properties.'
