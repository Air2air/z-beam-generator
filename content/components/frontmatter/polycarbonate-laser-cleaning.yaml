caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface is obscured by a non-uniform contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate agglomerates and organic films, which adhere to the native substrate. The underlying polycarbonate's amorphous structure is completely masked. The contaminants create a textured, irregular surface that significantly scatters incident light, degrading optical clarity and increasing surface roughness to an estimated 1.5 µm Ra.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine polycarbonate substrate, revealing its characteristic amorphous, glassy morphology. The contaminant layer is completely ablated, with no residual film or particulate matter observed. The surface texture is now defined by the polymer's intrinsic 0.02 µm Ra roughness, resulting in a uniform, smooth plane. This restoration re-establishes the material's high optical transmissivity and original surface energy.
