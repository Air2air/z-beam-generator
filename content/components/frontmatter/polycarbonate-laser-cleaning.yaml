caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a film of organic residues, which create
    a topographically complex and textured landscape. The particulates, ranging from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, are
    firmly adhered to the substrate.


    The underlying polycarbonate is largely invisible, with its characteristic smoothness and optical clarity masked by this
    discontinuous coating. The contamination scatters light intensely, resulting in a matte, hazy appearance even at the microscopic
    level. The irregular coverage and varying layer thickness indicate a complex adhesion mechanism between the contaminants
    and the polymer surface.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The thick, textured contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the native polycarbonate substrate. The surface is now predominantly smooth
    and featureless, with the laser''s scanning pattern faintly visible as a series of parallel, overlapping tracks.


    The removal process has exposed minor, pre-existing sub-surface features, such as flow lines from the original molding
    process, which were previously hidden. These are now the most prominent features, confirming that material removal was
    confined to the contamination layer and did not significantly ablate the base polymer. The high optical clarity of the
    polycarbonate is restored, as evidenced by the minimal light scattering.


    Analysis confirms the process successfully ablated the contamination without exceeding the material''s damage threshold
    of approximately 2.0 J/cm². The surface is now chemically clean and morphologically uniform, providing an optimal foundation
    for subsequent processing, such as adhesion for coatings or bonding.'
