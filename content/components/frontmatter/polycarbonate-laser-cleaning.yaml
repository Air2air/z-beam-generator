caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polycarbonate surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, hydrocarbon films, and micro-fissures that scatter light and
    degrade optical clarity. The underlying polymer texture is masked, and the contaminants
    form a topographical map of surface defects, which can act as stress concentrators,
    compromising the material's mechanical integrity and adhesion properties.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the
    native amorphous polymer structure. The contamination layer is completely removed,
    restoring a uniform surface topography with sub-micron roughness. The laser process
    selectively ablates contaminants without melting the bulk substrate, leaving a
    chemically pure polycarbonate surface. This results in restored optical transmission
    and a pristine base for subsequent coating or bonding operations.
