description: Indium, a soft, malleable metal, is widely used in electronics and aerospace
  industries for its unique properties. Laser cleaning of Indium involves precise
  control of laser parameters such as wavelength, fluence, and pulse duration to remove
  contaminants while preserving the material's integrity. This non-contact cleaning
  method is particularly effective for delicate surfaces and intricate components,
  ensuring that the Indium's functionality is maintained post-cleaning.
