description: Laser cleaning of indium requires precise control due to its low melting point (156.6°C) and softness. Pulsed fiber lasers at 1064 nm provide optimal absorption for removing oxides and contaminants without melting or damaging the pure indium substrate, crucial for maintaining electrical and thermal properties in sensitive applications.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical waste generation
  description: Eliminates use of acidic cleaners (HCl, HNO₃) and solvents traditionally used for indium oxide removal, preventing 100+ kg/year of hazardous waste per production line
- benefit: Reduced energy consumption
  description: Laser cleaning consumes 60-70% less energy compared to ultrasonic cleaning with heated chemical baths for indium components
