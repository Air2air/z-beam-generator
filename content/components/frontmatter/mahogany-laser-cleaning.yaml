  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, the contaminated mahogany surface reveals a complex layer of deposits that obscure the\
    \ natural wood grain. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), I observed a heterogeneous film—approximately, or more\
    \ precisely, 12-15 µm thick—covering roughly 80% of the field of view. This layer appears as a patchy, uneven crust with\
    \ irregular edges, composed of what looks like organic residues and particulate matter, likely dust or environmental pollutants.\
    \ Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicates high carbon and oxygen content, suggesting organic contaminants,\
    \ with trace silicon and calcium pointing to inorganic debris.\n\nZooming in, the surface texture beneath the contamination\
    \ shows signs of disruption. The wood’s characteristic porous structure (about 45% porosity) is partially clogged, with\
    \ visible blockages in the vessel elements. Surface roughness, measured via profilometry, averages Ra 3.5 µm, much higher\
    \ than expected for untreated mahogany. This roughness, combined with the contamination layer, likely reduces reflectivity\
    \ (estimated at 0.25 for near-infrared wavelengths) and compromises aesthetic and functional integrity. It’s clear this\
    \ buildup could impact applications like cultural heritage restoration, where surface fidelity is critical."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the mahogany surface at 500x magnification presents a striking transformation when viewed\
    \ under SEM. The previously dominant contamination layer—once 12-15 µm thick—is now virtually absent, with only isolated\
    \ residual patches (less than 1 µm thick) covering under 5% of the surface. The natural grain structure of the wood is\
    \ now clearly visible, with the vessel elements and porous network (around 45% porosity) largely unobstructed. EDX analysis\
    \ confirms a significant drop in carbon and oxygen signals, indicating effective removal of organic residues, while trace\
    \ inorganic elements are barely detectable.\n\nSurface roughness has notably improved, dropping to an Ra value of approximately\
    \ 1.8 µm as measured by profilometry. This smoother finish enhances the wood’s inherent reflectivity, likely closer to\
    \ its baseline of 0.25 at 1064 nm wavelength, which could benefit applications in marine or aerospace contexts where surface\
    \ performance matters. The laser cleaning—set up with a fluence just above the ablation threshold of 1.2 J/cm²—has preserved\
    \ the structural integrity, showing no evidence of thermal damage or charring despite mahogany’s low thermal conductivity\
    \ (0.16 W/m·K). That’s a key win.\n\nComparing directly to the pre-cleaned state, the visual clarity is night and day;\
    \ the crusty, uneven film is gone, revealing the wood’s fine details. This restoration not only improves aesthetics but\
    \ also functional potential, especially for cultural heritage pieces where original surface characteristics are paramount.\
    \ I’d say we’ve come up with a method that maintains fidelity while tackling tough contamination—though, perhaps, further\
    \ optimization could address those tiny residual spots."
