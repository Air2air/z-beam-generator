caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous film, ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers in
    thickness, adheres to the wood''s cellular structure. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, oxidized resin residues, and microbial biofilms that fill
    the porous vessel elements.


    The underlying wood texture is partially masked. Contaminants have preferentially
    accumulated within the lumens of the large, open vessels characteristic of mahogany,
    creating a speckled pattern. The surface topography is irregular, with the foreign
    material forming a crust that bridges across the natural grain, obscuring the
    fine details of the cellular anatomy and creating a matte, occluded appearance.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed via selective photoablation, revealing the clean,
    open vessels and the distinct, honeycombed structure of the wood''s parenchyma
    cells.


    The original surface texture is now fully visible, with no thermal damage to the
    delicate cell walls. The laser process has effectively cleared all occluding residues,
    resulting in a microscopically clean surface that exposes the intrinsic, porous
    architecture of the mahogany.'

subtitle: Pay close attention to mahogany’s varying grain density during laser treatment.
  If you push power beyond 50 watts on denser sections, you’ll risk uneven removal
  and compromise the wood’s natural finish.
