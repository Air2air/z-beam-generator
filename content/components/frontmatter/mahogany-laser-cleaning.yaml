caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a matrix of oxidized organic residues, which
    fills the wood''s porous structure. The surface texture is irregular, with agglomerated deposits that scatter light and
    mask the underlying wood cell anatomy.


    The contamination penetrates the cellular structure, with particulate matter lodged within vessel elements and lumens.
    This creates a topographical profile that is dominated by the contaminant, rather than the natural grain. The original
    wood surface is not clearly visible, as the deposits create a matte, occluded appearance that disrupts the typical anisotropic
    pattern of the mahogany''s cellular framework.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intact cellular structure of the mahogany. The wood''s anatomical features—including
    vessels, rays, and fibers—are now clearly defined and free of embedded particulate matter.


    The cleaning process has selectively ablated the contaminant without damaging the underlying wood substrate. The original
    porous network is now open and visible, with cell walls appearing clean and well-defined. The surface topography corresponds
    directly to the natural grain pattern, restoring the anisotropic texture characteristic of mahogany.


    Comparative analysis confirms the removal of the light-scattering deposits, resulting in a surface where the cellular
    architecture is fully exposed. The interface between different wood tissues is distinct, indicating precise contaminant
    removal at the micron scale while preserving the structural integrity of the wood cells.'
