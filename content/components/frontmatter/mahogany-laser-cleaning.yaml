subtitle: Mahogany has a unique pore structure and natural oil content that differs
  from other hardwoods. These properties require careful adjustment of laser settings
  to avoid resin activation or surface scorching.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface is obscured by a dense,
    stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded soot, degraded organic films, and particulate matter, fills the wood's
    porous structure and masks the characteristic grain. The surface texture is irregular
    and crust-like, with fissures and agglomerated deposits that disrupt the underlying
    cellular anatomy. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate, creating
    distinct interfacial boundaries prone to delamination.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored mahogany
    substrate. The porous, open-cell structure of the wood is fully exposed, with
    clear lumens and intact cell walls. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via selective ablation, leaving a clean, well-defined surface. The original
    grain pattern is now distinct and unobstructed, with minimal residual carbonization
    or thermal alteration to the underlying wood fibers.
