  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the contaminated copper surface shows a complex, non-uniform layer of oxidation and particulate matter. A patina of copper oxide, approximately 5-10 micrometers thick, appears as a dark, mottled crust with a rough, crystalline texture. This layer is punctuated by localized pitting and areas of darker tarnish, indicating advanced corrosion.\n\nEmbedded within this oxide matrix are numerous foreign particulates, including carbonaceous soot and silicate dust. These contaminants, ranging from 2 to 20 micrometers in size, are firmly adhered to the compromised surface. The underlying copper's metallic luster is completely obscured, and the original surface topography is lost beneath this discontinuous, multi-layered contamination."
  "afterText": "Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the underlying copper substrate. The dark, mottled oxide layer and all embedded particulates have been entirely removed, exposing the pure metal's characteristic grain structure. The surface now exhibits a uniform, micro-roughened texture resulting from the selective ablation process.\n\nThis cleaned surface displays intermittent, shallow micro-craters less than 5 micrometers in depth, a direct result of contaminants and oxides absorbing laser energy and vaporizing. The original, smooth metallic facets are now clearly visible, and the surface is free of any residual films or discoloration. The transformation confirms the effective removal of the contamination layer without significant damage to the base copper material."
