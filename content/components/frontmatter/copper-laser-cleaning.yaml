caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the copper surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of a complex matrix of copper oxide (Cu₂O/CuO) nodules and adsorbed atmospheric sulfates, creating a textured, matte topography. The underlying metal's characteristic FCC grain structure is entirely hidden beneath this porous, insulating crust, which exhibits micro-fissures and localized pitting from ongoing corrosive activity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine, underlying copper substrate. The surface now displays the distinct grain boundaries of its face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure, with grain sizes varying from 10 to 50 µm. The visual transformation is significant; the previous matte, textured crust has been replaced by a microscopically smooth, reflective metallic surface.


    The process has selectively ablated the oxides and sulfates without damaging the base metal, as the laser energy was precisely controlled to remain below copper''s ablation threshold of approximately 0.8 J/cm². This precision preserves the material''s integrity, maintaining its high thermal conductivity of 401 W/m·K and electrical properties.


    No evidence of melting or heat-affected zones is observed, confirming that the bulk material temperature remained well below the 1085°C melting point. The result is a clean, metallurgically pure surface with restored functionality for electrical and thermal applications, free from the insulating and corrosive effects of the previous contamination.'
