caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the copper surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of porous, amorphous
    oxides (Cu₂O, CuO) and adsorbed atmospheric carbon, creating a matte, topographically
    complex texture. The underlying metal's crystalline FCC structure is entirely
    hidden by this insulating, low-reflectivity crust, which exhibits micro-cracking
    and granular particulate matter.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, polycrystalline FCC structure of
    the base copper. The surface now exhibits a uniform, micro-rough texture with
    clearly defined grain boundaries, free of oxide layers and particulate matter.
    This restoration results in a significant increase in surface reflectivity, approaching
    the material's intrinsic 98% value, and exposes the pure, thermally conductive
    metal substrate.
