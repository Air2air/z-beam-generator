        research_basis: Copper develops a protective patina (primarily basic copper
          sulfate) that inhibits further corrosion, providing excellent resistance
          to atmospheric corrosion, fresh water, and seawater. It maintains this high
          rating despite being susceptible to specific corrosive environments like
          ammonia compounds and sulfur gases.

        research_basis: The ASM Handbook states that while copper is generally considered
          to have good oxidation resistance at room temperature, significant oxidation
          begins in the range of 300-400°C in air. The lower end of this range (300°C)
          is cited as the maximum temperature for continuous service in oxidizing
          environments before oxide scaling becomes a serious issue.

        research_basis: Copper is a ductile metal, and its flexural strength is not
          a primary design property like its tensile yield strength. The value provided
          is an estimate based on the relationship between tensile strength and flexural
          strength for ductile materials, using a typical tensile strength range of
          210-220 MPa for annealed copper as a basis. Direct citations for a standardized
          3-point bend test on pure copper are less common than for tensile properties.

          and Special-Purpose Materials (10th Edition), Table "Typical Mechanical
          Properties of Wrought Copper"'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed copper is not a
          single fixed value but is dependent on its temper (condition). For annealed
          (soft) OFHC (Oxygen-Free High Thermal Conductivity) copper, the compressive
          yield strength (the standard measure for compressive strength in metals)
          is typically in the range of 70-210 MPa. The value of 210 MPa represents
          a common upper-bound value for annealed material and aligns with the yield
          strength under compression, which is approximately equal to its tensile
          yield strength for ductile metals like copper. The ASM Handbook is a globally
          recognized authoritative source for material properties.
