caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface is obscured by a
    complex contamination layer. This stratum, measuring 5-15 µm thick, consists of
    embedded carbonaceous soot, oxide scale, and particulate matter. The underlying
    metal's topography is completely masked, presenting a rough, porous texture with
    a high degree of micro-scale irregularity. The contaminants form a non-uniform,
    discontinuous film that adheres to the substrate, compromising the material's
    inherent corrosion resistance and creating potential sites for pitting initiation.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, underlying
    austenitic grain structure of the stainless steel. The contamination layer has
    been completely removed via ablation, restoring the original metallic luster and
    a surface roughness approximating the base material's 0.8 µm Ra. The process eliminates
    micro-crevices, resulting in a homogeneous, passivation-ready surface that enhances
    the alloy's intrinsic corrosion resistance.
