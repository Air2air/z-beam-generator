caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous soot, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and particulate matter. The underlying metal's fine grinding marks are partially visible beneath this porous, textured crust, which disrupts the substrate's natural reflectivity and creates a matte, non-uniform appearance.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the unaltered, homogeneous austenitic grain structure of the stainless steel substrate. The process has completely removed the contamination layer without mechanical abrasion, preserving the original mill-finish topography characterized by shallow, parallel grooves with an average roughness (Ra) of approximately 0.8 µm.


    The primary visual transformation is the restoration of the metal''s inherent reflectivity, as the high laser reflectivity (≈65%) of the base material prevented significant energy absorption and subsequent melting. This results in a surface free of heat-affected zones or oxide discoloration.


    The cleaning mechanism relied on the selective ablation of contaminants, which have a significantly lower vaporization threshold than the steel''s melting point of 1400°C. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallurgically intact profile, restoring its corrosion-resistant properties and providing an optimal foundation for subsequent finishing or coating processes.'
