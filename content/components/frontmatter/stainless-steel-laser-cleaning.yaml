caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface is obscured by a
    non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded oxides, carbonaceous soot, and particulate matter, disrupts the underlying
    metallic grain structure. The surface texture appears irregular and matte, with
    contaminants filling the natural micro-valleys of the mill-finished surface, significantly
    increasing its effective roughness.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the intact, underlying austenitic
    grain structure with sharp boundaries. The contamination layer is entirely removed,
    restoring the original micro-topography with a measured roughness near 0.8 µm
    Ra. The surface exhibits a consistent, clean metallic luster, free from residual
    oxides or embedded particles.
