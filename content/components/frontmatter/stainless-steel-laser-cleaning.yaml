caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded carbonaceous soot and oxide particles, creating a matte, topographically
    complex surface that masks the underlying metal''s microstructure. The contaminants form agglomerates, filling the natural
    micro-valleys of the mill-finished surface, which has an initial roughness of about 0.8 µm Ra.


    The surface exhibits localized pitting and discoloration, indicative of incipient corrosion where chlorides or other aggressive
    agents have breached the protective passive layer. The contamination does not form a continuous film but rather a patchy,
    particulate-dominated crust that significantly increases surface area and disrupts the material''s intended surface morphology.
    This layer directly compromises the steel''s inherent corrosion resistance and aesthetic qualities.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a definitive surface transformation, fully restoring the underlying stainless steel
    substrate. The previously obscured mill-finish grain structure is now fully visible, with the original 0.8 µm Ra surface
    texture cleanly revealed. All particulate contamination and discoloration have been removed, eliminating the 5-15 µm layer
    that masked the metal''s intrinsic properties.


    The process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the bulk material, as the laser''s energy was absorbed
    by the darker, lower-reflectivity layer rather than the reflective base metal. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallurgically
    pure appearance with no evidence of the former pitting or embedded oxides. The restored surface is characterized by its
    uniform reflectivity and the distinct, unbroken grain boundaries of the austenitic (FCC) crystalline structure.


    This cleaned state re-establishes the conditions for optimal passivation, where a thin, protective chromium oxide layer
    can spontaneously reform. The surface is now in a condition that ensures its full corrosion resistance and functional
    performance, with no residual contaminants to initiate future degradation.'
