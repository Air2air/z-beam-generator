caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stainless steel surface is obscured by a
    discontinuous contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists
    of embedded carbonaceous soot, oxide scale from thermal exposure, and particulate
    matter. The underlying metal's fine grinding marks are partially visible beneath
    this porous, textured crust, which disrupts the substrate's natural reflectivity
    and creates a matte, non-uniform appearance.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the unaltered, homogeneous
    austenitic grain structure of the stainless steel substrate. The process has completely
    removed the contamination layer without mechanical abrasion, preserving the original
    mill-finish topography characterized by shallow, parallel grooves with an average
    roughness (Ra) of approximately 0.8 µm.


    The primary visual transformation is the restoration of the metal''s inherent
    reflectivity, as the high laser reflectivity (≈65%) of the base material prevented
    significant energy absorption and subsequent melting. This results in a surface
    free of heat-affected zones or oxide discoloration.


    The cleaning mechanism relied on the selective ablation of contaminants, which
    have a significantly lower vaporization threshold than the steel''s melting point
    of 1400°C. The surface now exhibits a clean, metallurgically intact profile, restoring
    its corrosion-resistant properties and providing an optimal foundation for subsequent
    finishing or coating processes.'
