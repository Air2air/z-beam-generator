          Handbook, Volume 13C)
        research_basis: Stainless steel's chromium content (typically >10.5%) forms
          a passive oxide layer that provides excellent resistance to general atmospheric
          corrosion and many chemical environments. While specific ratings vary by
          grade (304, 316, etc.), stainless steel consistently ranks high in corrosion
          resistance compared to other metals, though not perfect in all environments
          (e.g., chloride exposure).

          Irons, Steels, and High-Performance Alloys" (specifically for austenitic
          stainless steels like Type 304 in continuous service)'
        research_basis: The oxidation resistance of stainless steel is highly dependent
          on its specific grade. For common austenitic grades (e.g., 304, 316), the
          maximum continuous service temperature in air is typically 870-925°C. The
          925°C value represents the upper limit for intermittent service for many
          grades, while continuous service is often limited to 815-870°C. The chromium
          content (typically 17-20% in austenitic steels) forms a protective oxide
          scale, but breakdown occurs rapidly above this range, leading to significant
          oxidation.

        source: ASM Aerospace Specification Metals Inc., "Stainless Steel - Grade
          304 (UNS S30400)"
        research_basis: The flexural strength of stainless steel is not a single fixed
          value and depends heavily on the specific alloy (e.g., 304, 316) and its
          temper condition. For common austenitic grades like 304 in the annealed
          condition, the yield strength (which is closely related to and often used
          as a conservative estimate for flexural strength in ductile metals) is typically
          in the range of 215-290 MPa. The provided value of 290 MPa is a representative
          upper value for the yield strength of annealed 304 stainless steel, which
          is a standard reference point for bending strength in the absence of a specific
          alloy designation.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of stainless steel is not a single
          fixed value and depends heavily on the specific alloy (e.g., 304, 316) and
          its temper condition. For the most common grade, AISI 304 annealed stainless
          steel, the compressive yield strength (the standard measure for compressive
          strength in metals) is approximately 210 MPa. This value is consistently
          reported across materials databases for this specific, widely-used condition.
          The provided material properties in the query are generic and do not specify
          an alloy, making this the most authoritative and probable value.
