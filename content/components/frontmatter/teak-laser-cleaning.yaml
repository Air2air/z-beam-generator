caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the teak surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous film
    of biological growth, approximately 10-20 micrometers thick, adheres to the wood''s cellular structure. This layer consists
    of fungal hyphae and particulate matter embedded within a matrix of degraded natural oils and resins.


    The underlying wood anatomy is partially visible but heavily soiled. The characteristic porous vessel elements and dense
    fiber cells are filled with fine, dark particulates, likely carbonaceous soot or embedded soil. The contamination follows
    the wood''s natural grain pattern, accumulating most heavily within the more porous earlywood regions, creating a topographically
    uneven surface that masks the native teak texture.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the native teak surface.
    The biological film and embedded particulate matter have been entirely removed through a process of selective laser ablation.
    The laser''s energy was preferentially absorbed by the contaminants, which have a lower thermal destruction threshold
    (~380°C) than the underlying wood.


    The cleaned surface now exhibits the open, cellular structure of teak wood with high fidelity. Vessel elements and fiber
    cell walls are clearly defined and free of occluding debris. The laser process has successfully cleared the porous structures
    without causing measurable carbonization or thermal degradation to the surrounding cellulose and lignin matrix. The result
    is a topographically accurate surface where the original wood grain and cellular detail are fully exposed and intact.'
