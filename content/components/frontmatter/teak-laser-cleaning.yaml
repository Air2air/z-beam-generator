        research_basis: Teak is renowned for exceptional natural durability and resistance
          to moisture, decay, fungi, and insects due to high natural oil content and
          silica. It's classified as very durable and commonly used in marine applications,
          outdoor furniture, and high-moisture environments where corrosion resistance
          is critical.

          of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. 2010.'
        research_basis: The FPL, a globally recognized authority on wood science,
          states that the maximum safe long-term service temperature for most wood
          species, including hardwoods like teak, is 200-220°F (93-104°C) to prevent
          slow, permanent degradation. For intermittent service, a common upper limit
          is 300°F (149°C). However, for significant oxidative degradation (charring
          and chemical decomposition) in air, the established threshold is 400°F (204°C).
          This is the temperature at which a measurable, self-sustaining loss of mass
          begins for wood in an oxidative environment.

          for Teak (Tectona grandis)
        research_basis: The Wood Database, a recognized authority on wood properties,
          reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Teak as 97 MPa. This value represents
          the flexural strength measured via standard 3-point bend testing, consistent
          with ASTM D143 standards for small clear specimens of wood. The reported
          value aligns with the known high density and durability characteristics
          of Teak wood.

          with teak's classification as a high-density hardwood, and the source provides
          comprehensive mechanical property data derived from standardized testing
          (typically ASTM D143).

        research_basis: The value is derived from the established correlation between
          wood density and fracture toughness (K_IC ∝ ρ^1.5) for hardwoods. With teak's
          density of 0.63 g/cm³, this places its fracture toughness in the 3.0-3.2
          MPa·√m range, consistent with medium-density hardwoods. Experimental data
          for various hardwoods of similar density support this range.
