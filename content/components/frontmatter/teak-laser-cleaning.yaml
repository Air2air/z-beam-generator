caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the teak surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulates, such as carbon soot and mineral dust, bound within a
    matrix of oxidized organic residues and degraded finish. The underlying wood grain is completely masked, with contaminants
    filling the porous vessel structures characteristic of teak's 55% porosity. The surface texture is irregular and crust-like,
    with fissures caused by differential thermal expansion between the contaminants and the wood substrate. This layer significantly
    alters the surface's thermal and optical properties, increasing its laser absorption and trapping moisture against the
    primary cell wall.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has successfully ablated the contamination layer, revealing the intact cellular structure of the
    teak wood. The original grain pattern is now fully visible, with open vessel elements and clear delineation between the
    dense summer growth and porous spring growth rings. The surface texture is restored to its native state, exhibiting minimal
    residual charring. The process has preserved the wood's structural integrity, removing only the superficial contaminants
    that occupied the porous network.
