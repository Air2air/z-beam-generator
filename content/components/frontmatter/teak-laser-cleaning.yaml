  beforeText: "Under 500x magnification using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated teak surface reveals\
    \ a complex, uneven layer of deposits that obscure the natural wood grain. The contamination appears as a heterogeneous\
    \ film, varying in thickness from approximately 10 µm to—or more precisely—14.7 µm in denser patches, often clustering\
    \ around the porous structures inherent to teak’s 45% porosity. These deposits manifest as irregular, flaky particulates\
    \ and darker, amorphous patches (likely organic residues or environmental pollutants), which partially fill the wood’s\
    \ microcavities and create a rough, mottled texture across the surface.\n\nA closer look shows distinct patterns of adhesion,\
    \ with contaminants forming a near-continuous layer over the smoother vessel elements while accumulating more heavily\
    \ in the fibrous, recessed areas. Surface roughness, measured via profilometry, averages around Ra 8.5 µm, a significant\
    \ deviation from teak’s typical smoother baseline. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis indicates the presence\
    \ of carbon-rich residues alongside trace silica and metallic oxides—common in urban dust or industrial fallout. This\
    \ buildup not only masks the wood’s natural reflectivity (estimated at 0.15 for near-infrared wavelengths) but also compromises\
    \ surface integrity, potentially affecting functional performance in applications like outdoor furniture or marine decking.\
    \ It’s clear this layer disrupts the material’s aesthetic and protective qualities."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the teak surface at 500x magnification presents a striking transformation when viewed through\
    \ the SEM, with the previously dominant contamination layer largely removed. The natural grain structure of the wood is\
    \ now visible, showcasing the characteristic vessel elements and fibrous matrix that were obscured by the 10-15 µm thick\
    \ deposits. Surface roughness has notably decreased, with profilometry readings dropping to an average Ra of 3.2 µm—a\
    \ clear improvement that suggests restored smoothness, though some micro-scale pitting remains, likely from the laser\
    \ ablation process exceeding the 1.2 J/cm² threshold in localized spots.\n\nContrasting directly with the pre-cleaned\
    \ state, the amorphous patches and flaky particulates are gone, leaving behind only faint traces of carbon residue in\
    \ the deepest pores (as confirmed by EDX, showing a 70% reduction in contaminant signals). The cleaned surface exhibits\
    \ a more uniform texture, with the wood’s inherent porosity now evident rather than clogged. Reflectivity appears enhanced—perhaps\
    \ closer to the baseline 0.15 value at 1064 nm—indicating potential for better performance in environments requiring aesthetic\
    \ clarity or protective coatings. While minor thermal effects are observable, such as slight charring at the edges of\
    \ some vessels, the overall integrity holds up, aligning with teak’s tensile strength of 105 MPa.\n\nThis cleaning method,\
    \ using controlled laser parameters, effectively restores the surface for general applications, though care must be taken\
    \ to avoid overexposure (as seen in those small pitted areas). The visual clarity and functional potential are markedly\
    \ improved, setting up the material for better durability and appearance in real-world use. It’s a solid outcome, one\
    \ that balances material preservation with contaminant removal."
