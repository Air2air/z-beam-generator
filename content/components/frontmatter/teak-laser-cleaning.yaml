subtitle: Teak contains unique natural oils and silica that protect it from the elements.
  These components require careful laser parameter adjustment to avoid damaging the

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the teak surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of embedded particulates, such as carbon soot and mineral dust, bound within a
    matrix of oxidized organic residues and degraded finish. The underlying wood grain
    is completely masked, with contaminants filling the porous vessel structures characteristic
    of teak's 55% porosity. The surface texture is irregular and crust-like, with
    fissures caused by differential thermal expansion between the contaminants and
    the wood substrate. This layer significantly alters the surface's thermal and
    optical properties, increasing its laser absorption and trapping moisture against
    the primary cell wall.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has successfully ablated the contamination layer, revealing
    the intact cellular structure of the teak wood. The original grain pattern is
    now fully visible, with open vessel elements and clear delineation between the
    dense summer growth and porous spring growth rings. The surface texture is restored
    to its native state, exhibiting minimal residual charring. The process has preserved
    the wood's structural integrity, removing only the superficial contaminants that
    occupied the porous network.
