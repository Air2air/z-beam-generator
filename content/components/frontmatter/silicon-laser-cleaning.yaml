caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from 1-10 µm in diameter, is scattered across the surface and embedded in a thin, amorphous film. This film, estimated at 50-200 nm thick, exhibits a mottled, textured appearance that scatters light and masks the underlying crystalline structure of the silicon substrate. The contaminants create a topographically complex landscape, with visible streaks and agglomerations that follow prior handling or processing directions.


    The inherent high reflectivity (38.5% at 1064nm) of the pristine silicon is significantly reduced by this layer. The contaminants disrupt the smooth surface, increasing diffuse scattering and creating localized points for potential electrical leakage or defect nucleation in subsequent manufacturing steps. This state is incompatible with the precision required for semiconductor device fabrication.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a transformative surface restoration. At 500x magnification, the contamination layer is entirely absent, revealing the pristine, planar silicon substrate. The surface is now uniform and smooth, with the characteristic features of the diamond cubic crystal structure becoming clearly visible. The previously obscured grain boundaries and atomic lattice orientation are now distinct.


    The removal of the light-scattering film restores the material''s intrinsic optical properties, resulting in a highly reflective surface with a consistent 38.5% reflectivity at 1064nm. All particulate embedment and amorphous residues have been eliminated, leaving a defect-free surface ready for subsequent processes like oxidation, etching, or thin-film deposition.'
