caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, measuring 0.5-2.0 µm in thickness, consists of
    particulate matter and hydrocarbon films. The underlying crystalline structure
    and polished finish are masked, with contaminants adhering in irregular patterns
    that increase surface roughness. This layer significantly alters the surface's
    optical and electronic properties, impeding performance.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic diamond cubic
    structure of the silicon substrate. The contamination layer is completely removed,
    restoring the original surface roughness of approximately 0.2 nm RMS. The surface
    now exhibits high reflectivity (38% at 1064 nm) and is free of ablation damage,
    confirming the process remained below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. This pristine
    state is essential for subsequent semiconductor processing steps.
