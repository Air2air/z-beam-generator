caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silicon surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. Particulate matter,
    ranging from sub-micron to over 5 micrometers in diameter, is scattered across the surface, appearing as distinct, opaque
    specks. These are embedded within a thinner, continuous film that adds a hazy, textured appearance to the underlying silicon.


    This film layer, estimated to be a few hundred nanometers thick, exhibits a mottled or streaked pattern, suggesting it
    was deposited unevenly. The contamination disrupts the native surface, increasing its microscopic roughness and masking
    the characteristic, uniform reflectivity of a pristine silicon wafer. The overall visual impression is of a topographically
    complex and optically non-uniform plane, rather than a clean semiconductor surface.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The particulate matter and the thin, hazy film
    have been completely removed, revealing the underlying silicon substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform, reflective
    appearance, with the characteristic crystalline structure of the silicon becoming clearly visible.


    The microscopic roughness has been significantly reduced, returning to a state consistent with a polished wafer. The previously
    obscured, smooth surface topography is now fully restored, with no visual evidence of residual contamination or laser-induced
    damage at this magnification. The cleaning process has successfully returned the surface to its essential, pristine condition.'
