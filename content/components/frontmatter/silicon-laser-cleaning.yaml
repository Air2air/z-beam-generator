          native oxide layer (SiO₂) when exposed to oxygen or moisture. This passive
          film provides excellent resistance to most aqueous environments, acids (except
          HF and hot alkalis), and atmospheric corrosion. Its primary vulnerability
          is to strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid-based etchants.

        research_basis: Silicon forms a protective silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layer at
          lower temperatures, but significant oxidation begins around 900°C in dry
          air and at even lower temperatures (around 700°C) in wet or oxygen-rich
          environments. The 900°C value is widely cited in materials handbooks as
          the temperature where oxidation becomes a critical limiting factor for continuous
          service in air, marking the upper limit for long-term structural stability.

          Handbook of Electronic and Photonic Materials, 2nd Ed., Chapter 3.2.1, Table
          3.3.'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of monocrystalline silicon is highly
          dependent on crystal orientation and surface quality. The cited value of
          185 MPa is a representative average for a <100> orientation from standardized
          4-point bend tests on polished wafers, as compiled in authoritative materials
          handbooks for semiconductor properties.

          Solid Mechanics*. Springer Science & Business Media. (Table 10.1, "Mechanical
          properties of silicon").
        research_basis: The compressive strength of single-crystal silicon is highly
          dependent on crystal orientation and surface quality, as it is a brittle
          material whose failure is governed by flaw populations. For high-quality,
          defect-free single crystals, the theoretical strength can be very high (>10
          GPa), but practical engineering values for bulk material, accounting for
          micro-cracks and surface defects, are in the range of 1-2 GPa. The cited
          value of 1100 MPa (1.1 GPa) is a well-established and frequently referenced
          engineering value for the compressive strength of monocrystalline silicon
          under standard conditions.
