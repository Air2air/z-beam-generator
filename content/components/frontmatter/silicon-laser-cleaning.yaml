caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from sub-micron to several microns
    in size, is scattered across the surface. A thin, amorphous film, estimated at
    50-200 nm thick, creates a hazy, textured appearance. This layer disrupts the
    native atomic-level smoothness of the polished wafer, increasing surface roughness
    to approximately 2-5 nm RMS. The contaminants form irregular patterns, including
    streaks and localized agglomerations, which would significantly interfere with
    subsequent lithographic or deposition processes.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the surface to its intrinsic state. At 500x,
    the contaminant film and particulates are entirely absent, revealing the underlying
    silicon crystal structure. The surface now exhibits the characteristic, near-atomic
    smoothness of a polished wafer, with a measured roughness of approximately 0.1
    nm RMS. The cleaning process effectively removes the obstructive layer without
    inducing micro-cracks or significant melting, preserving the wafer's mechanical
    integrity. This pristine surface is now optically clear and provides an ideal
    substrate for high-precision semiconductor fabrication steps.
