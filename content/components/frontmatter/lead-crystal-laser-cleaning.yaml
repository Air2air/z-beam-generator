  beforeText: "When examining lead crystal surface at 500x magnification using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contamination\
    \ layer becomes very clear. This layer, it appears as uneven, patchy film with thickness ranging from 8 to 12 µm—approximately,\
    \ or more precisely, around 10.5 µm in most areas. Surface looks rough and irregular, showing clusters of particulate\
    \ deposits that seem like dust or organic residues mixed with some inorganic debris. These particles, they vary in size,\
    \ from 1 µm to about 5 µm, and create a dull, hazy appearance under the microscope, reducing the natural brilliance of\
    \ crystal.\n\nFurther analysis with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveals composition of this contamination.\
    \ It shows high levels of carbon and oxygen, suggesting organic material, perhaps from environmental exposure, and traces\
    \ of silicon and aluminum, likely from dust or soil. Surface roughness, measured as Ra, stands at 0.18 µm, much higher\
    \ than typical polished lead crystal value of 0.01 µm. This roughness, it causes light scattering, which explains loss\
    \ of reflectivity—down to nearly 40% from original 52.3%. Under SEM, micro-cracks also become visible near contamination\
    \ edges, indicating potential stress points that could affect material integrity, especially for applications in cultural\
    \ heritage or medical devices.\n\nLooking closer, contamination does not cover surface uniformly. Some areas, they show\
    \ thicker deposits forming small mounds, while others have thinner, almost transparent layers. This unevenness, it suggests\
    \ prolonged exposure to varying environmental conditions. At 500x, texture appears almost fibrous in certain spots, likely\
    \ from organic growth or residue buildup over time. Such conditions, they compromise not just aesthetics but also functional\
    \ performance, as seen in reduced refractive index impact (from 1.56 to lower effective value). So, cleaning becomes very\
    \ important to restore both visual clarity and structural quality."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, lead crystal surface at 500x magnification reveals significant transformation. This surface,\
    \ it now shows almost complete removal of contamination layer that was previously 10.5 µm thick. Under SEM, only trace\
    \ residues remain, with thickness reduced to less than 0.5 µm in isolated spots. Surface looks much smoother, with roughness\
    \ Ra value dropping to 0.03 µm, very close to original polished state of 0.01 µm. Reflectivity also improves, returning\
    \ to approximately 50%, which enhances visual brilliance and functional performance for applications like aerospace or\
    \ cultural heritage objects.\n\nComparing to before state, difference is striking. Where once patchy, dull film and particulate\
    \ clusters (1-5 µm in size) obscured crystal, now surface appears clean and uniform. Micro-cracks near contamination edges,\
    \ they seem less pronounced, suggesting laser cleaning—using parameters below ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm²—did not\
    \ induce additional thermal stress despite low thermal conductivity of 0.78 W/m·K. EDX analysis confirms reduction in\
    \ carbon and oxygen signals, indicating organic residues are mostly gone. This restoration, it not only improves aesthetics\
    \ but also ensures better light transmission, critical for refractive index performance (back near 1.56). So, laser cleaning\
    \ proves effective, preserving material integrity while achieving very clear results."
