        research_basis: Lead crystal glass has poor chemical durability due to its
          high lead oxide content (typically 24-32%), making it susceptible to attack
          by acids, alkalis, and even atmospheric moisture over time. The lead ions
          readily leach out when exposed to corrosive environments, resulting in surface
          deterioration and loss of clarity. While resistant to dry air, its corrosion
          resistance is significantly inferior to borosilicate or soda-lime glasses
          in most environmental conditions.

        research_basis: Lead crystal glass is a soda-potash-lead-silicate composition.
          While it does not "oxidize" like a metal, its service temperature is limited
          by the thermal expansion and softening point. The lead oxide content (typically
          18-38%) begins to affect stability above 400°C, and this temperature is
          widely cited in glass manufacturing references as the maximum safe continuous
          service temperature to prevent structural degradation and potential lead
          leaching if cooled.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density 3.1 g/cm³, Mohs hardness
          ~4) are characteristic of high-lead crystal glass (24-32% PbO). Authoritative
          sources for glass properties, including the Corning Museum and glass engineering
          handbooks, consistently report the flexural strength for this glass family
          in the range of 30-40 MPa when measured by a 3-point or 4-point bend test.
          The value of 35 MPa is a representative median for annealed lead crystal.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with lead crystal glass. Authoritative materials handbooks report compressive
          strength for this material class as significantly higher than its tensile
          strength (which is typically 10-30 MPa). The cited source provides a compressive
          strength range of 50-70 MPa for lead glasses; the lower bound is given here
          as a conservative, well-supported estimate.
