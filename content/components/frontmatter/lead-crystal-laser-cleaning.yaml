subtitle: Lead crystal can be a real puzzle during laser treatment. Its varying density
  often leads to uneven heat distribution, so you’ve got to adjust power levels carefully
  to protect the delicate finish.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A carbonaceous soot deposit, approximately 5-10 µm thick,
    forms a discontinuous, amorphous film. This layer exhibits significant micro-cracking
    and adheres to the underlying substrate, masking the crystal's inherent surface
    texture and high refractive index (nd=1.56). Particulate matter, including silica
    and metal oxides, is embedded within this matrix, creating a topographically rough
    and optically scattering interface that degrades optical clarity and visual transmission.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, restoring the substrate's
    original morphology. The contaminant layer has been completely removed via selective
    laser ablation, revealing the pristine, homogeneous glass surface. At 500x, the
    lead crystal now displays its characteristic smooth texture, with no evidence
    of embedded particulates or micro-fractures. The surface's high reflectivity (52.3%)
    and low absorption (0.1%) are restored, maximizing light transmission and brilliance.
    The process successfully eliminated the contamination without inducing thermal
    stress damage, as confirmed by the absence of micro-cracking or surface melting,
    preserving the material's structural integrity and flexural strength of 45 MPa.
