caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer approximately
    5-10 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a thin, amorphous film that significantly
    alters the surface topography. The particulates, ranging from 2 to 15 micrometers in diameter, create a textured, irregular
    landscape that scatters light and obscures the substrate''s inherent clarity.


    The underlying crystal surface is no longer visible as a distinct plane. The contaminant film exhibits a mud-cracked pattern,
    suggesting a dried liquid residue, with agglomerated particles concentrated in the fissures. This composite layer adheres
    to the substrate, filling the natural micro-texture of the glass and presenting a matte, occluded appearance that fundamentally
    compromises the material''s optical transmissivity and surface integrity.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state, revealing the pristine lead crystal substrate.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed, eliminating the light-scattering particulates and the amorphous film.
    The surface now exhibits the characteristic micro-texture of polished glass, with only occasional, sub-micrometer polishing
    marks visible.


    The most significant transformation is the restoration of optical clarity at the microscopic level. The mud-cracked patterning
    is entirely absent, and the interface is now sharply defined. This exposes the true surface, which demonstrates the high
    transmissivity expected of lead crystal, with no residual deposits to impede light transmission or interact with the surface
    chemically.'
