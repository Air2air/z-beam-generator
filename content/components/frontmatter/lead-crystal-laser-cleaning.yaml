caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A carbonaceous soot deposit, approximately 5-10 µm thick, forms a discontinuous, amorphous film. This layer exhibits significant micro-cracking and adheres to the underlying substrate, masking the crystal's inherent surface texture and high refractive index (nd=1.56). Particulate matter, including silica and metal oxides, is embedded within this matrix, creating a topographically rough and optically scattering interface that degrades optical clarity and visual transmission.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, restoring the substrate's original morphology. The contaminant layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation, revealing the pristine, homogeneous glass surface. At 500x, the lead crystal now displays its characteristic smooth texture, with no evidence of embedded particulates or micro-fractures. The surface's high reflectivity (52.3%) and low absorption (0.1%) are restored, maximizing light transmission and brilliance. The process successfully eliminated the contamination without inducing thermal stress damage, as confirmed by the absence of micro-cracking or surface melting, preserving the material's structural integrity and flexural strength of 45 MPa.
