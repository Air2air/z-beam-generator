        research_basis: Inconel alloys (particularly Inconel 625 and 718) are nickel-chromium
          superalloys specifically designed for extreme corrosion resistance. They
          maintain excellent resistance to pitting, crevice corrosion, and stress
          corrosion cracking in various environments including seawater, chemical
          processing, and high-temperature applications. The high chromium content
          (typically 20-23%) provides outstanding oxidation resistance, placing it
          in the superior category for corrosion-resistant metals, though not quite
          at the perfect 10 level of some more specialized corrosion alloys.

        research_basis: For Inconel 600 (a common representative alloy), the maximum
          recommended continuous service temperature in air is 1093°C (2000°F) according
          to the primary manufacturer's datasheet. Other Inconel variants (like 601,
          617, 625) maintain good oxidation resistance up to 1093-1150°C, with 1093°C
          being the conservative baseline for continuous service before significant
          oxidation scaling occurs.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with Inconel 718, a common high-strength nickel-chromium alloy. The compressive
          yield strength for Inconel 718 at room temperature is authoritatively reported
          as 1034 MPa (150 ksi). This value is a standard reference in material data
          sheets for the alloy in the annealed condition.
