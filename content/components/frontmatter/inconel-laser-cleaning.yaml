caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Inconel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous soot, and salt deposits, forming a discontinuous, crust-like
    topography. The underlying alloy's fine grain structure and machining marks are
    completely masked. The surface exhibits high micro-roughness, with contamination
    filling the natural valleys of the substrate, creating a porous and mechanically
    weak interface.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, metallic Inconel substrate, with
    the contamination layer entirely removed. The original surface texture, including
    fine machining striations with an average roughness near 0.8 µm Ra, is now fully
    visible and unobstructed. The process exposes the material''s inherent fine-grained,
    face-centered cubic crystalline structure.


    The transformation eliminates the weak contamination interface, restoring a metallurgically
    pure surface. This results in a significant reduction in micro-roughness and the
    elimination of particulate entrapment sites. The cleaned surface exhibits uniform
    reflectivity, indicating the absence of non-metallic residues that could compromise
    subsequent processes like welding or coating adhesion. The base material''s integrity
    is preserved, with no evidence of melting or micro-cracking at this magnification.'
