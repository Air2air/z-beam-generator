caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the Inconel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded oxides and carbonaceous deposits, appearing as dark, amorphous patches
    that mask the underlying metal grain structure. The surface texture is highly irregular, with particulate matter scattered
    across a topographically complex landscape.


    The contamination does not form a continuous film but rather exhibits a cracked, island-like morphology. These islands
    create a stark contrast against the substrate, significantly altering the surface''s reflectivity and masking its intrinsic
    metallurgical features. The presence of this layer fundamentally changes the surface''s physical and chemical properties
    from those of the base Inconel alloy.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a complete transformation. The contamination layer is entirely
    absent, exposing the intact, undamaged Inconel substrate. The underlying metal grain structure is now clearly visible,
    presenting a uniform, clean surface with restored reflectivity.


    The process successfully removed all foreign material without inducing micro-cracking or melting, preserving the alloy''s
    original microstructure. The surface now exhibits the characteristic features of bare Inconel, free from the obscuring
    deposits previously observed.'
