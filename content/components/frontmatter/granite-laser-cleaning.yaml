subtitle: Granite's unique composition of interlocking crystals and varied mineral
  hardness creates a distinct surface profile. This requires careful calibration of
  laser parameters to effectively remove contaminants without affecting the stone's
  integrity.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 10-50 micrometers thick. This layer, composed
    of soot, biological growth, and mineral deposits, fills the natural micro-fissures
    and pits of the stone. The underlying crystalline structure of feldspar, quartz,
    and biotite is partially masked, with contaminants forming a cohesive, textured
    crust that alters the stone's intrinsic roughness and color.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination crust, revealing
    the pristine mineralogical microstructure. The original interlocking crystals
    of feldspar and quartz are now fully exposed, with their distinct cleavage planes
    and grain boundaries clearly visible. The surface exhibits restored micro-texture,
    with open pits and fissures free of foreign material, returning the granite to
    its native state.
