caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a dense, heterogeneous
    contamination layer averaging 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed of particulate
    matter, soot, and biological growth, fills the natural crystalline micro-texture.
    The surface appears matte and irregular, with contaminants adhering to grain boundaries
    and fissures, masking the stone's inherent mineralogical features.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the granite''s native micro-topography.
    The contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct, interlocking
    crystals of quartz, feldspar, and mica. The surface texture is now well-defined,
    with grain boundaries and micro-fissures clearly visible and free of foreign material.


    The process has effectively ablated contaminants without inducing macroscopic
    damage to the underlying mineral structure. The surface exhibits a clean, unaltered
    appearance, with the stone''s intrinsic porosity and crystalline reflectivity
    restored. This confirms the selective nature of the laser ablation process.'

subtitle: Granite presents a unique hurdle in laser cleaning due to its variable hardness
  across the surface. Adjust your controls carefully to around 50-70 watts, ensuring
  you preserve the stone’s natural texture during treatment.
