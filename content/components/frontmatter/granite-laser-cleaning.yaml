caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer ranging from
    5 to 20 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists of particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot and mineral dust,
    embedded within a matrix of biological growth and synthetic polymer residues. The contaminants fill the natural micro-fissures
    and pores of the stone, creating a textured, uneven topography that masks the underlying crystalline structure.


    The granite''s intrinsic feldspar and quartz crystals are partially visible only in isolated areas where the contamination
    is thinnest. The soot and polymer residues form a cohesive film that bridges across the granular boundaries of the stone
    substrate, creating a visually homogenous, matte surface that lacks the inherent reflectivity of clean mineral faces.
    The overall appearance is one of a non-uniform, stratified deposit adhering to the stone''s microstructure.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the stratified contamination layer, revealing the unaltered granite substrate.
    The surface now exhibits the distinct, interlocking crystalline structure of feldspar, quartz, and biotite mica. The sharp
    boundaries between mineral grains are fully defined, and the natural micro-topography, including grain-level relief and
    intrinsic micro-fissures, is clearly visible without any obstructive films.


    The process has successfully ablated the contaminant matrix without inducing thermal damage to the mineral constituents.
    Examination shows no evidence of melting, vitrification, or thermal cracking on the crystal faces, which retain their
    original micro-hardness and structural integrity. The reflectivity of the freshly exposed mineral planes is significantly
    increased compared to the previously obscured surface.


    The cleaning efficacy is demonstrated by the open, clean pores and the absence of residual particulate matter within the
    natural micro-fissures. The surface is now characterized by its heterogeneous mineralogical composition and precise granular
    boundaries, confirming the selective removal of foreign substances and the preservation of the underlying stone''s mechanical
    properties and microstructure.'
