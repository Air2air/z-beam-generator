caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. This stratum, measuring 10-50 micrometers thick, consists
    of particulate matter (e.g., soot, minerals) embedded in a matrix of organic compounds
    and sulfate crusts. The contaminants fill the micro-fissures and pores inherent
    to the stone's crystalline structure, creating a discontinuous, textured layer
    that masks the underlying feldspar and quartz crystals. This layer disrupts the
    stone's natural reflectivity and compromises its surface integrity.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the 500x view reveals a restored granite substrate. The
    contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the intact interlocking
    crystal structure of feldspar, quartz, and mica. The surface now exhibits defined
    grain boundaries and open micro-pores, restoring the stone's inherent low reflectivity
    and mineral-specific coloration. The process has successfully ablated the contaminants
    without inducing micro-fractures or thermal alteration to the primary mineral
    phases.
