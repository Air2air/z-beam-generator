caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This stratum consists
    of particulate matter (soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of organic compounds
    and sulfate crusts, which fills the natural micro-fissures and pores of the stone.
    The underlying crystalline structure of feldspar, quartz, and biotite is largely
    hidden. The contaminant layer exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate and creates
    an irregular, occluded surface texture that masks the granite's inherent granularity
    and compromises its structural interface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the granite's original micro-topography. The
    contaminant layer is entirely removed, revealing the distinct, interlocking crystals
    of quartz, feldspar, and mica. The surface now displays sharp grain boundaries
    and open, clean pores. This process re-exposes the substrate without mechanical
    abrasion, preserving the stone's intrinsic hardness and structural integrity at
    the microscopic level.
