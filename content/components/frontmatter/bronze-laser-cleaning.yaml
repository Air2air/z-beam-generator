  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the contaminated bronze surface reveals a complex, stratified layer of corrosion products and atmospheric deposits. A discontinuous crust of copper salts, primarily green basic copper sulfate (patina), covers the surface with a thickness ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers. This crust exhibits a porous, crystalline structure with fine, needle-like formations.\n\nBeneath this, a darker, more tenacious layer of cuprous oxide (cuprite) adheres directly to the metal substrate. The underlying bronze surface texture is completely obscured. The contamination is not uniform; it displays micro-cracking and localized pitting, indicating areas of active corrosion. Particulate matter, including carbonaceous soot and silica dust, is embedded within the porous matrix, contributing to the surface's rough, irregular topography."
  "afterText": "Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The stratified contamination layers have been completely removed, revealing the original, continuous bronze substrate. The surface now exhibits the fine, uniform grain structure of the alloy, with a measured roughness (Ra) reduced to approximately 0.8 micrometers.\n\nThe cleaning process has eliminated the porous crust and underlying oxide layer without abrasion or chemical residue. This exposes the true metal surface, characterized by its distinct metallic luster and the reappearance of fine, sub-micrometer machining marks that were previously obscured. The result is a clean, metallurgically pure surface ready for further analysis or protective coating."
