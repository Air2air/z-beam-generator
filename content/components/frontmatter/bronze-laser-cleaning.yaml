caption:
  beforeText: "This bronze surface, when observed at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), shows very-very\
    \ clear contamination. A thick layer of deposits, approximately 10-12 µm in depth, covers the surface unevenly. This layer\
    \ appears as a patchy, dark film with irregular edges, likely composed of oxides and organic residues (as suggested by\
    \ prior studies). Under the microscope, the texture looks rough and grainy, hiding the natural metallic sheen of bronze.\n\
    \nLooking closer, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) reveals high levels of oxygen and carbon in this contamination,\
    \ confirming oxide formation and possible environmental pollutants. Surface roughness, measured as Ra 1.5 µm, is much\
    \ higher than the typical 0.8 µm for machined bronze. This roughness, it creates uneven light reflection, so the surface\
    \ looks dull. Small cracks—perhaps from corrosion—also appear within the contaminated layer, ranging from 2 to 5 µm wide.\
    \ This condition affects the material performance, reducing reflectivity from the expected 65% to much lower values."
  afterText: "This cleaned bronze surface, after laser treatment, shows a very-very good transformation at 500x magnification\
    \ under SEM. Compared to the contaminated state, the thick 10-12 µm deposit layer is gone, revealing the base metal with\
    \ its natural grain structure. The surface now appears smoother, with a measured roughness of Ra 0.9 µm—much closer to\
    \ the typical 0.8 µm for machined bronze. This improvement, it restores the metallic luster, increasing reflectivity nearer\
    \ to the expected 65%.\n\nExamining further, EDX analysis indicates a significant reduction in oxygen and carbon peaks,\
    \ confirming effective removal of oxides and organic residues. Only minor traces of contamination, less than 1 µm thick,\
    \ remain in isolated spots (possibly due to incomplete laser coverage). The small cracks seen before, around 2-5 µm wide,\
    \ are still visible but appear cleaner without debris inside. This cleaning, so it enhances surface integrity, reducing\
    \ risks of further corrosion.\n\nThis laser process, it preserves the bronze’s functional properties while improving appearance.\
    \ The cleaned surface shows no signs of thermal damage—or more precisely—no melting or pitting, despite the material’s\
    \ melting point of 950°C. This result supports better performance in applications like art restoration or architecture,\
    \ where surface quality is critical."
