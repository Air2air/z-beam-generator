        research_basis: Bronze (copper-tin alloys) exhibits good general corrosion
          resistance, particularly in marine atmospheres and against seawater, outperforming
          steel and many other metals. However, it is susceptible to specific corrosive
          agents like ammonia and some acids, placing it below more specialized alloys
          like stainless steels in comprehensive corrosion resistance.

        research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for bronze is not a single
          fixed point but a range. For continuous service in air, a conservative maximum
          is typically 260°C (500°F) for many standard tin bronzes. While brief exposure
          to higher temperatures is possible, significant oxidation begins above this
          temperature, leading to the formation of non-protective oxide scales (primarily
          CuO and SnO2). This value is a general guideline for common bronze alloys;
          specific compositions (e.g., aluminum bronzes) can have significantly higher
          resistance.

          and Special-Purpose Materials," ASM International, 10th edition, page 398.'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of bronze is not a single fixed value
          but varies significantly with the specific alloy composition and temper.
          For common cast or wrought bronze alloys (e.g., C90500, C51000), typical
          flexural strength values range from approximately 200 MPa to over 600 MPa.
          The cited value of 310 MPa is a representative mid-range figure for a medium-strength
          bronze alloy like C83600 (leaded red brass) or C90500 (tin bronze) in a
          sand-cast or extruded condition, based on standardized 3-point bend test
          data from the authoritative ASM Handbook.

          and Special-Purpose Materials" (ASM International, 10th edition)'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of bronze is not a single fixed value
          but varies significantly with the specific alloy composition (e.g., tin
          content, presence of aluminum, lead, or phosphorus) and its temper (e.g.,
          cast, annealed, or hard). For common cast tin bronzes (e.g., UNS C90500),
          the compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) typically ranges from 125 MPa
          (annealed) to over 550 MPa (hard). The value of 250 MPa is a representative,
          conservative estimate for a medium-strength, commonly used bronze alloy
          in an "as-cast" or annealed condition. The provided material properties
          (density, hardness) are consistent with this class of alloys.
