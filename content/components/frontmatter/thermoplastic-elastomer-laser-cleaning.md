title: Thermoplastic Elastomer Laser Cleaning
headline: Comprehensive technical guide for laser cleaning composite thermoplastic
  elastomer
description: Laser cleaning of TPE utilizes precise nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers
  to selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the underlying polymer
  matrix. The process exploits differential absorption between contaminants and the
  TPE substrate, achieving non-contact cleaning with micron-level precision and no
  solvent waste.
