caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the breccia surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick,
    adheres to the stone matrix. This crust is a composite of particulate matter,
    black gypsum crusts, and biological growth, filling the natural porosity and interlocking
    clasts. The underlying breccia texture—a key visual characteristic—is largely
    hidden, with only the highest mineral protrusions visible through the deposit.
    The contaminants form a cohesive, low-porosity layer that masks the stone's inherent
    color and granular detail.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively restored the breccia's micro-topography.
    The contamination crust is entirely removed, revealing the distinct boundaries
    between the constituent clasts and the cementing matrix. The stone's natural porosity
    (approximately 8%) and granular texture are now fully visible, with no thermal
    damage or alteration to the mineral components. The surface exhibits its original
    heterogeneous composition, with clear differentiation between the various rock
    fragments.

subtitle: Breccia’s uneven composition often poses a real hurdle during laser treatment.
  Pay close attention to power adjustments, as even a slight mismatch can affect the
  finish, and that’s very-very critical for consistent results.
