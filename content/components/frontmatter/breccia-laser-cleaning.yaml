caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the breccia surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of particulate
    matter, black sulfation crusts, and biological growth, fills the natural porosity
    and microfractures of the stone. The original clastic texture and mineralogical
    contrast between the angular fragments (clasts) and the finer-grained matrix are
    masked. The surface exhibits a caked, irregular topography that compromises the
    stone's intrinsic visual and structural character.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the complete removal of the contamination
    layer, restoring the breccia's authentic microstructure. The sharp boundaries
    of the individual clasts and the intricate, porous network of the cementing matrix
    are now fully exposed. The surface texture is clean and well-defined, with no
    residual crusts or microfracture blockages, confirming the precise, substrate-preserving
    nature of the laser ablation process.
