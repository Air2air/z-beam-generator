caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the breccia surface is obscured by a continuous,
    heterogeneous contamination layer averaging 15-25 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, fills the natural
    porosity and fractures. It creates a matte, occluded texture that masks the stone's
    inherent mineralogical composition and interlocking clast structure.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the breccia's intrinsic fabric. The
    contamination layer is removed, exposing clean, individual mineral grains and
    the sharp boundaries of constituent clasts. The stone's original micro-topography
    and porosity are fully restored, with no thermal alteration to the substrate.
