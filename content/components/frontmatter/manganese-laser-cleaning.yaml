caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the manganese surface shows a non-uniform oxide layer approximately 5-10 micrometers
    thick. This layer appears as a dark, mottled crust with a complex crystalline structure, composed primarily of manganese
    oxides (MnO and Mn₃O₄). The surface texture is rough and porous, with visible micro-cracks and granular deposits that
    obscure the underlying metal grain structure.


    The contamination layer exhibits poor adhesion in localized areas, creating pockets of delamination. Particulate contaminants,
    likely from environmental exposure, are embedded within the oxide matrix, further increasing surface roughness. The overall
    topography is highly irregular, with peak-to-valley variations exceeding 15 micrometers, which would negatively affect
    any subsequent coating or bonding processes.'
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface is transformed to reveal the base manganese microstructure. The dark oxide
    crust is entirely removed, exposing a uniform metallic surface with clearly defined grain boundaries. The previous 5-10
    micrometer contamination layer is eliminated, reducing the peak-to-valley surface roughness to under 2 micrometers. The
    cleaned surface now presents a consistent, oxide-free substrate suitable for further processing.
