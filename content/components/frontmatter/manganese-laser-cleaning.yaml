caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the manganese surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of adherent
    oxide scales, primarily MnO and Mn3O4, appearing as a matte, dark grey crust.
    The underlying metallic surface texture is completely masked. Particulate contaminants
    are embedded within this brittle oxide matrix, creating a rough, discontinuous
    topography with visible micro-cracks that propagate into the substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native metallic surface, revealing the
    fine-grained, polycrystalline structure of the α-Mn phase. The tenacious oxide
    layer and embedded particulates have been completely removed via ablation, eliminating
    the micro-cracks and leaving a uniform, light-grey metallic finish. The process
    reduces average surface roughness (Ra) significantly, exposing the material's
    intrinsic grain boundaries and subtle polishing marks from the original fabrication,
    with no measurable thermal damage to the underlying microstructure.
