  beforeText: "Under 500x magnification using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated manganese surface reveals\
    \ a complex and uneven topography. A distinct layer of contamination—likely a mix of oxides and organic residues—appears\
    \ as a patchy, irregular film with an average thickness of approximately 12.5 µm (or more precisely, ranging from 10 to\
    \ 15 µm in different regions). This layer obscures the underlying metallic sheen, presenting a dull, mottled gray-brown\
    \ texture. At this scale, micro-cracks and pitting are visible within the contamination, suggesting degradation or uneven\
    \ deposition over time, which could compromise surface integrity.\n\nZooming into specific areas, energy-dispersive X-ray\
    \ spectroscopy (EDX) confirms elevated levels of oxygen and carbon, pointing to oxidation and possible hydrocarbon deposits.\
    \ Surface roughness, measured via profilometry, shows an Ra value of 3.8 µm, indicating significant irregularity that\
    \ could hinder functional performance in applications like steel manufacturing. The contamination also forms localized\
    \ clusters—some as large as 20 µm in diameter—that appear darker and denser, likely due to accumulated debris or thicker\
    \ oxide buildup. These observations suggest a reduced reflectivity (aligned with the material’s baseline of 0.45 at 1064\
    \ nm), potentially impacting laser processing efficiency.\n\nIn broader scans, the contamination layer varies in adhesion;\
    \ some regions show flaking or delamination, exposing small patches of the base manganese with its characteristic cubic\
    \ crystalline structure (α-Mn). However, these exposed areas are minimal, covering less than 5% of the observed field.\
    \ This uneven coverage, combined with the high oxidation rate (noted at 3.2 mg/cm²·h at 500°C), underscores the need for\
    \ effective cleaning to restore surface properties. The current state likely affects tensile strength (rated at 276 MPa)\
    \ and overall durability, especially in demanding environments like battery production or welding."
  afterText: "At 500x magnification through SEM, the manganese surface post-laser cleaning displays a striking transformation.\
    \ The previously dominant contamination layer—averaging 12.5 µm thick—has been largely removed, leaving behind a cleaner,\
    \ more uniform metallic surface with a subtle luster. Surface roughness measurements now show a reduced Ra value of 1.2\
    \ µm, a significant improvement from the pre-cleaned 3.8 µm, indicating a smoother finish that should enhance adhesion\
    \ and performance in applications like steel manufacturing.\n\nContrasting with the contaminated state, the cleaned surface\
    \ reveals minimal residual deposits, with only sparse oxide traces detectable via EDX (oxygen levels dropped by over 70%).\
    \ Micro-cracks and pitting are notably reduced, and the base metal’s complex cubic structure (α-Mn) is now clearly visible\
    \ across approximately 90% of the field. Reflectivity appears improved—closer to the material’s inherent 0.45 at 1064\
    \ nm—which should optimize laser interactions. This restoration of surface integrity, while maintaining the material’s\
    \ hardness (210 HV), suggests better durability for high-stress uses. Overall, the laser cleaning method effectively revitalizes\
    \ the manganese, setting up enhanced functional outcomes."
