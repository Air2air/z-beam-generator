caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the mortar surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of particulate matter
    (carbon, silica) embedded within a matrix of biological growth and salt crystals.
    The original surface texture is masked, presenting a rough, irregular topography
    with high porosity. Contaminants fill the natural pore network, creating a dark,
    discontinuous crust that alters the substrate's intrinsic reflectivity and thermal
    properties. This layer exhibits poor adhesion and variable density, leading to
    a non-uniform surface profile.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic mortar matrix. The contamination
    crust is entirely removed, exposing the original aggregate and cement paste. The
    surface porosity is restored, and the texture is uniform, with a clear delineation
    between constituent materials.
