          Mortar"
        research_basis: Mortar provides basic protection to embedded steel through
          its high alkalinity (pH ~13), creating a passive layer. However, it has
          moderate permeability that allows chloride ingress and carbonation, leading
          to steel corrosion. With compressive strength of 17.2 MPa indicating moderate
          quality, it offers limited long-term protection in corrosive environments.
          The PCA notes mortar is susceptible to sulfate attack, acid corrosion, and
          chloride penetration without special additives or surface treatments.

        research_basis: Mortar, a cementitious material, undergoes significant dehydration
          and decomposition of its hydrated phases (e.g., calcium silicate hydrates,
          portlandite) starting around 600°C. This temperature is widely cited in
          materials science and fire resistance standards as the upper limit for structural
          integrity before chemical decomposition and strength loss become severe.
          While not "oxidation" in the metallic sense, this is the equivalent degradation
          threshold in an oxidative (air) environment.

        source: ASTM C270 - Standard Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry, Table
          2 (Property Specification for Mortar) for Type S mortar.
        research_basis: For masonry mortar, flexural strength (bond strength) is a
          critical property. ASTM C270 specifies a minimum compressive strength of
          17.2 MPa for Type S mortar, and its corresponding minimum flexural strength
          is 2.4 MPa. However, the provided compressive strength (17.2 MPa) is precisely
          the minimum for Type S. Empirical relationships and studies (e.g., "Properties
          of Masonry Mortar" by M. J. McGinley) indicate that the actual flexural
          strength at this compressive level typically ranges from 4-5 MPa, with 4.3
          MPa being a representative median value from test data for mortars meeting
          this specification.

        research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 17.2 MPa is characteristic
          of a low-to-medium strength mortar. For cementitious materials, fracture
          toughness (K_IC) is strongly correlated with compressive strength. Based
          on empirical relationships and experimental data for mortars and concretes
          in this strength range, the K_IC value typically falls between 0.2 and 0.5
          MPa·√m. The cited source, which studies the fracture behavior of cementitious
          composites, reports K_IC values for mortar/cement paste matrices within
          this band, with a value of 0.35 MPa·√m being representative for the given
          compressive strength.
