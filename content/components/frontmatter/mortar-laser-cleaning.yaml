caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the mortar surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer approximately 50-200
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including carbon spherules from pollution and mineral dust,
    embedded in a dark, amorphous matrix of organic compounds. The surface texture is highly irregular, with contaminants
    filling the natural pores and valleys of the mortar.


    The contamination forms a discontinuous crust, creating a visual barrier that masks the underlying material''s true composition
    and texture. This crust exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate in some areas, showing micro-fractures and delamination.
    The original granular aggregate and cementitious matrix of the mortar are largely concealed, with only the highest topographic
    features partially visible through the contaminant film.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete transformation. The contamination
    crust has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic mortar microstructure. The original surface texture, characterized
    by a heterogeneous mix of sand aggregates and the cementitious binding matrix, is now fully visible and intact.


    The material''s inherent porosity, with pore sizes ranging from 10-50 micrometers, is clearly evident and free of堵塞. A
    direct comparison shows no thermal damage to the mineral constituents; the aggregate particles and cement paste retain
    their original microstructural integrity. The cleaning process has successfully ablated only the contamination layer,
    restoring the authentic surface without mechanical alteration.'
