description: Technical overview of Cherry wood for laser cleaning. Cherry, a hardwood
  known for its rich color and fine grain, is suitable for laser cleaning due to its
  ability to withstand the thermal effects of the process. The laser cleaning of Cherry
  wood involves precise removal of contaminants and old finishes while preserving
  the wood's integrity, making it ideal for applications in furniture manufacturing
  and restoration.
