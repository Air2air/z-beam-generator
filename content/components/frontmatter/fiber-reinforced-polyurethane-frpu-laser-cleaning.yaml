caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contaminant layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and amorphous carbonaceous deposits, masks the underlying composite
    texture. The original 1.2 µm Ra surface roughness is amplified, creating deep
    valleys that trap further contamination and disrupt the material's intended topography.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively removes the contaminant layer, restoring the
    native FRPU surface. The underlying fiber reinforcement and polyurethane matrix
    are now fully exposed and undamaged. The process returns the surface to its intrinsic
    1.2 µm Ra roughness, eliminating residue and revealing a clean, well-defined composite
    morphology.
