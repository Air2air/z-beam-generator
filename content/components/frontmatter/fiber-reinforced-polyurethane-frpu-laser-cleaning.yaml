caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and a carbonaceous film, masks the underlying composite texture.
    The contaminants form irregular, dendritic patterns that follow the micro-topography,
    filling the valleys of the original 1.2 µm Ra surface roughness. This coverage
    significantly alters the material's surface energy and optical properties, increasing
    light scattering and reducing functional performance.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native FRPU topography. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct, undulating texture of the
    fiber-reinforced composite matrix. The original surface roughness of approximately
    1.2 µm Ra is now fully exposed, with no evidence of thermal degradation or fiber
    damage. The surface exhibits uniform laser absorption characteristics, indicating
    a pristine, performance-ready state.
