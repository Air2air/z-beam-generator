subtitle: The composite layers in FRPU can absorb energy differently, so a stable, mid-range power setting is your best approach. This prevents the resin from overheating while still effectively stripping surface contaminants.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically measuring 5-20 micrometers thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate, hydrocarbon films, and microbial growth, which mask the underlying composite structure. The contamination disrupts the intended surface texture, filling the micro-valleys between fiber bundles and polyurethane matrix. This creates an irregular topography that can interfere with adhesion and surface-sensitive processes.
  afterText: Laser cleaning selectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring the original FRPU topography. The cleaned surface reveals distinct fiber bundles and the polyurethane matrix with minimal substrate alteration. This results in a surface free of obscuring films, with its intrinsic micro-texture fully exposed for optimal performance.
