caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the FRPU surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists
    of embedded particulate matter and a film of organic residues, which clogs the
    material''s inherent micro-porosity (typically 2.5%). The particulates, ranging
    from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, are firmly adhered within the polyurethane
    matrix.


    The original surface texture, with an average roughness (Ra) of 1.2 µm, is no
    longer distinct. The contaminant film creates a smeared, topographically flat
    appearance that masks the underlying composite structure. This layer exhibits
    poor adhesion to the FRPU in some areas, showing micro-cracks and delamination,
    which indicates a weak boundary layer susceptible to removal.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, restoring
    the native FRPU topography. The underlying composite structure is now fully visible,
    with the original 1.2 µm Ra surface roughness re-established. The process has
    successfully cleared all particulate matter from the porosity without inducing
    thermal damage to the polyurethane matrix, which has a softening point of 180°C.
    The surface is contamination-free.
