  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated fiberglass surface reveals a complex, non-uniform layer of foreign
    material. This contamination layer, measuring between 5-15 micrometers thick, appears as a discontinuous film of organic
    residues and embedded particulate matter. The underlying fiberglass weave pattern is partially obscured, with the contaminant
    accumulating preferentially in the microscopic valleys of the 1.2 µm Ra surface texture.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like morphology, suggesting a dried polymer or composite substance. Particulates,
    ranging from 2-10 µm in diameter, are firmly adhered within this matrix. The presence of this layer significantly alters
    the surface''s optical properties, increasing light scattering and masking the characteristic glass fiber and resin microstructure.
    This obscuration prevents accurate assessment of the substrate''s true condition.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, restoring the original fiberglass substrate. The
    surface now displays the distinct, undamaged weave pattern of the glass fibers and the surrounding polymer matrix with
    high fidelity. The characteristic 1.2 µm Ra micro-roughness of the molded composite is fully exposed and uniform, with
    no evidence of embedded particulate or residual film. This confirms the selective nature of the process, which ablated
    the contaminant without exceeding the material's 1.8 J/cm² damage threshold.
