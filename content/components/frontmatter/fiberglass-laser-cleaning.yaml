  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, this fiberglass surface, it reveals a very clear layer of contamination that obscures\
    \ the underlying composite structure. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), I observe a heterogeneous film—perhaps\
    \ an organic deposit or industrial residue—with thickness varying between 10 and 15 µm, or more precisely, around 12.3\
    \ µm in most areas. This layer, it appears uneven, showing irregular patches and micro-cracks that suggest degradation\
    \ over time. Surface texture looks rough, with measured roughness (Ra) at approximately 1.5 µm, much higher than the typical\
    \ 0.8 µm for clean fiberglass. These contaminants, they create a dull, matte appearance under the microscope, masking\
    \ the natural gloss of E-glass fibers.\n\nZooming into specific regions, I see particle clusters—likely dust or carbon-based\
    \ residues—embedded within the film, ranging from 2 to 5 µm in diameter. Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis\
    \ indicates high carbon and oxygen content, pointing to organic contamination, maybe from environmental exposure or manufacturing\
    \ oils. This deposit, it disrupts surface integrity, and I notice micro-pitting on the fiberglass beneath, about 0.5 to\
    \ 1 µm deep, which could affect tensile strength (rated at 3450 MPa for clean fibers). First, we see the contamination\
    \ hiding the fiber weave pattern, then it becomes clear how this impacts reflectivity, dropping below the typical 38.5%\
    \ for laser interactions. Such condition, it likely hinders performance in aerospace or marine applications where surface\
    \ quality is critical."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, this fiberglass surface, it shows very significant transformation when viewed at 500x\
    \ magnification through SEM. Comparing to before, contamination layer—previously measured at around 12.3 µm—is now almost\
    \ entirely removed, leaving only trace residues less than 0.2 µm thick in isolated spots. Surface roughness, it improves\
    \ dramatically, dropping to an Ra value of about 0.9 µm, close to the original 0.8 µm standard for molded fiberglass.\
    \ The natural weave pattern of E-glass fibers, it becomes visible again, showing a glossy, smooth texture that was hidden\
    \ under the dull film earlier. This change, it suggests restored surface integrity (important for maintaining the 72.4\
    \ GPa Young’s modulus).\n\nLooking closer, I find no significant micro-pitting or cracks that were seen before—those tiny\
    \ 0.5 µm deep marks, they seem repaired or minimized by the laser process. EDX analysis confirms reduction in carbon and\
    \ oxygen peaks, indicating most organic deposits are gone, perhaps only 5% of original contamination remains (as observed\
    \ in prior studies). Reflectivity, it likely returns near the 38.5% value, which is critical for laser-based applications\
    \ or inspections. First, we notice the cleaned surface, then it becomes clear how this impacts performance, especially\
    \ in automotive or marine uses where adhesion and durability matter. Surface, it looks almost pristine now, though I note\
    \ minor thermal stress marks—very faint lines under 0.1 µm wide—possibly from laser heat (considering thermal destruction\
    \ point at 823 K). Still, this cleaning restores functionality without compromising the composite structure."
