        research_basis: Borosilicate glass exhibits exceptional chemical durability
          against water, acidic solutions, and saline solutions, with very low corrosion
          rates. It shows excellent resistance to all acids except hydrofluoric acid
          and phosphoric acid. Alkaline solutions cause slightly higher corrosion
          rates, but still significantly lower than ordinary soda-lime glass. This
          high chemical inertness qualifies it for laboratory and industrial applications
          where corrosion resistance is critical.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for borosilicate
          glass (e.g., Corning Pyrex 7740) is consistently cited as 500°C by major
          manufacturers and technical data sheets. This is the temperature limit for
          long-term use before thermal creep or structural degradation begins, which
          serves as a practical upper limit for oxidation resistance in an air atmosphere.

          Materials, typical values for borosilicate glass from 3-point bend tests.
        research_basis: Borosilicate glass, while strong in compression, is a brittle
          material with a flexural strength highly dependent on surface quality and
          test conditions. Authoritative technical datasheets and materials science
          references (e.g., Corning, Schott) consistently report a typical flexural
          strength in the range of 50-70 MPa for laboratory-scale tests on pristine
          specimens. The value of 60 MPa is a representative median for a 3-point
          bend test, though real-world strength is often lower due to microscopic
          surface flaws.

        research_basis: Borosilicate glass compressive strength typically ranges from
          280-650 MPa depending on specific composition and surface quality. The lower
          end (280 MPa) represents a conservative, widely cited value for annealed
          laboratory borosilicate glass (e.g., Pyrex, Duran) from manufacturer technical
          data sheets. Higher values up to 650 MPa apply to pristine, flaw-free specimens
          under ideal laboratory conditions.
