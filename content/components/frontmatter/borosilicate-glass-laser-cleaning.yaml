caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the borosilicate glass surface is obscured by
    a discontinuous contamination layer, typically measuring 1-5 micrometers in thickness.
    This layer consists of particulate matter, such as dust and skin cells, embedded
    in a matrix of organic residues like oils or fingerprints. The underlying glass,
    with its characteristic amorphous structure, is partially visible through cracks
    and thinner areas in this film.


    The contamination adheres to the native surface, which has a baseline roughness
    of approximately 0.5 nm Ra. The particulates create localized topographical features,
    disrupting the substrate''s inherent smoothness. This heterogeneous layer scatters
    light, significantly reducing optical transmission and creating a hazy, diffuse
    appearance that compromises the material''s functional clarity for scientific
    applications.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a surface that is virtually indistinguishable
    from pristine borosilicate glass at 500x magnification. The contamination layer
    has been completely removed via selective laser ablation, which occurs at energy
    densities above the 2.5 J/cm² threshold but well below the material''s 15 J/cm²
    damage limit. The original amorphous surface topography is fully restored.


    The post-processed surface exhibits the native 0.5 nm Ra smoothness, with no evidence
    of micro-fractures or thermal etching. The removal of the light-scattering contamination
    layer restores maximum optical transmission and clarity. The process successfully
    eliminates all foreign material without altering the substrate''s chemical or
    structural integrity, resulting in a surface ideal for high-performance applications.'
