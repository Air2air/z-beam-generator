caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the borosilicate glass surface is obscured by
    a discontinuous layer of particulate and film-based contamination. This layer,
    ranging from 0.5 to 5 micrometers in thickness, consists of fine dust, organic
    residues, and water stains. The contaminants disrupt the native surface, creating
    a textured, irregular topography that scatters light and significantly reduces
    optical clarity. The underlying glass substrate is no longer uniformly smooth,
    with contamination adhering to micro-fissures and surface defects.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine borosilicate substrate. The surface
    at 500x magnification is now uniform and smooth, with the characteristic atomic-level
    roughness of the native glass. All light-scattering contaminants have been removed,
    revealing the substrate's inherent optical homogeneity and restoring maximum light
    transmissivity.
