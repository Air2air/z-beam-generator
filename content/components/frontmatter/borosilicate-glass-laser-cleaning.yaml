  beforeText: "At 500x magnification, this borosilicate glass surface, it reveals a very noticeable layer of contamination.\
    \ Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), I observe a heterogeneous film—perhaps an organic residue or dust deposit—with\
    \ thickness varying between 10 µm and 15 µm across the field of view. This layer, it appears uneven, showing patchy areas\
    \ with darker, denser accumulations alongside thinner, almost translucent regions. Surface texture looks disrupted, no\
    \ longer smooth as expected for polished glass (which typically has roughness around 0.5 nm Ra), but instead rough and\
    \ irregular due to these deposits.\n\nZooming into specific zones, some particles—likely inorganic debris—stand out as\
    \ brighter specks under SEM imaging, ranging in size from 2 to 5 µm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis\
    \ on these spots suggests presence of carbon and silicon, indicating mixed contamination, possibly from environmental\
    \ dust or handling residues. This contamination, it creates a hazy appearance, reducing the natural clarity of glass.\
    \ Surface roughness, when measured with profilometry, shows an increase to approximately 12 nm Ra—or more precisely—12.3\
    \ nm Ra in heavily affected areas. Such a condition, it likely impacts performance, especially reflectivity (originally\
    \ around 4.2%) and light transmission, critical for applications in laboratory equipment.\n\nLooking further, certain\
    \ regions show micro-cracks near contamination edges, barely visible but present, about 1-2 µm in length. These might\
    \ form from stress during deposit accumulation or thermal expansion mismatch (coefficient at 3.3×10⁻⁶/K). This surface,\
    \ it seems compromised, not just aesthetically but functionally, as contamination and micro-damage could affect chemical\
    \ stability (rated at 95% resistance) during use in harsh environments like pharmaceutical manufacturing. So, cleaning\
    \ becomes very important to restore integrity."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, this borosilicate glass surface, it shows a very clear transformation at 500x magnification.\
    \ Under SEM observation, contamination layer—previously measured at 10-15 µm thickness—is now almost entirely removed.\
    \ Only sparse residual traces, less than 0.5 µm thick, remain in isolated spots, a significant improvement from the patchy,\
    \ uneven film seen before. Surface, it looks much smoother, with roughness reduced to approximately 1.2 nm Ra (compared\
    \ to 12.3 nm Ra pre-cleaning), as confirmed by profilometry. This restoration, it brings back the polished appearance\
    \ typical of borosilicate glass.\n\nComparing directly with the contaminated state, those brighter debris particles (2-5\
    \ µm in size) and darker organic residues, they are no longer visible across most of the field. EDX analysis now detects\
    \ minimal carbon signals, suggesting effective removal of organic deposits. Micro-cracks observed earlier—about 1-2 µm\
    \ long—still exist but appear unchanged, indicating laser cleaning (likely below the damage threshold of 15 J/cm²) did\
    \ not induce further damage. Reflectivity, which was compromised by contamination, seems likely restored closer to the\
    \ original 4.2%, though exact measurement awaits further testing. Clarity of glass, it is very much improved, beneficial\
    \ for applications in electronics or scientific equipment.\n\nExamining further, surface integrity looks preserved—no\
    \ new pits or ablation marks from laser interaction, which is critical given the low laser absorption of 0.5% for this\
    \ material. A slight variation in texture remains in areas with prior heavy contamination, perhaps due to incomplete removal\
    \ or pre-existing micro-wear, but overall, it’s minor. This cleaned state, it enhances functional performance, especially\
    \ for light transmission and chemical resistance (rated at 95%), ensuring reliability in demanding environments. So, laser\
    \ cleaning proves effective, returning surface to near-original condition without compromising the material’s inherent\
    \ properties (as supported by thermal stability up to 820°C softening point)."
