description: Zinc, represented by the chemical symbol Zn, is a versatile metal widely
  used in industries such as automotive and electronics. Its properties make it suitable
  for laser cleaning applications, particularly for removing rust and corrosion from
  zinc-coated parts and precision cleaning of zinc components in circuit boards. The
  use of lasers with a wavelength of 1064nm and a fluence range of 1.0–10 J/cm² allows
  for effective ablation and cleaning of zinc surfaces without damaging the underlying
  material.
