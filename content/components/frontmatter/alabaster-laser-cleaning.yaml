caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. This stratum, measuring 5-15 micrometers thick, consists
    of particulate matter (carbon soot, silica dust) embedded within a matrix of sulfated
    calcites and organic residues from environmental exposure. The underlying stone''s
    micro-topography is entirely masked.


    The contamination adheres tenaciously within the natural porosity of the alabaster,
    which averages 8.5%. This occludes the stone''s intrinsic translucency and sub-micrometer
    surface texture. The layer exhibits micro-fracturing, but its overall cohesion
    prevents the underlying, softer alabaster (Mohs 2.0) from being accessed by conventional,
    contact-based cleaning methods without risk of mechanical abrasion.'
  afterText: 'Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the pristine alabaster substrate.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed via ablation, exposing the
    original micro-crystalline structure. The stone''s inherent porosity and grain
    boundaries are now clearly visible and free of foreign deposits.


    The laser process has selectively vaporized contaminants, which have a lower ablation
    threshold than the alabaster itself. This results in a clean, mineralogical surface
    without altering the substrate''s mechanical integrity. The stone''s natural translucency
    and fine texture are restored, confirming the non-abrasive and precise nature
    of the cleaning intervention.'
