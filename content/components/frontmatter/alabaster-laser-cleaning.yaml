caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. A discontinuous crust of inorganic
    particulates (e.g., soot, dust) adheres to a deeper, consolidated matrix of organic
    matter and salts. This layer masks the stone's intrinsic translucency and micro-crystalline
    structure. The contaminants fill the natural porosity and intergranular boundaries,
    creating a rough, occluded surface texture that promotes further degradation.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively removed the stratified contamination
    layer, revealing the pristine, micro-crystalline substrate. The original grain
    boundaries and interlocking crystal structure of the gypsum are now fully exposed
    and clearly defined. Surface porosity has been restored to its natural state,
    with no evidence of residual crust or particulate matter embedded within the pore
    network.


    The process has achieved selective ablation, precisely removing contaminants at
    their adhesion points without damaging the underlying stone. This is confirmed
    by the intact crystal facets and the absence of thermal artifacts, such as melting
    or discoloration, which would indicate exceeding the material''s dehydration temperature.
    The surface now exhibits its inherent semi-translucency and a uniform, micro-textured
    finish.'
