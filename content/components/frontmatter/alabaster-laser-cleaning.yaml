caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a dense, heterogeneous contamination layer approximately
    10-50 micrometers thick. This layer consists of agglomerated carbonaceous particles and inorganic salts, which form a
    discontinuous crust. The underlying alabaster''s natural micro-porosity (approximately 8%) is completely filled, and its
    characteristic crystalline structure is no longer visible.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination forming ridges and nodules that scatter light and create a
    matte, darkened appearance. The original translucency and reflectivity (typically 65% in the visible spectrum) of the
    alabaster are entirely suppressed. The contaminant layer exhibits poor adhesion in some areas, with micro-fractures suggesting
    a brittle, non-cohesive material that has compromised the substrate''s integrity.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the original alabaster
    substrate. The 10-50 micrometer contamination crust has been entirely removed via selective laser ablation, exposing the
    intrinsic micro-crystalline structure. The stone''s natural porosity is now clearly visible and unobstructed, with no
    residual particulate matter lodged within the pores.


    The surface texture is now uniform, with the laser process restoring the material''s inherent smoothness without inducing
    micro-fractures or thermal damage. This has reinstated the stone''s fundamental optical properties; the surface exhibits
    a consistent reflectivity and the characteristic translucency of pure gypsum alabaster. The cleaning has achieved a return
    to the baseline material state.'
