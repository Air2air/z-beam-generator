subtitle: Alabaster is a softer, more porous stone that is sensitive to heat and prone
  to staining. This requires careful laser parameter selection to prevent surface
  damage or discoloration during cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter (e.g., soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of sulfation crusts and organic
    deposits. The underlying stone's micro-crystalline structure is masked, and the
    surface texture appears irregular and occluded. The contaminants exhibit patchy,
    non-uniform adhesion, creating a discontinuous film that alters the stone's intrinsic
    reflectivity and obscures its fine grain.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a significant
    restoration of the original alabaster substrate. The superficial contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intact, micro-crystalline gypsum
    structure. The surface now displays a uniform, finely pitted texture consistent
    with the stone's natural 8.5% porosity, free from embedded particulates. The laser
    process has effectively eliminated the sulfation crusts without inducing micro-fractures
    or thermal alteration, preserving the delicate crystalline boundaries. This results
    in a surface with restored optical properties, where the inherent translucency
    and reflectivity of the alabaster are fully recovered. The cleaning has achieved
    a precise, substrate-selective ablation, halting precisely at the ablation threshold
    of the contaminants.
