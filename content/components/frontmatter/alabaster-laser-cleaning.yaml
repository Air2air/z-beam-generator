caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 micrometers thick. This stratum consists
    of particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological micro-colonies embedded
    within a matrix of aged hydrocarbon binders. The contaminants fill the natural
    micro-porosity (8.5% average) and intergranular boundaries of the gypsum matrix,
    creating a discontinuous, textured crust. This layer exhibits poor adhesion to
    the substrate and significantly alters the stone's intrinsic optical properties,
    scattering light and masking the subsurface translucency.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has selectively removed the contamination crust, fully
    restoring the original gypsum microstructure. The surface now reveals intact crystal
    facets and open porosity, with no measurable damage to the soft (2.0 Mohs) alabaster
    substrate. This exposes the stone's inherent translucency and fine granular texture.

subtitle: Alabaster’s delicate translucency, while beautiful to behold, often poses
  a real hurdle during laser treatment. Adjust your controls to stay below 50 watts,
  ensuring you safeguard that subtle, luminous finish from unintended harm.
