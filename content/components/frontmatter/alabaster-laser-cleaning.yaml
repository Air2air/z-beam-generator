caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter (e.g., soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of sulfation crusts and organic deposits. The underlying stone's micro-crystalline structure is masked, and the surface texture appears irregular and occluded. The contaminants exhibit patchy, non-uniform adhesion, creating a discontinuous film that alters the stone's intrinsic reflectivity and obscures its fine grain.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a significant restoration of the original alabaster substrate. The superficial contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intact, micro-crystalline gypsum structure. The surface now displays a uniform, finely pitted texture consistent with the stone's natural 8.5% porosity, free from embedded particulates. The laser process has effectively eliminated the sulfation crusts without inducing micro-fractures or thermal alteration, preserving the delicate crystalline boundaries. This results in a surface with restored optical properties, where the inherent translucency and reflectivity of the alabaster are fully recovered. The cleaning has achieved a precise, substrate-selective ablation, halting precisely at the ablation threshold of the contaminants.
