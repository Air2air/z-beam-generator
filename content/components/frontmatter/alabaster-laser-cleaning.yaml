caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a dense,
    particulate-laden layer approximately 5-20 µm thick. This crust, composed of carbonaceous
    soot and mineral dust, fills the natural micro-porosity of the stone. The underlying
    crystalline structure is entirely concealed, with contamination adhering to the
    surface topography in an uneven, matte-black coating that disrupts light interaction.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has fully removed the superficial contamination layer,
    revealing the intrinsic microcrystalline structure of the alabaster. The surface
    now exhibits a well-defined, interlocking crystal matrix with a porosity of approximately
    8%. The original surface texture is fully restored, with no evidence of embedded
    particulate matter.


    The primary visual improvement is the re-emergence of the stone''s light-transmitting
    properties. At 500x, the crystalline facets show a reflectivity of 0.12 at 1064
    nm, allowing light to penetrate and scatter from within the material, restoring
    its characteristic translucency. The cleaning process has achieved selective ablation,
    precisely removing contaminants at their 2.5 J/cm² threshold without affecting
    the softer gypsum substrate.


    This results in a surface free of mechanical scratches or chemical residues. The
    precise ablation ensures the preservation of delicate, sub-micron surface features
    and the stone''s natural porosity, confirming the procedure''s non-contact and
    non-abrasive nature. The underlying material integrity, with a compressive strength
    of 60 MPa, remains entirely unaffected.'
