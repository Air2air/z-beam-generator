caption:
  before_text: At 500x magnification, the plywood surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, dust, and organic residues, fills the natural wood pores and micro-fissures.
    The underlying cellular grain structure is largely masked, with contaminants forming
    agglomerates that create a topographically uneven, matte-textured surface.
  after_text: Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals the restored wood substrate.
    The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the clean, open cellular
    structure of the top wood veneer. The surface texture is defined by the natural
    grain and pits, with minimal residual charring. The reflectivity increases measurably
    due to the elimination of light-absorbing contaminants.
