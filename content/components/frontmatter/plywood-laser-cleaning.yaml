        source: 'USDA Forest Service, Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material
          (Chapter 19: Durability and Protection)'
        research_basis: Plywood, typically made from wood veneers, has poor inherent
          corrosion resistance as it is highly susceptible to moisture, fungal decay,
          and insect attack. The "Wood Handbook" states that untreated wood products
          have low durability and require protective treatments for any exterior or
          damp service conditions. While corrosion is a metal-specific term, in the
          context of material degradation, plywood's organic composition makes it
          highly vulnerable to environmental degradation. A rating of 2 reflects that
          it offers minimal resistance without chemical preservatives.

          Products Laboratory (2010)'
        research_basis: Plywood, as an engineered wood product, has thermal degradation
          properties similar to solid wood. The Wood Handbook states that wood in
          air begins significant thermal decomposition around 200°C, with the onset
          of pyrolysis where chemical bonds break and mass loss occurs. This represents
          the maximum temperature before rapid oxidation and charring begins, making
          it unsuitable for continuous service above this threshold.

          Materials, USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, General Technical
          Report FPL-GTR-190'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of plywood varies significantly based
          on species, veneer grade, adhesive type, and construction. The cited USDA
          source provides typical MOR (Modulus of Rupture) values for commercial softwood
          plywood in the range of 20-40 MPa. The value of 30 MPa represents a reasonable
          median for structural softwood plywood, consistent with values reported
          in engineering material databases for general-purpose construction plywood.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of plywood is highly dependent on
          the species of the face veneers, the adhesive type, and the direction of
          loading (parallel or perpendicular to the face grain). The cited source
          provides a typical range of 4.8 to 6.2 MPa for compressive strength perpendicular
          to the face grain for common softwood plywood, with 5.5 MPa being a representative
          median value. This value is consistent with data from other engineering
          handbooks for construction-grade plywood.
