caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the plywood surface is obscured by a continuous,
    amorphous contamination layer approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded soot, dust, and organic residues, fills the natural wood pores and
    creates a textured, matte topography. The underlying wood grain and cellular structure
    are entirely masked, with the contaminant forming a non-uniform, occluding film
    that significantly alters the surface's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively ablates the contamination layer, restoring
    the plywood''s original micro-topography. The wood''s cellular structure, including
    tracheids and vessel elements, is now fully exposed and clearly defined. The surface
    texture reverts to its inherent roughness of approximately 3.5 µm Ra.


    The process selectively removes the contaminant with minimal thermal penetration,
    preserving the integrity of the underlying wood fibers. No charring or heat-affected
    zone is visible, confirming precise energy control below the material''s thermal
    destruction threshold of 300°C. The surface exhibits restored porosity and a clean,
    open-pore structure.'
