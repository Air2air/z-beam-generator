caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the plywood surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a matrix of organic residues, which fills
    the natural porous structure of the wood. The surface texture appears matte and uneven, with the original wood grain and
    cellular structure largely masked. The contaminants create a topographical landscape that increases the measured surface
    roughness, significantly deviating from the substrate's inherent 3.2 µm Ra profile.
  afterText: 'The laser cleaning process has resulted in a complete removal of the superficial contamination layer. The surface
    now reveals the intact, underlying wood fiber structure, with individual tracheids and vessel elements clearly visible.
    The original porous network, characteristic of wood''s approximately 45% porosity, is fully exposed and free of obstructive
    debris.


    Direct comparison shows the elimination of the matte, occluding film. The surface topography now corresponds directly
    to the plywood''s inherent grain pattern, restoring its natural surface roughness profile. There is no evidence of charring
    or thermal degradation, indicating the laser parameters were maintained below the material''s 300°C thermal destruction
    point.


    The cleaning has achieved selective ablation, where the laser energy was preferentially absorbed by the contaminants,
    which typically have a higher absorption coefficient than the wood substrate. This has resulted in a clean, well-defined
    interface at the wood surface without damaging the structural integrity of the cellulose and lignin matrix.'
