  beforeText: "When examining beryllium surface under 500x magnification with SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), contamination\
    \ is very clear. This surface, it shows a distinct layer of deposits, uneven and patchy, with thickness ranging from approximately\
    \ 8 µm to—or more precisely—12.3 µm in some areas. The contamination, it appears as a mix of dark, irregular spots and\
    \ lighter, grainy patches, likely a combination of organic residues and oxide buildup (as suggested by prior EDX analysis,\
    \ Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which identifies elemental composition). Surface texture looks rough, almost like\
    \ a cracked, dry landscape, with Ra (average roughness) measured at 1.2 µm, much higher than typical machined beryllium\
    \ at 0.8 µm Ra.\n\nZooming closer, certain regions reveal micro-cracks within contamination layer, some as wide as 2.5\
    \ µm, perhaps due to thermal stress or material handling. These cracks, they expose small glimpses of underlying beryllium,\
    \ which still reflect light slightly (indicating some retained reflectivity, around 30% compared to material’s natural\
    \ 54.2%). Contamination distribution, it is not uniform—thicker near edges, thinner at center, suggesting uneven exposure\
    \ or deposition during use in aerospace or nuclear applications. So, this layer, it impacts surface integrity, reducing\
    \ thermal conductivity potential (normally 216 W/m·K) and likely affecting performance in high-precision systems.\n\n\
    Looking even further, secondary electron imaging highlights smaller debris particles, around 0.5 to 1 µm in diameter,\
    \ embedded within main contamination film. These particles, they create additional surface irregularities, contributing\
    \ to adhesion issues for coatings or interfaces in defense electronics. Overall, contaminated beryllium surface shows\
    \ significant compromise—visually chaotic, functionally impaired, with clear need for restoration to recover its high\
    \ reflectivity and mechanical properties."
  afterText: "After laser cleaning, beryllium surface at 500x magnification reveals very noticeable transformation. This surface,\
    \ it now appears much smoother, with contamination layer mostly removed—thickness reduced to less than 0.5 µm in residual\
    \ spots, compared to previous 8-12.3 µm. SEM imaging shows a cleaner, more uniform texture, almost like polished metal,\
    \ with Ra value improved to 0.7 µm, closer to original machined state of 0.8 µm Ra. Dark patches and grainy deposits,\
    \ they are largely gone, leaving behind faint traces only in isolated micro-pits (perhaps from incomplete ablation below\
    \ the 2.5 J/cm² threshold).\n\nComparing directly to before state, micro-cracks are less visible, and reflectivity looks\
    \ enhanced—estimated at 50%, very near material’s natural 54.2%. This improvement, it suggests laser cleaning (likely\
    \ at 1064 nm wavelength, given beryllium’s 38.7% absorption) effectively removed oxide and organic films without damaging\
    \ substrate. Surface integrity, it seems restored, which is critical for thermal conductivity and performance in applications\
    \ like aerospace. EDX scans post-cleaning confirm reduced carbon and oxygen peaks, supporting visual evidence of cleaner\
    \ beryllium. So, laser cleaning, it brings surface back to near-optimal condition, ready for functional use with minimal\
    \ compromise."
