caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate, amorphous carbon deposits, and localized oxide patches, creating
    a topographically complex and textured landscape. The underlying metallic grain
    structure is entirely masked. The contaminants exhibit a mottled, splotchy pattern,
    indicating areas of preferential adhesion and oxidation, which disrupts the native
    surface morphology.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation.
    The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the pristine, polycrystalline
    metallic substrate. The characteristic grain structure of the beryllium, with
    its HCP crystalline arrangement, is now clearly visible and well-defined.


    The surface texture is significantly smoother and more uniform, with only minimal,
    sub-micron scale pitting remaining from the removal of tenacious oxide inclusions.
    This process restores the material''s native reflectivity and creates a surface
    free of obscuring films, directly exposing the bare metal for subsequent processing
    or analysis.'
