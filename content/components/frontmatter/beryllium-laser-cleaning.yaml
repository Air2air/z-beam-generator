caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a matte, textured crust of oxides and embedded particulate matter, which
    masks the underlying metallic grain structure. The contaminants form irregular, patchy islands, creating a topographically
    complex and rough surface profile.


    Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) would likely detect elevated levels of oxygen and carbon, confirming the presence
    of beryllium oxide (BeO) and adsorbed hydrocarbons. The original, hard HCP (hexagonal close-packed) crystalline surface
    of the beryllium is entirely hidden. The contamination disrupts the surface''s inherent thermal and reflective properties,
    presenting a barrier to both visual inspection and functional performance.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The contamination crust has been completely
    removed, revealing the pristine, polycrystalline grain structure of the beryllium substrate. The surface is now characterized
    by a uniform, metallic luster and a significantly reduced micro-roughness.


    The laser process has selectively ablated the contaminants without damaging the underlying metal, as evidenced by the
    clear, well-defined grain boundaries now visible. This restoration of the original surface geometry ensures optimal thermal
    conductivity and reflectivity, which are critical for the component''s performance in demanding applications.'
