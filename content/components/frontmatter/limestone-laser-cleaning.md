description: Technical overview of Limestone, primarily composed of CaCO3, used in
  laser cleaning applications. Limestone's natural porosity and susceptibility to
  contamination make it an ideal candidate for laser cleaning. The process utilizes
  the photomechanical effect to remove surface contaminants while preserving the integrity
  of the stone, ensuring minimal damage to the underlying material structure. This
  technique is particularly effective for the restoration of historical and architectural
  limestone elements, where precision and non-invasiveness are critical.
