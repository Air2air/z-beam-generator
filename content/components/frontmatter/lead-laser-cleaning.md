description: Lead laser cleaning utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters optimized for lead's low melting point (327°C) and high absorption at 1064nm. The process effectively removes oxides, radioactive contamination, and surface deposits while minimizing lead vaporization and maintaining dimensional stability.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: 99.7% reduction in lead waste generation
  description: Traditional abrasive methods produce 300-500g of contaminated waste per m² vs 1-2g with laser cleaning
- benefit: Zero chemical solvent usage
  description: Eliminates 100% of solvent consumption compared to chemical cleaning methods requiring 2-5 L/m²
