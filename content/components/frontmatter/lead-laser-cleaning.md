description: Technical overview of Lead, Pb, for laser cleaning. Lead, with the chemical
  symbol Pb, is a heavy metal that can be effectively treated using laser ablation
  techniques. The process involves the precise removal of surface contaminants from
  lead components, ensuring minimal impact on the material's integrity. The use of
  a 1064nm wavelength laser, with fluence ranging from 1.0 to 10 J/cm² and pulse durations
  between 10-200ns, allows for non-contact cleaning, which is particularly beneficial
  for preserving the structural characteristics of lead. This method is extensively
  used in the automotive and electronics industries to restore the surface condition
  of lead parts.
