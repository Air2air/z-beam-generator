        research_basis: Fir is a softwood with low natural durability against decay
          fungi, insects, and moisture. The Wood Handbook rates untreated fir species
          as "slightly to non-resistant" to decay, placing it in the lowest durability
          categories. While it has some resistance when kept dry, its performance
          in general environmental conditions with moisture exposure is poor without
          chemical treatment.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood in air
          is generally limited to 150°C. Above this temperature, significant thermal
          degradation begins, including hemicellulose decomposition and oxidative
          reactions that permanently reduce mechanical properties. While ignition
          temperature for fir is higher (~200-300°C), the 150°C limit represents the
          temperature where chemical changes and oxidation become significant for
          long-term structural integrity.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties.
          For "Douglas-fir" (a primary commercial Fir species), the handbook lists
          a modulus of rupture (MOR), which is flexural strength, of 12,400 psi, which
          converts to approximately 85 MPa. However, this is for clear, straight-grained
          wood at 12% moisture content. A more conservative and commonly referenced
          design value for structural lumber (accounting for defects, knots, and long-term
          loading) is around 65 MPa. The confidence is high as the source is definitive,
          but the specific value depends on the grade and moisture content, hence
          not a perfect 1.00.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties.
          For "Fir," which typically refers to Douglas-Fir or true firs in engineering
          contexts, the compressive strength parallel to the grain is listed as 40
          MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the standard test condition for reporting
          wood strength properties. This value is consistent with the known density
          and hardness provided.
