subtitle: Fir has a relatively soft, resinous surface that can be easily marked. This
  requires careful control of the laser's power to clean effectively without scorching
  the wood.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fir surface is obscured by a complex contamination
    layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of particulate matter,
    soot, and embedded grime that fills the porous wood structure. The underlying
    tracheids and ray cells are no longer visible, masked by a discontinuous, amorphous
    film that alters the surface texture and reflects light unevenly. The contamination
    adheres strongly within the 65% porosity, creating a blotchy, occluded appearance
    that compromises the substrate's integrity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively restored the native fir surface. The contamination
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the clean, open cellular structure of the
    wood. Individual tracheids and ray parenchyma are now clearly defined, with sharp
    edges and a uniform, light-toned appearance. The surface texture is consistent,
    with the material's inherent 65% porosity fully exposed, resulting in a substrate
    that is visually coherent and mechanically sound for further treatment.
