caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fir surface is obscured by a dense, non-uniform
    contamination layer averaging 15-20 µm thick. This matrix of carbonaceous soot,
    embedded particulate matter, and biological residues fills the porous wood structure.
    The underlying tracheids and medullary rays are completely masked, with the contaminant
    forming a cracked, crust-like texture that compromises the original surface integrity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively restored the native fir surface, revealing
    the intricate cellular anatomy previously concealed. The porous tracheid structure
    and medullary rays are now fully exposed, with cell wall boundaries sharply defined.
    The process has selectively removed the contamination layer without measurable
    damage to the underlying wood substrate.


    The surface exhibits a clean, open-pore network with a porosity of approximately
    65%, confirming the removal of occluding materials. The original wood texture
    is preserved, with a minimal surface roughness increase of less than 5 µm attributed
    to the gentle ablation of degraded surface lignin. This precise, non-contact method
    successfully eliminated the contamination while maintaining the structural integrity
    of the fir''s delicate cellular framework.'

subtitle: Pay attention to Fir’s varying grain patterns during laser treatment. Adjusting
  power levels to stay below 50 watts ensures you protect the softwood’s delicate
  face while still removing contaminants effectively.
