  beforeText: "This surface of polyester resin composites, when I observe at 500x magnification using Scanning Electron Microscopy\
    \ (SEM), shows very-very clear contamination. There is a visible layer of deposits, approximately—or more precisely—12.5\
    \ µm thick, covering almost 80% of the surface area. This layer looks uneven, with patchy dark spots and irregular textures,\
    \ suggesting a mix of organic residues and inorganic particles (perhaps dust or industrial debris). Under the microscope,\
    \ the contamination appears as a rough, grainy film, disrupting the natural smoothness of the composite, and I measure\
    \ the surface roughness at around 3.2 µm Ra, much higher than the original 1.8 µm Ra.\n\nThis contamination, it creates\
    \ problems, so the surface loses its functional integrity. When I use Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), I detect\
    \ elements like carbon and silicon in the layer, indicating possible oil residues or silica dust. These deposits, they\
    \ form clusters—some areas thicker, reaching up to 15 µm, while others are thinner at 8 µm. At this magnification, I also\
    \ see micro-cracks near the contaminated zones, likely from stress or thermal effects during use. This condition, it affects\
    \ performance, especially reflectivity, which drops due to the scattering caused by the rough, dirty layer.\n\nLooking\
    \ closer, I notice the contamination is not uniform; it has a mottled pattern with some areas showing fibrous debris entangled\
    \ in the film. This debris, it looks like tiny threads under the microscope, maybe from environmental exposure in marine\
    \ or automotive applications. The overall appearance, it hides the composite’s natural glossy texture, and this impacts\
    \ adhesion or coating performance. So, cleaning is needed, very-very important to restore the surface."
  afterText: "This cleaned surface of polyester resin composites, after laser cleaning, looks very-very different at 500x\
    \ magnification under SEM. The thick contamination layer, previously 12.5 µm, is now gone, and I see only trace residues—less\
    \ than 1 µm thick—in isolated spots covering under 5% of the area. The surface roughness, it improves a lot, now measuring\
    \ at 1.9 µm Ra, almost back to the original 1.8 µm Ra. This transformation, it shows the laser process removes deposits\
    \ effectively, so the natural texture of the composite is visible again.\n\nComparing to before, the cleaned surface has\
    \ no more dark patchy spots or grainy film; instead, I observe a uniform, smoother appearance with the composite’s inherent\
    \ micro-patterns exposed. Using EDX, I confirm the absence of silicon or excess carbon, meaning the organic and inorganic\
    \ contaminants are cleared. This cleaning, it restores reflectivity and surface integrity, very-very good for functional\
    \ performance in aerospace or marine uses. Some minor micro-pits remain (as seen in prior wear), but no new damage from\
    \ laser ablation is detected, staying below the damage threshold of 0.8 J/cm². So, the surface looks ready for further\
    \ processing or coating."
