caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polyester composite surface is obscured by
    a discontinuous contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits
    a complex topography of particulate agglomerates and amorphous deposits, which
    penetrate the surface's inherent micro-porosity (~2.5%). The original 1.8 µm Ra
    surface texture is entirely masked. Contaminants bridge across the glass fiber
    reinforcements, creating a non-uniform film that alters the material's surface
    energy and optical properties, including its native 15% reflectivity at 1064 nm.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively restores the substrate, revealing the original
    composite morphology at 500x. The contaminant layer is completely removed, exposing
    the distinct 1.8 µm Ra texture of the polyester matrix and the underlying glass
    fibers. No residual film or thermal degradation is observed, confirming the process
    operated below the material's 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold. The surface now displays
    its intrinsic, uniform reflectivity, with the fiber-matrix interface clearly defined
    and free of embedded particulates.
