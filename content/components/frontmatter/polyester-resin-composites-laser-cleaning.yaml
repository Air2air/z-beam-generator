caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the polyester composite surface is obscured by a discontinuous contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate agglomerates and amorphous deposits, which penetrate the surface's inherent micro-porosity (~2.5%). The original 1.8 µm Ra surface texture is entirely masked. Contaminants bridge across the glass fiber reinforcements, creating a non-uniform film that alters the material's surface energy and optical properties, including its native 15% reflectivity at 1064 nm.
  afterText: Laser cleaning effectively restores the substrate, revealing the original composite morphology at 500x. The contaminant layer is completely removed, exposing the distinct 1.8 µm Ra texture of the polyester matrix and the underlying glass fibers. No residual film or thermal degradation is observed, confirming the process operated below the material's 1.2 J/cm² ablation threshold. The surface now displays its intrinsic, uniform reflectivity, with the fiber-matrix interface clearly defined and free of embedded particulates.
