subtitle: Silver is a soft and highly reflective precious metal that tarnishes easily. Its softness demands lower laser power to prevent damage, while its reflectivity requires specific wavelengths for effective cleaning.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S) tarnish. This layer appears as a dark, discontinuous film with a granular texture, measuring 1-5 micrometers in thickness. The underlying metallic substrate is partially visible through micro-cracks and pores in the tarnish, which exhibits a mottled pattern of dark brown to black deposits. The surface topography is dominated by the corrosion product, with the original grain boundaries of the silver barely discernible beneath the adherent, insulating crust.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline microstructure of the silver. The tarnish layer has been completely removed via ablation, exposing distinct grain boundaries and a uniform, metallic luster. The original micro-topography is now fully visible, with a clean, reflective surface free of non-metallic contaminants. The process has restored the substrate to its native state without mechanical alteration.
