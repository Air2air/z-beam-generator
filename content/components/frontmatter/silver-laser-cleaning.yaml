caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of agglomerated particles, primarily carbonaceous soot and sulfide-based tarnish
    (silver sulfide). The tarnish manifests as a dark, discontinuous film, while the particulate contamination appears as
    a topographical landscape of fine, irregularly shaped deposits.


    The underlying silver microstructure is not visible. The contamination creates a textured, matte surface that scatters
    light, eliminating the metal''s inherent reflectivity. The particle distribution is not even, with some areas showing
    dense agglomeration and others revealing thinner, more translucent tarnish films that still obscure the substrate.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine silver substrate. The
    surface now exhibits the characteristic grain structure of the polycrystalline metal, with clear, distinct boundaries
    between individual crystal facets. The matte, light-scattering texture has been replaced by a smooth, highly reflective
    surface.


    The transformation is evident in the restoration of metallic reflectivity and the elimination of all particulate and tarnish
    residues. The laser process has achieved this without observable surface damage, such as melting or ablation pits, leaving
    behind a clean, metallurgically intact surface ready for further processing or application.'
