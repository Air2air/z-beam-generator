caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, primarily composed of silver sulfide (Ag₂S) tarnish. This
    layer exhibits a crystalline, dendritic structure with a typical thickness of
    5-15 micrometers. The underlying metal's topography is completely masked by this
    dark, granular film, which adheres in a patchy, discontinuous pattern. Micro-fissures
    and porosity within the tarnish layer are visible, indicating a brittle, heterogeneous
    composition. The original surface texture, including fine machining lines or grain
    boundaries, is entirely undetectable beneath this insulating and optically opaque
    crust.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration
    of the pristine metallic surface. The micron-scale tarnish layer has been entirely
    ablated, exposing the underlying silver's distinct polycrystalline grain structure.
    The surface now displays clear grain boundaries and any original micro-topography,
    such as fine polishing lines, which were previously concealed. The transformation
    is evident in the high reflectivity and sharp definition of surface features,
    with no visible thermal damage or melting to the base metal. The process has successfully
    returned the surface to its original, contamination-free state with sub-micron
    precision.

subtitle: Silver often poses a unique hurdle due to its high reflectivity. Adjust
  your laser controls to below 50 watts initially, or you’ll risk uneven treatment
  across its delicate finish.
