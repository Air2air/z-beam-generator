caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    tarnish layer, primarily silver sulfide (Ag₂S). This layer measures 1-5 micrometers
    thick and exhibits a granular, crystalline morphology. The underlying metal's
    topography is masked by this dark, adherent scale, which creates a matte, low-reflectivity
    surface. Micro-cracking and localized pitting are visible within the contamination,
    indicating progressive corrosive degradation.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the original metallic surface by selectively
    ablating the contaminant layer. At 500x, the transformation is evident: the matte,
    granular tarnish is completely removed, revealing the substrate''s inherent grain
    structure and polishing lines. The surface now displays high reflectivity, with
    laser scan tracks visible as subtle, parallel striations measuring under 2 micrometers
    in depth.


    This process exploits silver''s high thermal conductivity (429 W/m·K) to rapidly
    dissipate heat, confining the laser''s energy to the surface contaminants. The
    result is a microscopically clean interface free of chemical residues, with the
    base metal''s FCC crystalline structure intact. No thermal distortion or melting
    of the silver substrate is observed, preserving its mechanical integrity.'
