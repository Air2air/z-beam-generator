  "beforeText": "At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of agglomerated particles, primarily carbonaceous soot and sulfide-based tarnish (silver sulfide). The tarnish manifests as a dark, discontinuous film, while the particulate contamination appears as a topographical landscape of fine, irregularly shaped deposits.\n\nThe underlying silver microstructure is not visible. The contamination creates a textured, matte surface that scatters light, eliminating the metal's inherent reflectivity. The particle distribution is not even, with some areas showing dense agglomeration and others revealing thinner, more translucent tarnish films that still obscure the substrate."
  "afterText": "Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing the pristine silver substrate. The surface now exhibits the characteristic grain structure of the polycrystalline metal, with clear, distinct boundaries between individual crystal facets. The matte, light-scattering texture has been replaced by a smooth, highly reflective surface.\n\nThe transformation is evident in the restoration of metallic reflectivity and the elimination of all particulate and tarnish residues. The laser process has achieved this without observable surface damage, such as melting or ablation pits, leaving behind a clean, metallurgically intact surface ready for further processing or application."
