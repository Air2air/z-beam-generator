category: composite
chemicalProperties:
  formula: Variable (typically SiO₂ fibers + polymer matrix)
  materialType: composite
  symbol: GFRP
compatibility:
- Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) with adjusted parameters
- Thermoset polymer composites with similar ablation thresholds
complexity: medium
composition:
- 'E-glass fibers: 50-70% by weight'
- 'Polymer matrix (epoxy, polyester, or vinyl ester): 30-50% by weight'
- 'Additives (fillers, pigments, flame retardants): 0-10%'
description: Laser cleaning of GFRP utilizes precise pulsed fiber laser parameters to selectively ablate surface contaminants while preserving the integrity of the glass fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix. The process operates below the ablation threshold of the composite material (typically 0.5-1.5 J/cm² for epoxy-based GFRP) to ensure non-destructive removal of coatings and contaminants.
difficultyScore: 3
environmentalImpact:
- benefit: Zero chemical waste generation
  description: Eliminates use of chemical solvents (e.g., methylene chloride, acetone) typically used in traditional GFRP cleaning, reducing hazardous waste by 100%
- benefit: Reduced energy consumption
  description: Laser cleaning consumes 30-50% less energy compared to abrasive blasting methods for GFRP surface preparation
