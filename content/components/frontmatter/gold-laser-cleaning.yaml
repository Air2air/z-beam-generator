caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the gold surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 0.5 to 5 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of particulate matter, organic residues, and adsorbed atmospheric compounds.
    The contaminants form irregular patches and dendritic patterns, disrupting the
    substrate's inherent metallic luster and creating a topographically complex, matte
    surface. The underlying gold microstructure is entirely concealed by this adherent
    film.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a surface where the original, pristine gold substrate
    is fully revealed. At 500x magnification, the contamination layer is completely
    absent, exposing the characteristic grain structure of the FCC crystalline metal.
    The surface now exhibits high reflectivity, with laser scan lines visible as subtle,
    uniform striations. Minor, pre-existing micro-abrasions on the gold itself may
    be visible, but no thermal damage, melting, or pitting is present. The result
    is a topographically uniform surface with restored specular reflection, confirming
    the selective removal of contaminants without affecting the bulk material integrity.
