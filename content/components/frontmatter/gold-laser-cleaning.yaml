caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the gold surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer approximately 5-10
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and particulate matter, which appear as dark,
    blotchy regions that scatter light and mask the underlying metal''s reflectivity.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contaminants filling the natural grain boundaries of the gold''s polycrystalline
    structure. The deposits form a non-uniform, matte film that significantly reduces the intrinsic luster of the substrate.
    Isolated particles, likely embedded silica or other hard contaminants, are visible as raised features on the surface.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation at 500x magnification is pronounced. The matte, discontinuous
    contamination layer has been entirely removed, revealing the continuous, reflective gold substrate beneath. The process
    has restored the metal''s inherent high reflectivity, which now appears as a bright, specular surface.


    The underlying polycrystalline structure of the gold is now fully visible, with clean, well-defined grain boundaries.
    The surface is free of the previously observed carbonaceous films and embedded particulates. The cleaning has achieved
    this result without inducing surface melting or ablation of the gold substrate, as confirmed by the preservation of the
    original grain morphology.


    This precision is attributable to the laser parameters being tuned below gold''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm². The
    mechanism relied on the rapid thermal expansion of the contaminants, which have a much lower thermal conductivity than
    the gold, causing them to detache cleanly. The result is a surface with no measurable topographical damage to the precious
    metal.'
