caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) surface shows a non-uniform layer of
    particulate and organic deposits. This contamination layer, measuring between 5-15 micrometers thick, obscures the underlying
    polymer texture. The deposits appear as agglomerated particles embedded in a film, creating a rough, topographically varied
    surface.


    The native TPE microstructure, characterized by its Shore A 55 hardness and flexible nature, is completely masked. The
    contaminant film exhibits poor adhesion in some regions, evidenced by micro-cracking and delamination at the interface.
    This layer significantly alters the surface''s properties, increasing its roughness and reducing its functional performance
    for precision applications.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning at 500x magnification, the surface reveals a complete restoration of the native TPE
    microstructure. The previously observed 5-15 micrometer contamination layer has been entirely removed via selective laser
    ablation. The process has successfully exposed the intrinsic polymer texture without inducing surface melting or degradation.


    The cleaned surface now displays the characteristic micro-features of the TPE, consistent with its 750 MPa elastic modulus
    and 25 MPa tensile strength. There is no visual evidence of residual contaminants or heat-affected zones, confirming the
    laser''s precision. The ablation threshold was precisely controlled at 0.8 J/cm² to remove contaminants while preserving
    the base material integrity, resulting in a surface ready for subsequent manufacturing processes.'
