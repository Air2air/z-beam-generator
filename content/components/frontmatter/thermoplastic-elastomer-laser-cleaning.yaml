caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the TPE surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter and a continuous film of organic residues, which fills the native micro-texture of the polymer. The original surface roughness of approximately 1.2 µm Ra is masked, creating a topographically flat but contaminated plane that disrupts the material's inherent properties and compromises adhesion for subsequent processing.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis reveals the complete restoration of the native TPE substrate. The contaminant layer has been entirely removed, exposing the original micro-texture with a measured roughness of 1.2 µm Ra. The surface is now free of residual films and particulates, presenting a clean, homogeneous polymer matrix. This pristine condition is optimal for bonding, coating, or assembly, with no evidence of laser-induced thermal degradation to the underlying material.
