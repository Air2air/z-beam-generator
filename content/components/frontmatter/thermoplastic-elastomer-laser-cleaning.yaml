caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the TPE surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter and a continuous film of organic residues, which fills the
    native micro-texture of the polymer. The original surface roughness of approximately
    1.2 µm Ra is masked, creating a topographically flat but contaminated plane that
    disrupts the material's inherent properties and compromises adhesion for subsequent
    processing.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis reveals the complete restoration of the native
    TPE substrate. The contaminant layer has been entirely removed, exposing the original
    micro-texture with a measured roughness of 1.2 µm Ra. The surface is now free
    of residual films and particulates, presenting a clean, homogeneous polymer matrix.
    This pristine condition is optimal for bonding, coating, or assembly, with no
    evidence of laser-induced thermal degradation to the underlying material.
