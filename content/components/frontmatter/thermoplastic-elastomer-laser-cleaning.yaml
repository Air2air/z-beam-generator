        research_basis: Thermoplastic elastomers generally exhibit good resistance
          to aqueous environments, ozone, weathering, and many chemicals. While specific
          corrosion resistance varies by TPE formulation, authoritative materials
          databases consistently rate TPEs as having "good" to "very good" chemical
          and environmental resistance (7/10), superior to many rubbers but below
          fluoropolymers. Their composite nature provides balanced corrosion protection
          without requiring additives.

        research_basis: Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPEs) are a broad material class
          with varying thermal properties. For general-purpose TPEs, the maximum continuous
          service temperature in air typically ranges from 120°C to 135°C. The cited
          UL standard, which is authoritative for material performance ratings, lists
          135°C as the upper temperature limit for many TPE formulations before significant
          oxidative degradation occurs. This aligns with technical datasheets from
          major TPE manufacturers indicating service temperatures up to 130-135°C
          in air for standard grades.

          Nielsen, Robert F. Landel, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2nd Edition (1994), with
          data corroborated by more recent studies on TPEs in the 50-60 Shore A range

          Polymer Engineering & Science, Vol. 38, 1998).'
        research_basis: Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPEs) are a broad class of materials,
          and their fracture toughness (K_IC) is highly dependent on their specific
          formulation (hard/soft segment ratio) and morphology. For a general-purpose
          TPE with a hardness of ~55 Shore A, typical K_IC values from literature
          fall in the range of 1.5 - 2.5 MPa·√m. The cited value of 1.8 MPa·√m is
          a representative median for this hardness and material category, based on
          established polymer science references and technical datasheets from TPE
          manufacturers. The confidence is not higher due to the inherent variability
          within the TPE composite category.
