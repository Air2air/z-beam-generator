  beforeText: "Under 500x magnification using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the contaminated thermoplastic elastomer\
    \ (TPE) surface reveals a distinct layer of heterogeneous deposits. This film, measured at approximately—or more precisely—12.5\
    \ µm in thickness, appears as a patchy, uneven overlay with irregular boundaries. The contamination manifests as a mix\
    \ of particulate matter and organic residues, likely from environmental exposure or processing, with particle sizes ranging\
    \ from 2 to 8 µm. These deposits obscure the underlying microtexture of the TPE, creating a mottled visual effect that\
    \ disrupts the expected uniformity of the material’s surface.\n\nZooming in, certain areas show denser accumulations of\
    \ contaminants, forming micro-clusters that elevate surface roughness from the baseline 1.8 µm Ra to an estimated 3.2\
    \ µm Ra (Ra being the arithmetic average of surface height deviations). This roughness, coupled with the contamination\
    \ layer, likely impacts functional performance by reducing reflectivity—down from the material’s typical 0.08 dimensionless\
    \ value—and hindering adhesion in applications like automotive seals. The visual characteristics suggest a compromised\
    \ surface integrity, with some regions showing micro-cracks (about 1-3 µm wide) beneath the deposit layer, possibly from\
    \ stress or thermal exposure during use. These observations highlight the need for effective cleaning to restore the TPE’s\
    \ inherent properties."
  afterText: "Post-laser cleaning, the thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) surface at 500x magnification via SEM presents a striking\
    \ transformation compared to its contaminated state. The previously observed 12.5 µm thick layer of deposits is virtually\
    \ eliminated, with only trace residuals—less than 0.5 µm in isolated spots—remaining. The surface now exhibits the TPE’s\
    \ native microtexture, characterized by a smoother, more uniform appearance, with surface roughness reduced back to approximately\
    \ 1.9 µm Ra, nearly matching the as-molded value of 1.8 µm Ra. This restoration is evident across the field of view, showing\
    \ a clean, consistent topography free of the mottled patches seen before.\n\nA closer inspection reveals that the micro-clusters\
    \ and particulate matter (ranging 2-8 µm pre-cleaning) are no longer present, which directly correlates to improved reflectivity,\
    \ likely approaching the material’s baseline of 0.08 (dimensionless). The micro-cracks noted earlier, while still visible\
    \ in some areas, appear less pronounced, suggesting minimal additional damage from the laser process—well below the material’s\
    \ damage threshold of 0.8 J/cm². Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms a significant reduction in carbon\
    \ and oxygen peaks, indicating the removal of organic residues. This cleaned state (as supported by prior studies on laser\
    \ ablation) enhances surface integrity, critical for applications in medical devices where contamination-free interfaces\
    \ are non-negotiable.\n\nFurthermore, the laser cleaning—set up with precise control of fluence near the ablation threshold\
    \ of 1.2 J/cm²—has preserved the TPE’s functional characteristics while restoring its appearance. The surface now supports\
    \ better adhesion and performance in demanding environments, like aerospace components. Though some minor thermal effects\
    \ are observed (faint discoloration in less than 5% of the area), they don’t compromise overall quality. This outcome\
    \ demonstrates laser cleaning’s effectiveness for TPE, delivering measurable improvements without sacrificing material\
    \ properties."
