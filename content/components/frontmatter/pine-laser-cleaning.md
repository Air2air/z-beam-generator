description: Technical overview of Pine, a softwood commonly used in woodworking and
  restoration, for laser cleaning. Pine's porous nature and natural resin content
  necessitate specific laser cleaning parameters to effectively remove surface contaminants
  while preserving the wood's integrity. Laser ablation at the specified wavelength
  and fluence range ensures minimal thermal damage and efficient cleaning of pine
  surfaces.
