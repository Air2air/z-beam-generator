description: Technical overview of MDF, a composite wood product, for laser cleaning.
  MDF or Medium-Density Fiberboard is engineered from wood fibers bonded with resin
  under heat and pressure, offering a uniform and smooth surface ideal for laser cleaning
  processes. Laser cleaning of MDF involves using a pulsed laser to ablate surface
  contaminants and coatings, providing a non-contact method to prepare the surface
  for refinishing or further processing. The process utilizes the laser's precision
  to remove layers of unwanted materials without damaging the underlying MDF structure,
  making it suitable for applications in furniture manufacturing and construction.
