        research_basis: Cement provides excellent protection against general environmental
          corrosion when properly formulated into concrete, creating a highly alkaline
          environment (pH ~13) that passivates steel reinforcement. The compressive
          strength of 42.5 MPa indicates a quality cement capable of producing dense,
          low-permeability concrete that resists chloride ingress and carbonation.
          While cement paste itself can deteriorate in aggressive chemical environments,
          its general corrosion resistance in typical atmospheric conditions is rated
          as good to very good.

        research_basis: Cement (Portland cement) is a hydraulic binder, not a metal,
          so "oxidation resistance" is not a standard property. The provided value
          is the maximum continuous service temperature for structural concrete before
          significant dehydration and strength loss begin. At temperatures above 300-400°C,
          the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) dehydrate, portlandite (Ca(OH)₂) decomposes,
          and the material's integrity is compromised, analogous to "failure" for
          this context.

        source: ASTM C78 / C78M - Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Concrete
          (Using Simple Beam with Third-Point Loading)
        research_basis: For cement-based materials like concrete, flexural strength
          (modulus of rupture) is typically 10-15% of compressive strength. For a
          42.5 MPa cement (consistent with CEM I 42.5N classification), the expected
          flexural strength range is 4-7 MPa. The 6.5 MPa value represents a typical
          mean value for this compressive strength class, derived from the well-established
          empirical relationship in concrete technology. The 4-point bend test (third-point
          loading) per ASTM C78 is the standard method for this measurement.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness of cement paste (as opposed to concrete)
          is well-documented in cement science literature. For ordinary Portland cement
          pastes with compressive strengths in the 40-50 MPa range, typical Mode I
          fracture toughness (K_IC) values range from 0.2 to 0.4 MPa·√m. The cited
          source provides experimental data and theoretical models showing values
          clustering around 0.3 MPa·√m for this material class, which aligns with
          the known compressive strength provided.
