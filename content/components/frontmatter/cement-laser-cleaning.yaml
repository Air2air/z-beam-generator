caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cement surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of embedded particulate matter, soot, and biological growth, filling the natural 28% porosity of the cement matrix. The surface texture is irregular and matte, with a high degree of laser light scattering due to the uneven, low-reflectivity contaminants. The original cementitious microstructure is entirely masked, compromising its functional and aesthetic properties.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic cementitious microstructure. The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing the original porosity and aggregate boundaries. The surface texture is uniform, with a measurable increase in reflectivity to approximately 15%, restoring the substrate's inherent profile without thermal damage to the underlying matrix.
