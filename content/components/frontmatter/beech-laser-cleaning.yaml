caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the beech surface is obscured by a discontinuous contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter embedded in a matrix of aged, cross-linked organic residues,
    which fills the natural wood pores and creates a textured, uneven topography. The underlying cellular structure of the
    beech is partially visible but its definition is lost, with the grain pattern muted by the film.


    The contaminants exhibit poor adhesion in some areas, showing micro-cracking and delamination from the wood substrate.
    This suggests a brittle, aged coating that does not flex with the wood''s natural dimensional changes. The original porous
    structure of the wood, typically 55% porosity, is largely occluded, preventing any analysis of the true substrate beneath.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination layer, revealing the intact, original beech wood substrate.
    The surface now displays a clear, open cellular structure, with the distinctive vessels and fibers of the hardwood fully
    exposed. The natural porosity of the wood is restored, allowing for direct observation of the clean, undamaged cell walls.


    In direct contrast to the pre-cleaning state, the surface topography is now defined solely by the wood''s inherent anatomy
    rather than an applied film. The laser parameters were tuned to operate just above the ablation threshold of the contaminants
    (approximately 0.8 J/cm²) but well below the thermal destruction point of the beech lignin (380°C). This selective removal
    is confirmed by the absence of charring or discoloration.


    Analysis confirms the preservation of the primary cell wall structure. There is no evidence of melting, splintering, or
    significant material loss from the wood itself, indicating a controlled ablation process that leveraged the differential
    absorption of laser energy between the contaminant and the substrate. The surface is clean and chemically unaltered, suitable
    for subsequent conservation treatments.'
