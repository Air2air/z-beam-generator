caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the beech surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates, oxidized oils, and microbial biofilm, fills the wood's porous structure.
    The underlying cellular anatomy, including vessels and rays, is largely concealed,
    with only the tops of the tallest fiber cells visible through the discontinuous
    film.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has completely removed the contamination layer, revealing
    the intact, original cellular structure of the beech wood. The surface now exhibits
    a clear, open porosity of approximately 55%, with individual vessels, fibers,
    and medullary rays distinctly visible. The laser process has selectively ablated
    the contaminants, which had a lower ablation threshold than the beech substrate,
    without depositing secondary residues.


    The cleaned surface texture is defined by the natural, undulating topography of
    the cell walls. There is no evidence of the charring or thermal degradation that
    would occur at the wood''s thermal destruction point of 380°C, confirming a controlled
    ablation process. The reflectivity has increased from the previously muted, matte
    finish to a value consistent with clean wood (approximately 15% at 1064 nm), enhancing
    the material''s inherent visual characteristics. This precise, non-contact cleaning
    restores the surface to a state suitable for high-tolerance applications in medical
    and aerospace components.'

subtitle: Beech hardwood often presents a subtle challenge due to its varying grain
  density. Operators have learned that adjusting laser power below 50 watts, while
  closely monitoring the finish, helps preserve its natural, elegant texture.
