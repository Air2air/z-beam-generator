subtitle: Beech has a fine, uniform grain but its density can vary significantly.
  This requires careful calibration of laser settings to avoid uneven cleaning or
  surface discoloration.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the beech surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer averaging 15-45 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of embedded
    soot, dust, and degraded organic residues, fills the natural wood porosity (55%)
    and masks the underlying cellular structure. The surface texture is highly irregular,
    with particulate agglomerates creating a topographically complex and optically
    dense film that scatters light and alters the material's intrinsic reflectivity
    of 15%.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the clean, open lumens of the beech's cellular
    structure with no measurable substrate damage. The surface topography is now defined
    by the wood's natural grain and porosity, resulting in a uniform surface with
    restored optical properties.
