description: Technical overview of Cedar, a softwood known for its natural resistance
  to decay and insect damage, for laser cleaning. Cedar's unique cellular structure
  and natural oils make it an ideal candidate for non-contact laser cleaning processes,
  allowing for the precise removal of surface contaminants and old finishes without
  compromising the integrity of the wood. This method is particularly beneficial in
  the restoration of historical Cedar structures and in woodworking applications where
  the preservation of the material's aesthetic and structural qualities is paramount.
