description: Technical overview of Rubber, a versatile material used in various industries,
  for laser cleaning. Rubber exhibits excellent elasticity and durability, making
  it ideal for applications such as gaskets and seals. Laser cleaning of rubber involves
  the removal of surface contaminants and residues through precise laser ablation,
  ensuring minimal impact on the material’s integrity and properties. This process
  enhances the surface quality and adhesion properties, critical for subsequent processing
  steps like bonding or coating.
