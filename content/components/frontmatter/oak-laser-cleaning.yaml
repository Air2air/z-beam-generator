subtitle: Oak has a prominent grain structure and high tannin content, unlike many
  other hardwoods. These traits require careful laser power adjustment to clean effectively
  without leaving shadows or causing discoloration.

caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the oak surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of soot,
    grime, and degraded organic matter, fills the wood's porous structure, masking
    the characteristic cellular anatomy. The surface texture is homogenized, presenting
    a cracked, crust-like morphology that completely conceals the underlying wood
    grain and vessel elements.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the intact oak substrate. The surface now displays a clear, open cellular structure
    with distinct longitudinal tracheids and large vessel elements characteristic
    of oak. The original wood grain pattern is fully exposed, with a return to a textured,
    micro-rough surface topography that corresponds to the natural hardness variations
    between earlywood and latewood.


    The removal process is highly selective, ablating the contaminant crust at approximately
    400°C while the underlying wood, with a pyrolysis point of 280°C, remains structurally
    sound. This is evidenced by the sharp, well-defined edges of the cell walls and
    the absence of charring or thermal degradation halos. The cleaning parameters
    are calibrated to the oak''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm², ensuring precise
    energy delivery.


    The resulting surface exhibits a porosity of 55%, restoring the material''s inherent
    hygroscopic properties. The contrast between the dense, lignin-rich cell walls
    and the open lumens is now visually distinct, confirming the restoration of the
    wood''s original microstructural integrity without mechanical abrasion or chemical
    residue.'
