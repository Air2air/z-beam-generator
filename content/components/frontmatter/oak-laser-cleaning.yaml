caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the oak surface is obscured by a dense, amorphous
    contamination layer, approximately 20-50 micrometers thick. This layer, composed
    of soot, dust, and biological films, fills the wood's cellular lumen and macro-pores.
    The underlying grain texture is largely undetectable, with only the most prominent
    growth rings visible as faint undulations beneath the uniform, matte-black coating.
  afterText: 'Laser ablation has removed the opaque contamination layer, fully restoring
    the oak''s microscopic topography. The cellular structure, including lumen, rays,
    and macro-pores, is now clearly defined and free of obstructive debris. The original
    wood surface is exposed, revealing the distinct, undulating pattern of growth
    rings and the sharp boundaries between earlywood and latewood.


    The cleaning process has selectively vaporized the contaminant layer with minimal
    thermal alteration to the underlying wood substrate. The surface exhibits a clean,
    sharp interface between the remaining wood cells and the now-open pores. This
    precision results in a surface where the intrinsic, complex texture of the oak
    is the dominant visual feature, with no residual film to obscure its structural
    details.'
