        research_basis: Oak is a durable hardwood with good resistance to decay and
          environmental corrosion when not in ground contact. Its natural tannins
          and dense cell structure provide protection against fungal decay and weathering,
          though it is not as resistant as some tropical hardwoods or treated woods.
          The rating reflects its performance in above-ground, non-marine environments.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is a primary authoritative source for wood properties. It states that prolonged
          exposure to temperatures above 150 °C (300 °F) leads to significant chemical
          degradation, including pyrolysis and oxidation, which reduces strength and
          mass. This temperature is widely cited as the maximum for continuous service
          before significant thermal decomposition begins.

        research_basis: The USDA Forest Products Laboratory is the preeminent authority
          on North American wood properties. The Wood Handbook provides a flexural
          strength (modulus of rupture) value of 97 MPa for White Oak, a primary species
          of Oak used in engineering applications, based on standardized 3-point and
          4-point bend tests on small, clear specimens. This value is widely cited
          and accepted in engineering and design standards.

          Oak"
        research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
          data for various oak species. The reported compressive strength (crushing
          strength) parallel to grain for white oak is approximately 46 MPa, while
          red oak is around 43 MPa. This value represents the stress at the proportional
          limit during standard testing per ASTM D143. Test conditions assume 12%
          moisture content and loading parallel to grain, which is the standard reporting
          method for wood compressive strength.
