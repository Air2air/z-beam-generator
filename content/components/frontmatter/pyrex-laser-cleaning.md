description: Technical overview of Pyrex, a borosilicate glass known for its exceptional
  thermal resistance and chemical durability, which makes it ideal for laser cleaning
  applications. Pyrex's low thermal expansion coefficient minimizes the risk of cracking
  or distortion during the laser ablation process, ensuring consistent and high-quality
  cleaning results across various industrial applications.
