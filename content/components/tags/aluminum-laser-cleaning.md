### Aluminum Laser Cleaning Applications

Aluminum and its alloys respond exceptionally well to laser cleaning processes due to their favorable optical and thermal properties. The technology provides precise control over surface preparation for various industrial applications.

#### Material Characteristics
- High reflectivity: 85-95% at near-IR wavelengths
- Thermal conductivity: 200-250 W/m·K
- Melting point: 660°C
- Oxide layer thickness: 2-5 nanometers

#### Process Parameters
- Optimal wavelength: 1064nm (fundamental Nd:YAG)
- Pulse energy: 0.5-2.0 mJ
- Spot size: 50-200 μm
- Scanning speed: 100-500 mm/s

#### Surface Quality Considerations
The laser cleaning process can achieve surface roughness values comparable to chemical etching while maintaining the dimensional accuracy of the original component.
