# Laser Cleaning of Concrete

## Material Properties and Laser Interaction

Concrete (CO) is a composite masonry material with a density of 2400 kg/m³. Its low thermal conductivity (1.4 W/m·K) and high melting point (1200°C) are critical for laser cleaning. This is important because the laser's energy efficiently ablates surface contaminants like dirt, biological growth, or paint without damaging the substrate. In practice, we can see that the laser selectively removes the coating, which has a lower ablation threshold than the concrete itself.

## Optimal Parameters and Applications

Analysis shows that systematic parameter analysis is vital. **Nd:YAG or fiber lasers with short pulses (nanosecond range)** are optimal. Key settings include:
1.  Low to medium fluence (J/cm²) to avoid etching
2.  High repetition rate for uniform cleaning
3.  Appropriate spot size for coverage efficiency

This is highly effective for **equipment cleaning** and **environmental remediation** in mining, marine applications, and humid tropical environments, removing salts and corrosive agents without chemicals or waste.

## Advantages and Results

Laser cleaning offers a dry, non-abrasive alternative to sandblasting or chemical methods, which is crucial for community-based implementations and protecting structural integrity. The result should be a clean, sound concrete surface with its original profile intact, free of contaminants and without micro-cracking. This supports affordability and collective benefits in renewable energy and remediation processes.
