# Stoneware Overview
Stoneware, a type of non-porous ceramic made from clay and other materials, offers unique properties for laser cleaning.

## Sparkle and Shine
One sentence section.

### The Dance of Light and Texture
When it comes to laser cleaning stoneware, you're in for a treat. Imagine walking along the historic tiles of a Spanish courtyard, where stoneware's durability meets beauty. As the laser dances across its surface, you might hear a gentle crackling, almost like the sound of a distant bonfire, as contaminants evaporate. The material, which initially may look dull or stained, starts to gleam right before your eyes—it's like watching the sunrise over a foggy morning, revealing the beauty beneath. In terms of technical specs, we're usually working with a 1064 nm wavelength in the infrared spectrum, which stoneware absorbs well, ensuring effective cleaning without damage. Safety-wise, remember to wear those funky goggles—Class 4 laser systems are no joke! You'll find stoneware in kitchens, outdoor patios, and even art installations because of its resilience and aesthetic appeal. The challenge? Sometimes deeper stains require multiple passes, but adjusting the fluence levels between 1-5 J/cm² can help. And the results? A uniform shine that feels smooth to the touch, reflecting the care put into cleaning it.

#### Quick Tips
Adjust fluence for deeper cleaning.
Always wear protective eyewear.

## Sensory Symphony
The laser's hum blends with the crackling of evaporating grime, creating a symphony of cleaning.

### Why Laser Cleaning Rocks for Stoneware
Laser cleaning stoneware is like giving it a spa day—it comes out refreshed and revitalized. Unlike sandblasting, which can be messy and abrasive, or chemicals that might leave residues, laser cleaning is eco-friendly and precise. Plus, it's cool to the touch, making it safer for delicate pieces. You won't find this level of care with other methods, which is why laser cleaning is the go-to for preserving the integrity and beauty of stoneware.

## A Gleaming Success
A successful clean is evident when the stoneware reflects light evenly, showcasing its true colors and smooth texture.
