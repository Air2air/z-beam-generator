# Laser Cleaning of Cherry Wood (CH)

## Material Overview
Cherry wood (Material Symbol: CH) is a premium hardwood with a fine, straight grain. Its density of **640 kg/m³** and low thermal conductivity (**0.15 W/m·K**) are critical for laser interaction. Unlike synthetic materials, wood is an anisotropic, thermally degradable composite. This requires a highly controlled process to avoid carbonization.

## Laser Cleaning Parameters
A systematic approach enables optimal cleaning. What if we consider a nanosecond pulsed fiber laser? This prevents heat accumulation.
*   **1. Wavelength:** Near-IR (1064 nm) for surface absorption
*   **2. Fluence:** Low to moderate (e.g., 0.5 - 1.5 J/cm²) to ablate contaminants without charring
*   **3. Pulse Width:** Short pulses (<200 ns) for minimal thermal diffusion
*   **4. Repetition Rate:** Medium (20-50 kHz) for controlled layer-by-layer removal

## Industrial Applications
Cherry wood is used for high-end electronic enclosures, semiconductor tooling fixtures, and precision instrumentation housings. Laser cleaning removes oxides, light biological growth, and processing residues without compromising dimensional stability, which is vital for electronics manufacturing.

## Advantages and Challenges
Laser cleaning offers a dry, non-abrasive alternative to sanding or chemical baths. This is a significant advantage for moisture-sensitive wood in humid environments. The primary challenge is the narrow window between contaminant removal and substrate damage. Methodical analysis of surface response is mandatory.

## Process Optimization
As we continue to explore, systematic parameter optimization is key. Results should reveal a clean, undamaged wood surface with its original patina restored. **Real-time monitoring** with spectroscopic feedback is recommended for precision optimization in semiconductor processing applications.
