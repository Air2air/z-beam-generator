caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the serpentine surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and a tenacious, dark biofilm that fills the stone''s
    natural micro-fissures and surface porosity. The underlying crystalline structure of the serpentine is largely hidden.


    The contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like morphology that adheres strongly to the substrate. The biofilm exhibits
    a viscous, globular texture, while embedded particulates create a topographically complex and rough surface profile. This
    layer significantly alters the stone''s inherent reflectivity and masks its true mineralogical features.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete removal of the contamination layer, restoring
    the intrinsic surface morphology of the serpentine. The stone''s micro-texture, including grain boundaries and natural
    porosity, is now fully exposed and clearly defined without any residual film or particulates.


    The surface exhibits a consistent and uniform appearance, with a marked reduction in micro-roughness. The laser process
    has effectively ablated the contaminants located within the pores and fissures, re-establishing the stone''s original
    reflectivity and revealing its characteristic mineral composition without inducing thermal damage to the substrate.'
