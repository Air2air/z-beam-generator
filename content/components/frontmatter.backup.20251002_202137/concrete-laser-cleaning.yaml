caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the concrete surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, such as carbon soot and mineral salts, fused within the cementitious
    matrix. The natural porosity is occluded, and the surface texture is homogenized,
    masking the underlying aggregate and cement paste. A network of micro-fissures
    is often visible within the contaminant crust, indicating its brittle nature and
    poor adhesion to the substrate.
  afterText: 'Post-cleaning, the microscopic view reveals the restored concrete substrate.
    The superficial contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic
    surface morphology. The original porosity, with pore sizes ranging from 10-100
    µm, is now fully open and unobstructed.


    The distinct phases of the material—the hard aggregate particles and the softer
    cement paste—are clearly delineated, restoring the surface''s natural micro-roughness.
    This process effectively eliminates the contaminant matrix without inducing thermal
    damage, preserving the structural integrity of the concrete at the micron scale.
    The surface is now optimally prepared for subsequent treatments or coatings.'
