caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silver surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of micro-crystalline
    silver sulfide (Ag₂S) tarnish and particulate matter, creating a matte, topographically
    complex surface. The underlying metallic luster is entirely absent, with the contaminant
    forming a continuous, light-absorbing film that masks the original grain structure
    and micro-texture of the base metal.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the pristine
    silver substrate. The surface now exhibits a clear, reflective grain structure
    with defined boundaries. Microscopic scratches from the original manufacturing
    process may be visible, but the uniform, light-absorbing tarnish film is entirely
    absent, restoring full specular reflectivity.
