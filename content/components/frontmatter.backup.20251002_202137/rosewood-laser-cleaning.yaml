caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rosewood surface is obscured by a dense,
    stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed
    of embedded soot, oxidized finish, and particulate matter, fills the wood's porous
    structure and masks the natural grain. The surface texture is irregular and matte,
    with contaminants forming a discontinuous crust that compromises the substrate's
    integrity and visual definition.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals the complete removal of the contamination
    crust, exposing the pristine wood substrate. The intricate cellular structure,
    including vessels and medullary rays, is now fully visible with sharp definition.
    The surface topography is restored to its native state, exhibiting a clean, open
    porosity and the characteristic grain pattern of rosewood, free from any residual
    deposits or laser-induced scorching. The primary visual improvement is the restoration
    of micro-scale surface detail.
