caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the brass surface is obscured by a complex, stratified
    contamination layer. A base layer of copper oxide (Cu₂O), approximately 2-5 µm
    thick, appears as a tenacious, crystalline matrix bonded to the underlying metal.
    Overlying this, a porous and irregular crust of basic copper carbonates and sulfates
    (e.g., Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂ and Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆) forms a topographical landscape with a roughness
    (Ra) exceeding 5 µm. This stratified structure, with a total thickness often reaching
    10-15 µm, completely masks the original metallic grain structure and surface finish
    of the brass substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has completely removed the stratified contamination, revealing
    the pristine, underlying brass substrate. The surface now displays the original
    grain boundaries and machining marks with a roughness (Ra) of approximately 0.8
    µm. The uniform, metallic surface exhibits minimal heat-affected zone, confirming
    the precise, ablative nature of the process.
