caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the urethane composite surface is obscured by
    a non-uniform contamination layer, typically measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This
    layer consists of embedded particulate matter, such as silica dust and carbonaceous
    soot, within a matrix of adhered organic residues. The underlying composite's
    molded texture, with a baseline roughness of approximately 1.2 µm Ra, is partially
    masked. The contaminants form a discontinuous, agglomerated film that fills the
    microscopic valleys of the substrate, creating a topographically muted and irregular
    surface profile that compromises adhesion and interferes with dimensional inspection.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the
    restored urethane composite substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via ablation, exposing the original molded texture with a measured roughness
    of 1.1-1.3 µm Ra. The surface is free of residual film, and the filler particles
    within the composite are now clearly visible and undamaged. This results in a
    clean, well-defined topography with no evidence of melting or thermal degradation,
    confirming the selective and non-abrasive nature of the laser process.
