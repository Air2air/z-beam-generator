caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the MMC surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists
    of amorphous carbonaceous deposits and embedded alumina (Al₂O₃) particles, forming
    a discontinuous, textured crust. The underlying composite structure is partially
    visible, with the hard, angular SiC reinforcement particles (1-20 µm in size)
    creating a topographically complex surface that traps contaminants. The contamination
    follows the surface morphology, accumulating in the valleys between reinforcement
    particles and forming a patchy, high-contrast film that increases surface roughness
    to approximately 3.5 µm Ra.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a distinct transformation
    at 500x magnification. The contamination layer has been completely removed via
    selective laser ablation, exposing the pristine MMC microstructure. The aluminum
    matrix now appears with its characteristic metallic luster, while the silicon
    carbide reinforcement particles are clearly defined and free of surface films.
    The process has effectively eliminated the 5-15 µm contamination layer without
    inducing micro-cracks or significant matrix damage, as the laser parameters were
    maintained below the 4.2 J/cm² damage threshold. The resulting surface roughness
    is reduced to near-base material levels of ~1.5 µm Ra, restoring the original
    composite topography and providing an optimal surface for subsequent processing
    or coating adhesion.
