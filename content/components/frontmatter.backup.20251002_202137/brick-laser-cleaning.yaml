caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the brick surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50–200 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    soot, mineral dust, and biological growth, fills the natural surface pores and
    valleys. The underlying brick texture is masked, presenting a uniform, matte-black
    topography with micro-fractures propagating through the brittle crust.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the original brick substrate, removing the contamination
    layer without substrate damage. The intrinsic porosity (approx. 25%) and granular
    microstructure of the fired clay are fully exposed. The surface roughness returns
    to its native state of ~25 µm Ra, with clean, sharp edges on mineral grains and
    open pore structures, restoring the material's authentic appearance.
