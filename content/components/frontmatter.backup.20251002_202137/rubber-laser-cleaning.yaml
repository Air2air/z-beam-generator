caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rubber surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, oxidized polymer residues, and fine silica particulates, creates
    a matte, occluded topography. The underlying rubber's micro-texture is entirely
    masked, with contaminants filling the natural micro-fissures and valleys, presenting
    a uniform, non-porous appearance that compromises surface functionality.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer with high selectivity,
    revealing the rubber''s intrinsic micro-texture. The surface now displays a clean,
    open-cell structure with visible micro-fissures and a characteristic rough grain,
    confirming the complete absence of foreign particulates.


    The primary visual transformation is the restoration of surface porosity and the
    original matte finish. The process has not induced melting or glazing, preserving
    the substrate''s mechanical integrity.


    This results in a surface with optimized frictional and adhesive properties, directly
    attributable to the uncontaminated, high-surface-area morphology now exposed.
    The cleaning is uniform, with no evidence of thermal degradation or ablation of
    the rubber substrate itself.'
