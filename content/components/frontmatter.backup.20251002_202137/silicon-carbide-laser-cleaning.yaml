caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon carbide surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically
    5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, such as alumina or silica dust, embedded in a matrix of hydrocarbon
    residues. The underlying SiC microstructure, including its characteristic grain boundaries, is entirely masked. The surface
    texture appears matte and irregular, with contamination accumulating preferentially in microscopic surface valleys, creating
    a topographically complex and optically obstructive film.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic polycrystalline structure of the sintered silicon
    carbide. Individual grains and their boundaries are now clearly defined and free of foreign material. The surface texture
    is restored to its original state, exhibiting minimal topographical variation from the ablation process.


    The cleaning process has selectively removed the contamination layer without exceeding the material''s ablation threshold
    of 2.8 J/cm², preserving the substrate''s integrity. The surface reflectivity has increased measurably, returning to its
    nominal value of approximately 0.21 at 1064 nm. This results in a visually uniform and pristine surface, with no evidence
    of thermal stress cracking or melting, confirming the non-contact precision of the method.'
