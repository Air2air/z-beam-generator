caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the birch surface is obscured by a heterogeneous
    contamination layer averaging 15-25 µm in thickness. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, embedded within a matrix of aged, cross-linked organic residues. The contaminants
    fill the wood's porous structure, masking the characteristic cellular anatomy.
    The original grain texture is undetectable, replaced by a cracked, amorphous crust
    that exhibits poor adhesion to the underlying substrate. This layer significantly
    alters the surface's optical and topographical properties, creating a uniform,
    matte appearance that lacks wood's natural definition.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination layer, fully
    restoring the birch's microscopic anatomy. At 500x magnification, the surface
    reveals a clean, open cellular structure with distinct tracheids and vessel elements.
    The original grain pattern is now clearly defined, with a topographical relief
    of 5-10 µm between earlywood and latewood zones. Minor, superficial carbonization
    is visible along some cell walls, a result of localized thermal exposure that
    remains below the threshold for structural damage. The surface is free of residual
    film, presenting its inherent porosity and texture.
