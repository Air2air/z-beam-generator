caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ash surface is characterized by a non-uniform, porous crust of particulate matter.
    This layer, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, exhibits a complex topography of agglomerated particles and interstitial
    voids. The surface texture is rough and irregular, with contamination deeply embedded within the porous structure. Discoloration
    and particulate occlusion obscure the underlying substrate's natural features, creating a visually heterogeneous and obscured
    surface profile.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals a significant transformation. The thick, occluding crust
    of particulate matter has been entirely removed, exposing the pristine, underlying substrate. The surface now displays
    its intrinsic porous architecture, with clearly defined cell structures and grain patterns. The process has achieved a
    high degree of selectivity, ablating the contaminant layer without inducing thermal damage to the substrate, as confirmed
    by the absence of charring or melting. The result is a clean, well-defined surface with restored visual clarity and material
    integrity.
