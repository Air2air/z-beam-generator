caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the bronze surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of a tenacious
    copper oxide (cuprite) and tin oxide (cassiterite) matrix, intermixed with embedded
    particulate matter and chloride salts. The underlying metal's grain structure
    is entirely concealed. The surface texture is highly irregular, with localized
    pitting and a porous, crust-like morphology that promotes further corrosive activity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the stratified contamination layer,
    revealing the original, intact bronze substrate. The surface now exhibits a uniform
    micro-topography with a consistent grain structure and a measured roughness of
    approximately 0.8 µm Ra. The process has eliminated the porous crust and particulate
    matter, restoring the metal's inherent metallic luster and a clean, well-defined
    surface profile.
