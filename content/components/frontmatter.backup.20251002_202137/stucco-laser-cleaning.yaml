caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stucco surface is obscured by a dense, stratified
    contamination layer approximately 50-200 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous
    soot, gypsum-rich atmospheric particulates, and biological growth, fills the natural
    surface pores and valleys. The underlying cementitious matrix is largely hidden,
    with only the highest aggregate peaks visible. The texture is homogenized, presenting
    a matte, occluded profile that significantly reduces light reflectivity from the
    native substrate.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the intrinsic micro-topography of the stucco.
    The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing the full complexity of
    the cement binder and sand aggregate at the surface. The original porosity (approx.
    25%) and a surface roughness of ~45 µm Ra are now fully exposed. This results
    in a clear, well-defined interface between material phases and a measurable increase
    in surface reflectivity to its inherent 0.22 value.
