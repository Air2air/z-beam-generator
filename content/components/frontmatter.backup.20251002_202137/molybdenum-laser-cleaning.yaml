caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the molybdenum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer,
    ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness, consists of particulate matter and a tenacious oxide scale. The underlying
    BCC grain structure of the molybdenum is entirely concealed. The topography is highly irregular, with contamination filling
    the native micro-texture of the metal, creating a matte, non-reflective appearance. The layer exhibits micro-cracking
    and localized pitting, indicative of chemical attack and compromised surface integrity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline structure of the molybdenum. The
    contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the distinct grain boundaries and a uniform, micro-rough texture
    characteristic of the base metal. The surface reflectivity is significantly increased, and the original metallic luster
    is restored. No evidence of thermal stress cracking or melting is observed, confirming a controlled, non-abrasive cleaning
    process.
