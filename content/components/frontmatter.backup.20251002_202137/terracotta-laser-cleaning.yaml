caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the terracotta surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A stratified crust, measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres
    to the original substrate. This layer consists of particulate matter (e.g., soot,
    dust) embedded within a gypsum or calcium sulfate matrix, a common product of
    atmospheric pollution reacting with the ceramic. The underlying terracotta's characteristic
    porous microstructure is completely occluded, with contaminants filling the 15%
    open porosity. The surface texture is irregular and confluent, masking the intrinsic
    granularity of the fired clay body.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the microscopic view reveals the original terracotta substrate.
    The contamination crust has been entirely removed, exposing the intrinsic 15%
    porosity and the granular structure of the sintered clay particles. The surface
    texture is now defined by the material's natural micro-topography, with a clear
    boundary between the ceramic matrix and its pores. The risk of sub-surface microfracturing
    is minimized, as the laser parameters were maintained below the 1.8 J/cm² damage
    threshold.
