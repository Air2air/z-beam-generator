caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the indium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of carbonaceous
    deposits, embedded particles, and a discontinuous oxide film (In₂O₃). The underlying
    metal's soft, ductile texture is masked, presenting a mottled, topographically
    complex surface that compromises its functional properties and solderability.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the intrinsic, high-purity indium surface. At
    500x, the metal exhibits its characteristic ductile grain structure with minimal
    topographical alteration. The surface is free of oxides and particulate contaminants,
    restoring its uniform metallic luster and reflectivity. This pristine state ensures
    optimal electrical contact and bonding interfaces.
