caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhodium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate matter, micro-crystalline deposits, and localized corrosion
    products. The underlying metallic substrate is partially visible, with its characteristic FCC grain structure masked by
    the adherent, discontinuous film that scatters light and reduces reflectivity.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline structure of the rhodium substrate.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed via ablation, exposing well-defined grain boundaries and a uniform,
    micro-textured finish. The high reflectivity (78% at 1064 nm) of the pure metal is restored.


    The process leverages the material''s high thermal conductivity (150 W/m·K) to rapidly dissipate heat, preventing thermal
    damage to the bulk material. This results in a surface free of melting or micro-cracking, preserving the metal''s intrinsic
    hardness of 110 HV and excellent oxidation resistance. The cleaning is selective, operating above the 2.8 J/cm² ablation
    threshold of contaminants while remaining below the damage threshold of the rhodium itself.'
