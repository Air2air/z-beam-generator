caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the niobium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer consists of adherent oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and embedded particulate matter, creating a textured,
    matte topography. The underlying metallic grain structure is entirely masked. The contamination exhibits a cracked, mudflat-like
    pattern, with localized pitting indicating areas of incipient corrosion beneath the deposits.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native niobium surface, revealing the fine, polygonal grain structure of the
    BCC metal. The contamination layer is completely absent, leaving a uniform, reflective surface with minimal topographical
    alteration. The process has eliminated the cracked oxide pattern and exposed pits, resulting in a clean, metallurgically
    pure interface.
