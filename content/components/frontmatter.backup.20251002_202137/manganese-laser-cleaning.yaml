caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the manganese surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of a porous
    matrix of oxide scale (primarily MnO and Mn3O4) and embedded particulate. The
    texture is highly irregular, featuring micro-fissures and delamination sites where
    the brittle oxide has cracked due to thermal stress. The underlying α-Mn crystalline
    structure is entirely hidden. Contaminants are distributed in dendritic and island-like
    patterns, creating a topographically complex and compromised surface that adversely
    affects functional properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, underlying α-Mn crystalline grain
    structure. The surface now exhibits a uniform, matte-grey metallic appearance
    with a micro-roughened texture resulting from the selective ablation of contaminants.
    At 500x, the grain boundaries are clearly defined, and the surface is free of
    the previous oxide scale and fissures. This process reduces average surface roughness
    (Sa) to the micrometer scale, characteristic of the base metal. The removal of
    the insulating contamination layer restores the material's intrinsic surface properties,
    including its thermal and electrical conductivity, providing an optimal substrate
    for subsequent processes.
