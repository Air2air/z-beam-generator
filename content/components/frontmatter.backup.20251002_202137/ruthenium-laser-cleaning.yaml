caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the ruthenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate matter, crystalline deposits, and amorphous oxides,
    which mask the substrate's inherent metallic luster. The contaminants form dendritic and island-like patterns, creating
    a textured, matte surface that significantly increases light scattering and reduces reflectivity.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, polycrystalline structure of the ruthenium substrate.
    The previously thick contamination layer has been completely removed via ablation, exposing the characteristic grain boundaries
    and cleavage planes of the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metal. The surface now displays a uniform, metallic sheen with
    a mirror-like reflectivity.


    The cleaning process has restored the original micro-topography without inducing thermal damage, such as melting or micro-cracking.
    The result is a clean, well-defined interface with minimal surface roughness, confirming the selective and non-contact
    nature of the laser ablation process. The underlying material integrity is fully preserved.'
