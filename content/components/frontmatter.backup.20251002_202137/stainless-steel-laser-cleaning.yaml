caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-50 µm thick.
    This layer consists of embedded particulates, amorphous oxide scales, and organic residues that mask the underlying metallic
    grain structure. The topography is highly irregular, with contamination filling the natural micro-valleys of the substrate,
    creating a textured, matte appearance that compromises the material's inherent corrosion resistance and surface energy.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its native state, revealing the distinct, uninterrupted grain boundaries
    of the austenitic microstructure. The surface is now characterized by a uniform micro-roughness of approximately 0.8 µm
    Ra, with all foreign layers completely removed. This exposes the pure, passive chromium oxide layer, reinstating optimal
    surface properties for corrosion resistance and adhesion.
