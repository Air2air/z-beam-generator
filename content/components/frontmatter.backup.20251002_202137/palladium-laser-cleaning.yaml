caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the palladium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically measuring
    5-20 µm in thickness. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate matter, crystalline salts, and amorphous
    carbonaceous deposits, which mask the underlying metal's grain structure. The contaminants form a discontinuous, crust-like
    morphology with visible micro-cracking, indicating poor adhesion and differential stress with the palladium substrate.
    The native metallic luster is entirely absent, replaced by a textured, matte surface that compromises the material's functional
    properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the pristine metallic surface. The contamination layer is entirely absent,
    revealing a clean, well-defined grain structure with characteristic FCC metallic luster. The surface is now smooth and
    continuous, with sub-micron laser ablation marks confirming the selective removal process and the absence of substrate
    damage.
