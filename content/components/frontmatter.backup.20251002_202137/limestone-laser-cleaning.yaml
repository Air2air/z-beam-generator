caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the limestone surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer, typically 50-200
    micrometers thick. This layer consists of particulate matter (carbon soot, silica dust) embedded within a matrix of gypsum
    and calcium nitrate, formed from atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen oxides reacting with the calcite substrate. The surface
    texture is highly irregular, with contaminants filling the natural micro-porosity (approx. 5%) and forming a discontinuous
    crust that masks the underlying crystalline structure of the stone. This crust exhibits micro-fracturing and creates a
    weak boundary layer susceptible to spalling.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis reveals the restoration of the original limestone substrate. The superficial contamination
    layer has been entirely removed, exposing the interlocking calcite crystal fabric and reopening the natural pore network.
    The surface texture is now defined by the stone's intrinsic micro-topography, with sharp crystal boundaries and minimal
    residual debris. The process has successfully eliminated the weak boundary layer, leaving a coherent, stable surface with
    no observable thermal damage or alteration to the primary mineral structure.
