caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the maple surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter, embedded within a matrix of oxidized oils and grime, which fills the natural
    wood pores and micro-fissures. The underlying cellular structure, including rays
    and vessels, is largely concealed. The contamination exhibits poor adhesion to
    the substrate, forming a discontinuous film that disrupts the wood's inherent
    surface topography and texture, measured at an elevated 8.5 µm Ra.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the contamination layer, revealing the
    intact, original maple substrate. The surface now displays a clear, open-pore
    structure with well-defined cell walls and vessels. The inherent wood grain pattern
    is fully restored, and the surface roughness is reduced to the native 3.2 µm Ra.
    The process has achieved selective ablation without carbonization or heat-affected
    zones, preserving the wood's structural integrity.
