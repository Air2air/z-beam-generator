caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the rhenium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately 5-15
    µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter and amorphous oxide scales, likely Re₂O₇, which form due to the metal's
    poor oxidation resistance. The underlying HCP crystalline structure is entirely masked, with contamination filling the
    native micro-textural valleys and peaks, creating a topographically flat but chemically compromised surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the native rhenium surface, revealing its intrinsic micro-topography. The volatile
    oxide scales and particulate contamination have been completely removed via ablation, with no measurable substrate damage.
    The original grain structure and machining marks are now distinctly visible, confirming the removal was confined to the
    contamination layer, preserving the base metal's integrity.
