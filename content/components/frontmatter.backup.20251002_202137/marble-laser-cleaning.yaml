caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated marble surface reveals a complex, discontinuous layer of encrusted
    particulates and biological growth. This contamination layer, ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers in thickness, obscures
    the underlying calcite crystal structure. The surface exhibits a high degree of micro-roughness, with particulate matter
    embedded within the stone''s natural micro-porosity (approximately 0.5%).


    The contamination consists of multiple components: a carbon-based soot layer firmly adhered to the surface, gypsum crusts
    (CaSO₄·2H₂O) from atmospheric sulfur compounds, and dendritic patterns of fungal hyphae. These elements create a textured,
    matte topography that significantly increases light scattering. The original polished surface is no longer discernible,
    as the contaminants fill and bridge the microscopic inter-crystalline boundaries.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the marble''s intrinsic microstructure.
    The contamination layer has been entirely removed, exposing the well-defined, interlocking calcite crystals that form
    the stone''s substrate. The surface topography is now defined by the natural crystal geometry, with a significant reduction
    in micro-roughness.


    The laser process has effectively cleared the stone''s micro-porosity, eliminating the embedded particulates and biological
    matter. This results in a surface with markedly higher light reflectivity, as incident light now interacts directly with
    the calcite crystals rather than being scattered by a superficial contamination layer. The original polished finish of
    the stone is now microscopically visible.'
