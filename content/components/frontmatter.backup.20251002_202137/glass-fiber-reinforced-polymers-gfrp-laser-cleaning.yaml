caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the GFRP surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and hydrocarbon deposits, masks the underlying composite texture.
    The topography is irregular, with agglomerated contaminants filling the micro-valleys
    of the 1.8 µm Ra surface. The glass fibers are largely invisible, and the polymer
    matrix appears degraded where contaminants have chemically bonded, compromising
    the substrate's integrity before cleaning.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine GFRP substrate, restoring the original
    surface morphology. The glass fibers are now fully exposed and clearly distinguishable
    from the polymer matrix at 500x magnification. The surface texture has returned
    to its intrinsic 1.8 µm Ra roughness, free of embedded particulates. The cleaning
    process has selectively ablated the contamination layer without inducing fiber
    damage or matrix cracking, confirming the substrate's structural integrity is
    preserved.
