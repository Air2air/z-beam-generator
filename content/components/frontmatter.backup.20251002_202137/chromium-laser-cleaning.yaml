caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the chromium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 20 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of embedded particulate matter, amorphous carbonaceous deposits, and
    localized oxide scales. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden, with
    only occasional glimpses of the original grain structure visible beneath the discontinuous,
    textured film. The contamination adheres in a patchy, irregular pattern, creating
    significant topographical variation and surface roughness that compromises the
    material's intrinsic reflectivity and surface integrity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the substrate, revealing a continuous,
    pristine chromium surface. The contamination layer is entirely absent, exposing
    the material's fine, polycrystalline grain structure with sharp, well-defined
    boundaries. The surface is now uniformly smooth with a mirror-like reflectivity,
    free from the particulate embedment and oxide patches previously observed. This
    restoration confirms the complete removal of subsurface contaminants without damage
    to the base metal.
