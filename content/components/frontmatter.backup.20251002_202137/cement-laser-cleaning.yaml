caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cement surface is obscured by a stratified
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter, carbonaceous soot, and biological growth, which fill the natural
    capillary pores. The original surface texture is masked, creating a uniform, matte,
    and often discolored topography that compromises the substrate's integrity and
    appearance.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contamination layer, revealing
    the intrinsic microstructure of the cement paste. The surface now displays a clear,
    open pore network with visible sand and aggregate particles. The original, complex
    texture is restored, characterized by crystalline hydration products and unreacted
    cement grains.


    The process selectively ablates contaminants with minimal thermal penetration,
    preserving the substrate''s mechanical integrity. The resulting surface exhibits
    a higher degree of light reflectivity and a uniform, clean appearance, confirming
    the successful removal of the obscuring layers without damage to the underlying
    cement matrix.'
