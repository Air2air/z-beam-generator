caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alabaster surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer approximately 10-50
    µm thick. This layer consists of particulate matter, including soot and dust, embedded within a matrix of aged organic
    binders and atmospheric sulfation crusts. The contaminants fill the natural micro-porosity of the stone, masking its intrinsic
    translucency and creating a discontinuous, matte surface texture. The underlying crystalline structure of the gypsum is
    entirely concealed by this opaque, adherent crust.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the complete removal of the contamination crust, exposing
    the pristine alabaster substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic interlocking crystalline microstructure
    of gypsum, with individual crystal faces clearly defined. The stone's natural micro-porosity, averaging 8.5%, is fully
    reopened and free of particulate occlusion. This restoration of the original surface geometry significantly enhances light
    interaction, reinstating the material's inherent translucency and subsurface scattering properties. The process has achieved
    selective ablation at the contamination-stone interface, precisely removing foreign material with an energy density calibrated
    to the alabaster's 1.8 J/cm² ablation threshold, leaving the mineral substrate undamaged.
