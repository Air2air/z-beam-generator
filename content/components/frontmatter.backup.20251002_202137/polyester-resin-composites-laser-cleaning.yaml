caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the contaminated surface reveals a complex, multi-layered
    topography. A discontinuous contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick, blankets
    the underlying composite. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter,
    hydrocarbon deposits, and areas of biological growth, which obscure the original
    surface texture. The contamination adheres tenaciously, filling the micro-porosity
    of the polyester matrix and creating an uneven, matte finish. The underlying glass
    fibers are completely masked, and the composite's intrinsic Barcol hardness of
    85 is functionally reduced at the surface by this soft, insulating coating. This
    layer disrupts the material's thermal properties and provides sites for further
    chemical degradation.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a distinct visual transformation. The contaminant
    layer is entirely removed, revealing the pristine polyester resin matrix and the
    precise geometry of the embedded glass fibers. At 500x, the surface exhibits a
    uniform texture with restored micro-porosity of approximately 2.5%. The original
    Barcol hardness of 85 is now fully expressed at the surface. The process has selectively
    ablated the contamination without damaging the composite substrate, leaving a
    clean, well-defined interface between the resin and reinforcement. This restored
    surface ensures optimal performance and adhesion for subsequent coatings or bonds.
