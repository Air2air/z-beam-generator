caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated Fir surface shows a dense, non-uniform layer of particulate matter
    and amorphous deposits, approximately 15-25 µm thick. This layer obscures the underlying wood anatomy, filling the porous
    tracheid cell structures, which have an average diameter of 30-40 µm. The contamination exhibits a cracked, crust-like
    morphology, with agglomerated particles up to 10 µm in size firmly adhered to the surface.


    The wood''s natural grain texture is largely undetectable beneath this discontinuous crust. The deposits create a topographically
    complex surface that increases the effective surface roughness, masking the original cellular detail. The interface between
    the contamination and the wood substrate appears irregular, with no clear delamination, indicating strong adhesion.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete restoration of the original wood microstructure.
    The porous tracheid cell network is now fully exposed and clearly defined, with cell lumens measuring 30-40 µm in diameter
    appearing clean and unobstructed. The previous 15-25 µm thick contamination layer has been entirely removed, leaving no
    residual particulate matter.


    The surface now exhibits the intrinsic texture of the Fir, with a measured surface roughness of approximately 25 µm corresponding
    to the natural grain pattern. A direct comparison shows the transition from a topographically complex, obscured surface
    to one where the clean, open cell structure is fully visible. The laser process has successfully ablated the contamination
    without inducing observable thermal degradation to the cell walls.'
