caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the copper surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. This layer, ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers in thickness,
    consists of a complex matrix of copper oxides (Cu₂O and CuO), sulfides, and adsorbed
    atmospheric carbon. The topography is highly irregular, featuring powdery, dendritic
    oxide growths and localized pitting. The underlying metallic substrate is largely
    invisible, its high reflectivity attenuated by this porous, light-absorbing crust.
    The contamination follows grain boundaries, creating a network of darker, recessed
    lines across the surface.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface at 500x magnification reveals the
    pristine, polycrystalline copper substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via ablation, exposing the characteristic twinning lines and grain boundaries
    of the face-centered cubic metal. The surface texture is now defined by the material's
    native metallurgy rather than foreign deposits. The high reflectivity of pure
    copper is restored, resulting in a bright, specular surface with minimal micro-scale
    pitting or thermal distortion from the process.
