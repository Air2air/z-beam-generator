caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the shale surface is obscured by a continuous, non-uniform contamination layer averaging
    15-20 micrometers thick. This layer exhibits a complex, amorphous structure that fills the natural micro-fissures and
    pores of the stone. Particulate matter, ranging from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, is embedded within a matrix of carbonaceous
    deposits and mineral accretions, creating a textured, topographically complex surface that masks the underlying shale''s
    granular bedding planes and inherent surface roughness.


    The contamination layer significantly alters the surface''s optical properties, creating a mottled appearance with areas
    of high and low reflectivity. The original shale substrate is only partially visible in isolated areas where the layer
    is thinnest, revealing glimpses of the mineral grains beneath. The overall effect is a loss of surface definition and
    a homogenization of the natural stone texture.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has effectively removed the contamination layer, fully restoring the original shale substrate.
    The surface now displays a clear, well-defined granular texture where individual mineral grains and the distinct layering
    of the bedding planes are fully exposed. The micro-fissure network, previously filled with deposits, is now open and visible,
    demonstrating the precision of the contaminant removal without damage to the underlying stone structure.


    The removal of the light-absorbing contamination has restored the surface''s inherent reflectivity. The contrast between
    different mineral components within the shale is now pronounced, and the natural surface roughness of approximately 12.5
    micrometers Ra is fully apparent. There is no visual evidence of residual carbonaceous film or particulate matter within
    the observable field.


    Comparative analysis confirms the process selectively ablated the contamination layer, which had a lower ablation threshold
    than the shale itself. The result is a microscopically clean surface where the intrinsic geological features of the shale
    are fully revealed without thermal alteration, such as melting or cracking, to the primary mineral matrix.'
