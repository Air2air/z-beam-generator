caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the cobalt surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous deposits, and particulate matter, creating a topographically
    complex and textured surface. The underlying metallic substrate is largely hidden,
    with the contamination forming irregular, matte-black patches that disrupt the
    material's native reflectivity and surface integrity.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a complete
    restoration of the native cobalt substrate. The previous 5-15 µm contamination
    layer has been entirely removed via selective laser ablation. The surface now
    exhibits a uniform, micro-roughened texture characteristic of the underlying metal''s
    HCP crystalline structure, with no evidence of embedded foreign material.


    The reflectivity has increased significantly, with the surface now displaying
    a consistent metallic luster. The cleaning process has exposed the material''s
    grain boundaries and inherent micro-topography without inducing surface melting
    or heat-affected zones that could compromise the mechanical properties.


    This results in a surface with restored chemical and physical integrity, free
    from the discontinuities that previously served as initiation points for corrosion
    or fatigue. The process achieves a cleanliness level suitable for subsequent high-integrity
    applications, such as medical device implantation or aerospace component bonding.'
