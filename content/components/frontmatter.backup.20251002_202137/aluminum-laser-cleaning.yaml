caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the aluminum surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and embedded particulate matter, creating a rough, textured
    topography. The surface exhibits a matte, dark appearance due to light scattering
    from these micro-scale irregularities and pores, which trap contaminants and significantly
    reduce the native metal's reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning removes the contamination layer, revealing the underlying
    substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic fine grain structure of
    the FCC aluminum matrix. The reflectivity is restored to over 90%, and the topography
    is significantly smoother, with micro-imperfections reduced to the sub-micron
    level. This exposes a pristine, metallically bright surface ideal for subsequent
    processing or bonding.
