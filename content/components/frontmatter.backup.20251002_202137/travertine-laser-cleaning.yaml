caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the travertine surface is obscured by a continuous, amorphous contamination layer approximately
    10-50 µm thick. This layer, composed of carbonaceous particulates, gypsum crusts, and biological growth, fills the natural
    pores and voids characteristic of the stone's 12.5% porosity. The underlying crystalline calcite structure and surface
    texture are entirely masked, with the contaminant exhibiting a cracked, crust-like morphology.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully removed the superficial contamination layer, revealing the pristine calcite matrix.
    The stone's intrinsic porosity and microcrystalline texture are now clearly defined, with pore diameters ranging from
    5-200 µm. The surface exhibits no thermal damage, as the process remained well below calcium carbonate's 825°C decomposition
    threshold. The ablation has restored the original surface topography without mechanical alteration to the substrate.
