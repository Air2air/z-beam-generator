caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the plaster surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer, typically 50-200 µm thick. This stratum consists of particulate
    matter (e.g., soot, dust) embedded within a matrix of organic residues and salts,
    which fills the material's inherent microporosity (approx. 35%). The contaminants
    form a discontinuous, crust-like film that masks the underlying crystalline structure
    of the calcium sulfate dihydrate. This layer significantly alters the surface's
    optical properties, increasing light absorption and reducing the intrinsic reflectivity
    of the plaster substrate. The texture is highly irregular, with fissures and protrusions
    creating a topographically complex and unstable surface.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has selectively removed the contamination layer, fully
    restoring the original plaster substrate. The microcrystalline structure of the
    calcium sulfate dihydrate is now fully exposed and intact, with a porosity of
    35% clearly visible. The surface topography is uniform, and the material's intrinsic
    reflectivity has been reinstated without thermal alteration to the underlying
    plaster.
