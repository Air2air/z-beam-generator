caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the zirconia surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of agglomerated
    particulate matter, including sub-micron metal oxides and polymer residues, embedded
    within a carbonaceous film. The underlying ceramic's fine-grained microstructure
    is entirely masked. The contaminants form a discontinuous, splotchy pattern that
    adheres to surface asperities, creating a topographically complex and optically
    matte finish that significantly increases light scattering.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals the intrinsic, fine-grained
    polycrystalline structure of the zirconia. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed via ablation, restoring a uniform, reflective surface. The original machining
    marks and grain boundaries are now clearly visible, with no evidence of thermal
    microcracking or substrate damage.
