caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Inconel surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of adherent
    oxide scales, often displaying a granular, sintered texture, and embedded carbonaceous
    deposits. The underlying alloy's microstructure is entirely concealed. The contamination
    follows a patchy, irregular pattern, with areas of thick, crust-like buildup adjacent
    to thinner, discolored films, indicating non-uniform degradation.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, metallurgically intact Inconel
    substrate. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing the original
    grain boundaries and the fine, dendritic structure of the alloy. The surface exhibits
    a uniform, matte metallic finish with a light micro-texture from the laser interaction.


    This process effectively removes the insulating oxide and carbon layers without
    inducing micro-cracks or significant melting, preserving the base metal''s integrity.
    The restored surface is characterized by its cleanliness and the distinct contrast
    of the gamma prime precipitates within the face-centered cubic matrix.


    The transformation results in a surface with optimal characteristics for subsequent
    processes, such as re-coating, welding, or inspection, free from the thermal barriers
    and potential initiation sites presented by the prior contamination.'
