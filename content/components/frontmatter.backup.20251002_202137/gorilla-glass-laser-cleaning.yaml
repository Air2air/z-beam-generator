caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Gorilla Glass surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A discontinuous film of organic residues and particulate
    matter, approximately 0.5–2.0 µm thick, adheres to the native surface. This layer
    exhibits a mottled, non-uniform texture, with agglomerated particles creating
    localized topographical peaks. The underlying glass, with its characteristic 0.5
    nm Ra smoothness from the manufacturing process, is largely hidden. The contaminants
    disrupt the surface's homogeneity, scattering light and creating a hazy, diffuse
    appearance under the microscope, which directly compromises optical clarity and
    interfacial properties.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a surface restored
    to its intrinsic state. The contamination layer has been completely ablated, exposing
    the pristine glass substrate with a measured surface roughness of 0.5 nm Ra. The
    visual transformation is marked by the elimination of light-scattering particulates
    and films, resulting in a homogenous, featureless plane under optical inspection.
    The surface now exhibits its engineered compressive stress layer of approximately
    800 MPa, fully intact and unobstructed. This restoration ensures optimal optical
    transmissivity of 91.5% in the visible spectrum and provides a perfectly clean
    interface for subsequent bonding or coating processes, with no measurable damage
    to the glass network.
