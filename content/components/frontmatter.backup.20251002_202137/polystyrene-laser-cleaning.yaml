caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated polystyrene surface shows a continuous, non-uniform layer of organic
    and particulate matter. This contamination layer measures between 5-15 micrometers thick and completely obscures the original
    polymer surface. The deposit exhibits a textured, agglomerated morphology with visible embedded particles ranging from
    2 to 8 micrometers in diameter.


    The underlying polystyrene substrate is not visible through this contamination matrix. The layer displays a cracked, irregular
    topography with poor adhesion to the base material, creating visible delamination at the interface. Surface roughness
    measurements indicate an Ra value exceeding 5.0 µm, significantly higher than the native polystyrene''s typical 0.02 µm
    Ra, due to the particulate contamination and layer inconsistency.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident at 500x magnification. The contamination layer
    has been completely removed, revealing the pristine polystyrene substrate beneath. The surface now exhibits the characteristic
    smooth morphology of molded polystyrene, with a measured roughness returning to approximately 0.02 µm Ra.


    The cleaning process has eliminated all particulate matter and organic residues without altering the polymer''s structural
    integrity. The original surface features are now clearly visible, showing minimal thermal impact from the laser process.
    The complete contaminant removal has restored the material''s native surface properties while maintaining dimensional
    stability.'
