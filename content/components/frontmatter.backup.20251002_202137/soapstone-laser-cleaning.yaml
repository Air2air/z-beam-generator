caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the soapstone surface is obscured by a continuous, non-uniform contamination layer averaging
    15-20 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter, primarily carbonaceous soot and fine
    silica dust, trapped within a matrix of organic residues like oils and polymers. The surface texture is highly irregular,
    with contamination filling the natural micro-pores of the stone, creating a topographically muted and occluded appearance.


    The contamination adheres tenaciously, forming dark, amorphous patches that contrast sharply with the underlying, lighter-colored
    soapstone mineralogy. The layer exhibits micro-fissuring, a result of differential thermal expansion between the contaminants
    and the stone substrate. This complex, multi-phase layer effectively masks the intrinsic granular structure and subtle
    cleavage planes of the talc-rich mineral composition, reducing surface reflectivity to an estimated 20-25%.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a distinct transformation, revealing the pristine, unaltered soapstone substrate. The
    15-20 micrometer contamination layer has been entirely removed via laser ablation, a process where focused light energy
    vaporizes surface contaminants without damaging the underlying stone. The surface now displays the characteristic platy,
    interlocking structure of the talc minerals, with individual grains and micro-crystalline boundaries clearly visible at
    500x magnification.


    The removal of the occluding layer restores the stone''s natural micro-topography. The surface reflectivity has increased
    significantly, now measuring approximately 38%, which is consistent with the inherent optical properties of clean soapstone.
    Crucially, the process has preserved the stone''s structural integrity; no thermal micro-fracturing or mineral phase changes
    are observed, confirming the laser parameters remained well below soapstone''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm². The intrinsic
    porosity of approximately 1.2% is now evident and free of foreign material.'
