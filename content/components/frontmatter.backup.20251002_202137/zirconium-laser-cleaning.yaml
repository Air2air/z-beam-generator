caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the zirconium surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer,
    measuring between 5-15 micrometers thick, consists of embedded particulate and a discontinuous oxide scale. The particulates
    appear as irregular, dark agglomerates scattered across the surface.


    The underlying zirconium''s typical polished texture (approximately 0.8 µm Ra) is completely masked. The contamination
    creates a topographically complex landscape with visible cracks and pores. This heterogeneous layer significantly alters
    the surface''s properties, increasing its roughness and providing sites for further corrosion or bacterial adhesion, which
    is critical in nuclear and food processing applications.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x view reveals a complete transformation. The heterogeneous contamination layer
    has been entirely removed, exposing the underlying zirconium substrate. The surface now displays the characteristic fine,
    uniform grain structure of the metal.


    The laser process has restored the surface to its intrinsic polished state, with a measured roughness near the original
    0.8 µm Ra. Minor, shallow micro-craters from the laser ablation process are visible, but no residual contamination or
    oxide scale remains. This results in a metallurgically clean surface, essential for achieving optimal performance in high-purity
    applications.'
