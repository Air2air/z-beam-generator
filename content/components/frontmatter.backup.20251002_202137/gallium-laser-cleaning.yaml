caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the gallium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 1-5 micrometers thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    carbonaceous deposits and discrete oxide particles, creating a topographically
    complex and rough texture. The underlying orthorhombic crystalline structure of
    the gallium is entirely masked. The contaminants form a mottled, high-contrast
    pattern that scatters light, significantly reducing the metal's inherent 71% reflectivity
    at 1064 nm.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine gallium substrate, restoring its
    characteristic metallic luster. The previously obscured orthorhombic crystalline
    grain structure is now clearly visible, with a uniform, low-roughness texture.
    The removal of the light-scattering contamination layer restores the surface's
    high optical reflectivity. This results in a microscopically clean and well-defined
    interface, free from the residual particulates common in mechanical cleaning methods.
