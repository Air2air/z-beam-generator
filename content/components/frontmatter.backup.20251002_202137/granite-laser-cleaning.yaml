caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the granite surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous film,
    ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers in thickness, coats the crystalline matrix. This layer consists of embedded particulate
    matter, such as carbon soot and fine silicates, within a matrix of hydrocarbon deposits and biological growth. The contaminants
    fill the natural micro-fissures and pores of the stone, creating a textured, uneven topography that masks the granite's
    intrinsic mineralogy and compromises its surface integrity.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis at 500x reveals a complete restoration of the granite's intrinsic
    surface. The contamination layer has been entirely removed via ablation, exposing the clean, interlocking crystals of
    quartz, feldspar, and mica. The stone's original micro-texture is now fully visible, with grain boundaries and natural
    porosity clearly defined and free of foreign material. The process has effectively eliminated subsurface contaminants
    without inducing micro-fractures or thermal alteration to the mineral lattice. This results in a surface with restored
    physical and aesthetic properties, characterized by its natural composition and minimal residual reflectivity of approximately
    0.15 at 1064 nm.
