caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the polypropylene surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, approximately
    5-15 micrometers thick. This layer appears as a discontinuous film of particulate matter and organic residues, creating
    a textured, topographically complex surface. The underlying polymer morphology is completely masked.


    The contamination exhibits a cracked-mud pattern, with agglomerated particles embedded in a matrix. This creates significant
    surface roughness, with height variations exceeding 10 micrometers. The native semi-crystalline structure of the polypropylene
    is not visible, as the contaminants prevent clear observation of the substrate''s intrinsic features.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface transformation is evident. The contamination layer has been completely
    removed, revealing the intrinsic semi-crystalline morphology of the polypropylene substrate. The surface is now uniform,
    with the laser-processed area showing a clean, micro-roughened texture characteristic of controlled ablation.


    The previously masked polymer spherulites are now clearly visible, confirming the contaminant''s removal down to the base
    material. The surface exhibits a consistent matte finish with sub-micrometer scale roughness, a direct result of the laser
    interacting with the polymer at its ablation threshold without causing bulk thermal damage.'
