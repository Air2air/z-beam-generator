caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead crystal surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. A particulate matrix, 5-15 µm thick, composed of environmental
    soot, dust, and organic residues, adheres to the substrate. This layer exhibits
    a high degree of micro-roughness, scattering light and masking the crystal's inherent
    refractive properties. The contaminants form a discontinuous, agglomerated crust,
    with localized penetration into micro-fissures, creating a visibly occluded and
    texturally heterogeneous surface that compromises optical clarity.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the pristine, homogeneous structure
    of the lead crystal. The 5-15 µm contamination layer has been entirely removed,
    restoring the substrate's native 0.02 µm Ra surface roughness. The interface is
    now optically transparent, with no evidence of micro-fracturing or subsurface
    damage. This restoration of the original surface geometry allows for unimpeded
    light transmission and brilliance.
