caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the MDF surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer, composed of embedded
    particulates and greasy films, fills the natural micro-porosity of the substrate.
    The underlying wood fibers are largely invisible, masked by this foreign material
    which creates a topographically uneven and texturally inconsistent surface. The
    contamination adheres within the fibrous matrix, disrupting the substrate's inherent
    uniformity and increasing surface roughness to an estimated 8-12 µm Ra.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the microscopic view reveals a complete restoration of
    the MDF's intrinsic surface morphology. The contaminant layer has been entirely
    removed, exposing the clean, undamaged wood fibers and the characteristic porous
    structure. The surface topography is now defined solely by the substrate's natural
    texture, with a measured roughness of approximately 3.2 µm Ra. The laser process
    has successfully ablated the foreign material without carbonizing the underlying
    fibers, resulting in a pristine, uniform surface ideal for subsequent finishing.
