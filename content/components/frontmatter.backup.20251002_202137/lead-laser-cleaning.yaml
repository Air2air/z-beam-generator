caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the lead surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A porous, stratified crust,
    measuring 10-50 µm thick, adheres to the substrate. This layer consists of a matrix of lead carbonates and sulfates, intermixed
    with embedded particulate matter. The underlying lead exhibits a smeared, plastically deformed texture from prior mechanical
    wear. Localized pitting, approximately 5-15 µm deep, is visible beneath the crust, indicating areas of active corrosion.
    The contamination forms an irregular, non-uniform blanket that masks the metal's original crystalline grain structure
    and significantly increases surface roughness.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has removed the contamination layer, revealing the underlying lead substrate. The surface now
    displays a distinct, recrystallized grain structure with clearly defined boundaries. The micro-pitting previously filled
    with corrosion products is now exposed but appears stable and non-propagating. The process has restored a uniform surface
    topography, significantly reducing the average roughness. The metal's inherent reflectivity is restored, presenting a
    clean, metallurgically intact surface free of foreign deposits.
