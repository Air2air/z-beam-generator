caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Hastelloy surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    oxides, carbonaceous soot, and salt deposits, forming a topographically complex
    crust. The underlying metal's fine grain structure is entirely masked. The surface
    exhibits a high degree of micro-roughness, with contamination filling the natural
    polishing lines and micro-pits of the alloy, creating a matte, non-reflective
    appearance that compromises the material's intrinsic properties.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, fine-grained, face-centered cubic
    microstructure of the Hastelloy substrate. The contamination layer has been completely
    ablated, exposing the original surface texture, including faint polishing marks
    and grain boundaries. The reflectivity is restored, with a characteristic metallic
    luster. The process selectively removes contaminants without melting the underlying
    alloy, preserving its mechanical integrity and corrosion-resistant surface. The
    result is a topographically uniform surface, free of embedded particulates, with
    a measured surface roughness (Sa) typically below 0.8 µm, returning the component
    to its specified functional condition.
