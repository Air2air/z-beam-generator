caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the iridium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of embedded
    carbonaceous soot, oxide particles from high-temperature exposure, and surface-adherent
    salts. The underlying iridium substrate, while possessing high intrinsic hardness
    (1760 MPa Vickers), exhibits a disrupted texture. Contaminants fill the native
    grain boundaries of the FCC crystalline structure, creating a matte, topographically
    complex surface that scatters light and masks the metal's inherent 78% reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine metallic surface, revealing the
    fine, continuous grain structure of the iridium substrate. At 500x, the surface
    is now characterized by a uniform, polished morphology with clearly defined grain
    boundaries. The removal of the contamination layer results in a specularly reflective
    finish, a direct result of exposing the bare metal with its high thermal conductivity
    (147 W/m·K) and exceptional oxidation resistance.
