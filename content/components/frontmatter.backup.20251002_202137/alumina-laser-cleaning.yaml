caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the alumina surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer consists of amorphous
    carbon deposits, embedded particulate, and surface-adherent oxides. The underlying
    polycrystalline alumina structure, characterized by its interlocking grain boundaries,
    is entirely masked. The contamination exhibits a mottled, textured appearance
    that disrupts the substrate's intrinsic surface morphology and increases diffuse
    light scattering.
  afterText: Laser cleaning reveals the pristine, polycrystalline microstructure of
    the alumina substrate. The contamination layer is completely removed, exposing
    well-defined grain boundaries and the intrinsic surface texture. The surface now
    exhibits minimal diffuse scattering, with a uniform appearance that confirms the
    restoration of the base material's properties without mechanical alteration or
    subsurface damage.
