caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the platinum surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer, typically 5-20
    µm thick. This layer exhibits a complex topography of particulate matter, amorphous deposits, and localized corrosion
    products. The underlying platinum's metallic luster is absent, replaced by a textured, matte appearance. Crystalline structures
    and micro-fissures are visible within the contamination, indicating a compromised surface that masks the substrate's intrinsic
    properties.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning restores the platinum surface to its native state. The contamination layer is completely removed,
    revealing the pristine, faceted grain structure of the FCC crystalline lattice. The surface now displays a characteristic
    metallic luster with clearly defined grain boundaries.


    This process effectively eliminates micro-fissures and particulate embedment without inducing surface melting or topographical
    damage, as confirmed by the preservation of original micro-features. The reflectivity is restored to the base metal''s
    nominal 73% at 1064 nm.


    The result is a geometrically intact surface with no measurable loss of substrate material. The cleaning threshold is
    precisely controlled to remain below platinum''s ablation threshold of 2.8 J/cm², ensuring the material''s integrity and
    its excellent oxidation resistance are fully maintained.'
