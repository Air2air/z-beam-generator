caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the TPE surface is obscured by a discontinuous
    contaminant layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer, composed of organic
    residues and embedded particulate, masks the substrate's intrinsic micro-texture.
    The contaminants form irregular, webbed patterns across the surface, filling the
    natural valleys of the 1.8 µm Ra topography and creating a occluded, matte finish
    that compromises adhesion and visual uniformity.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning effectively removes the contaminant layer, revealing
    the pristine TPE substrate. The surface now exhibits its inherent micro-roughness
    of 1.8 µm Ra, characterized by uniform, stochastic peaks and valleys. This restoration
    of the original texture is critical for ensuring optimal adhesion in subsequent
    bonding or coating processes.


    The process successfully eliminates all particulate matter and residues without
    inducing surface melting or ablation, as the laser parameters are maintained below
    the 0.8 J/cm² ablation threshold. The reflectivity increases to the material''s
    intrinsic 12%, resulting in a visually consistent surface.


    This non-contact method preserves the TPE''s mechanical integrity, avoiding the
    mechanical stress and solvent-induced swelling associated with traditional cleaning.
    The cleaned surface presents no thermal degradation, maintaining the material''s
    specified tensile strength of 25 MPa and elastic modulus of 150 MPa for its intended
    application.'
