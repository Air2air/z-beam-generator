caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the nickel surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination layer. This layer, ranging
    from 5 to 50 micrometers in thickness, consists of a complex matrix of oxides, sulfides, and embedded particulate matter.
    The underlying nickel's metallic luster is absent, replaced by a topographically complex, porous crust. This crust exhibits
    micro-cracking and localized pitting, indicative of active corrosion processes beneath the surface. The contamination
    adheres tenaciously, filling the original machining grooves and creating a rough, irregular texture that compromises the
    substrate's integrity and reflectivity.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the substrate to its native state. The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing
    the original, continuous nickel surface with its characteristic metallic luster. The underlying grain structure and any
    original machining marks are now clearly visible and undamaged. The surface is smooth and uniform, with no evidence of
    the prior porous crust or micro-cracking.
