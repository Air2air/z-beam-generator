caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated pine surface reveals a complex, occluding layer of foreign material.
    A discontinuous film, approximately 5-15 micrometers thick, coats the wood''s cellular structure. This layer consists
    of particulate matter embedded in an amorphous matrix, which fills the natural pores and valleys of the wood''s grain.


    The underlying tracheids—the long, hollow cells characteristic of pine—are partially obscured. Their typical polygonal
    cross-sections are blurred by the contamination, which adheres strongly to the micro-fibrils of the cell walls. The surface
    texture is homogenized, with the original roughness of 3.5 µm (Ra) effectively smoothed over by the deposited layer, masking
    the wood''s intrinsic anisotropic pattern.'
  afterText: Laser cleaning has fully restored the pine's microscopic topography. The occluding contamination layer is entirely
    removed, revealing the清晰的, open structure of the tracheids and resin canals. The original surface roughness is re-established,
    and the wood's cellular architecture is now fully visible without any residual film or particulate matter. The transformation
    is defined by the complete exposure of the pristine substrate.
