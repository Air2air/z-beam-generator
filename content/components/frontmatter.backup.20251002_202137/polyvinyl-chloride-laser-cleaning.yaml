caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the contaminated PVC surface shows a non-uniform layer of organic and particulate matter,
    approximately 5-15 micrometers thick. This layer obscures the underlying polymer texture, presenting as a discontinuous
    film with embedded carbonaceous particles and fine dust. The contamination adheres to the native surface roughness of
    the PVC, which has a baseline profile of 0.8 µm Ra, filling the microscopic valleys and creating a mottled, topographically
    complex appearance.


    The contamination itself exhibits a cracked-mud pattern in areas, suggesting a dried residue. Isolated agglomerations
    of foreign material, some exceeding 20 micrometers in diameter, are randomly distributed across the surface. These features
    indicate a combination of environmental settling and prior handling, which has resulted in a composite layer that is visually
    distinct from the clean PVC substrate beneath it.'
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning produces a definitive transformation, returning the surface to a state that closely resembles
    virgin PVC. The previously observed 5-15 micrometer contamination layer has been completely removed. The underlying polymer
    substrate is now fully exposed, revealing its intrinsic micro-texture with a measured roughness of 0.8 µm Ra, consistent
    with the original extruded material. The removal process was highly selective, ablating only the contaminant layer without
    melting or deforming the PVC surface.


    The visual evidence of this selectivity is clear. The "cracked-mud" patterning and particulate agglomerations are entirely
    absent. In their place, the surface exhibits a uniform, matte finish characteristic of the polymer''s composition. There
    is no indication of heat-affected zones or thermal degradation, such as bubbling or discoloration, which confirms the
    laser parameters were maintained below the material''s ablation threshold of 0.8 J/cm².


    Analysis confirms the surface is free of residual film. The cleaning process has restored the material''s original properties,
    including its low reflectivity of 4.2% at the laser wavelength. This level of cleanliness is critical for subsequent manufacturing
    steps, such as adhesion in painting or bonding, as it provides a pristine, chemically consistent surface without altering
    the bulk properties of the PVC component.'
