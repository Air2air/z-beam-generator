caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the beryllium surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, approximately 5-15 µm thick. This layer consists of particulate
    matter and a tenacious oxide film, creating a textured, matte topography. The
    underlying metallic grain structure is not visible, and the contamination exhibits
    a cracked, mudflat-like pattern, indicating poor adhesion and environmental exposure.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a stark transformation.
    The contamination layer has been completely removed, exposing the pristine, polycrystalline
    metallic substrate. The inherent grain structure of the beryllium is now clearly
    defined, with distinct grain boundaries visible across the surface.


    The laser process has restored a uniform, reflective finish with minimal topographical
    alteration. No evidence of melting, micro-cracking, or heat-affected zone is observed,
    confirming the ablation occurred below the material''s damage threshold. This
    results in a surface that is chemically clean and mechanically intact, restoring
    the base material''s properties.'
