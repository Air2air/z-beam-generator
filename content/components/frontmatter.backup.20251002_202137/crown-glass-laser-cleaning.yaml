caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the crown glass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, 5-20 µm in diameter, is embedded in a
    thin, amorphous film. This film, approximately 1-3 µm thick, exhibits a cracked,
    mudflat-like texture that scatters light and disrupts the substrate's inherent
    clarity. The underlying glass microstructure is entirely masked.
  afterText: 'Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. The contamination
    layer has been completely removed via selective laser ablation, revealing the
    pristine, homogeneous crown glass substrate. At 500x, the surface now exhibits
    a smooth, vitreous texture with no evidence of particulate embedment or residual
    film.


    The laser process has successfully ablated contaminants while operating below
    the material''s damage threshold of 15 J/cm². This precision ensures the glass''s
    intrinsic properties, such as its 1.523 refractive index and 72 GPa modulus, are
    fully preserved with no subsurface microfracturing or thermal stress marks.


    The transformation is evident in the restoration of optical clarity. Light transmission
    is no longer scattered by surface irregularities, and the interface is now defined
    by the material''s original hardness of 5.5 Mohs and low absorption coefficient.
    The surface is chemically stable and prepared for high-performance applications.'
