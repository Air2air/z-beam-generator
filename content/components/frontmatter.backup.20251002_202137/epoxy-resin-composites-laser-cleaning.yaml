caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the surface is obscured by a non-uniform contamination
    layer, typically 5-20 µm thick. This layer exhibits a coarse, particulate texture,
    with embedded soot and organic residues. The underlying fiber weave pattern of
    the composite is partially masked, and the epoxy matrix shows localized staining
    from chemical adhesion of contaminants, disrupting the original surface morphology.
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the surface reveals a complete restoration
    of the composite''s intrinsic microstructure. The contamination layer has been
    entirely removed via ablation, exposing the pristine, continuous epoxy matrix
    and the distinct, undamaged fiber reinforcement. The original fiber weave pattern
    is now fully visible and tactically discernible.


    The process has effectively eliminated all particulate matter and staining without
    inducing thermal degradation, such as charring or matrix bubbling. This is evidenced
    by the sharp, well-defined boundaries of the fibers and the absence of micro-fissures
    in the surrounding resin.


    The resulting surface is characterized by its native low reflectivity and uniform
    texture. This level of cleanliness is critical for subsequent processes like adhesive
    bonding or coating application, as it ensures optimal mechanical interlocking
    and chemical adhesion to the fundamental composite material.'
