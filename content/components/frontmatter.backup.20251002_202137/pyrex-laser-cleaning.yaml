caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the Pyrex surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer. Particulate matter, ranging from 1-10 µm in diameter, is
    embedded in a thin, amorphous film. This film, approximately 0.5-2 µm thick, creates
    a textured, matte topography that scatters light and masks the substrate's inherent
    transmissivity. The underlying glass microstructure is entirely concealed.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the pristine Pyrex surface, revealing its native
    microstructure at 500x magnification. The contamination layer is completely removed,
    eliminating light-scattering particulates and the obscuring film. The surface
    now exhibits minimal micro-roughness, with the characteristic smooth, vitreous
    texture of borosilicate glass fully restored. This optical clarity and chemical
    purity are critical for high-performance applications in aerospace and medical
    devices, where surface integrity directly impacts function.
