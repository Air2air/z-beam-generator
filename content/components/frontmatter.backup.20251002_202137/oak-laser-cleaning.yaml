caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the oak surface is obscured by a complex contamination layer. A discontinuous crust,
    measuring 50-200 micrometers thick, adheres to the wood's cellular structure. This layer consists of embedded particulate
    matter, soot agglomerates, and biological growth, which fill the porous vessel elements and obscure the natural grain
    texture. The contaminants exhibit poor adhesion, forming micro-fractures and delamination zones at the wood-contaminant
    interface. The underlying oak surface is not visible, and the overall topography is dominated by the irregular, crusted
    deposit.
  afterText: Following laser cleaning, microscopic analysis reveals the complete removal of the contamination crust, exposing
    the pristine oak substrate. The characteristic cellular anatomy, including large vessel elements and tracheids, is now
    clearly defined and free of foreign material. The laser process has selectively ablated the contaminants without measurable
    damage to the underlying wood structure, preserving the original cell wall integrity. The surface exhibits a uniform,
    clean micro-texture with restored porosity, confirming the non-contact and non-abrasive nature of the laser cleaning methodology.
    The visual transformation is defined by the restoration of the wood's intrinsic, undamaged surface morphology.
