caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the mahogany surface is obscured by a stratified contamination layer approximately 50-200
    µm thick. This layer consists of embedded particulate matter, such as silica and carbon, within a matrix of degraded organic
    films and oxidized finishes. The underlying wood cellular structure is partially occluded, with contaminants filling the
    porous lumen of vessels and fibers. The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination adhering more densely
    within the grain's recesses, creating a topographically complex and uneven profile that masks the wood's intrinsic anatomy.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its native state. The contamination layer is entirely removed, revealing
    the clean, open cellular structure of the mahogany. The surface topography is now defined by the wood's natural grain,
    with a significantly reduced roughness and clearly defined vessel elements.
