caption:
  beforeText: 'At 500x magnification, the redwood surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer averaging 50-200 micrometers in thickness. This layer consists
    of embedded particulate matter, biological growth, and a consolidated film of
    oxidized organic residues. The contaminants fill the wood''s natural porous structure,
    which has an average porosity of 65%, creating an uneven, matte topography that
    masks the underlying cellular detail.


    The surface texture is highly irregular, with contamination bridging across tracheid
    cells and vessel elements. The foreign material exhibits poor adhesion to the
    wood substrate in some areas, creating micro-fissures, while forming a dense,
    continuous crust in others. This heterogeneous layer significantly alters the
    surface''s thermal and optical properties, increasing its absorption of energy
    and reducing the visibility of the wood''s intrinsic grain pattern and cellular
    architecture.'
  afterText: 'Following laser cleaning, the 500x magnification reveals a surface transformation
    characterized by the complete removal of the contamination crust. The underlying
    redwood anatomy is now fully exposed, with clearly defined tracheid cells, medullary
    rays, and the distinctive porous structure. The original wood surface is intact,
    with no evidence of mechanical gouging or fiber tear-out associated with abrasive
    methods.


    The laser process has selectively ablated contaminants, which have an ablation
    threshold of approximately 1.8 J/cm², without exceeding redwood''s pyrolysis temperature
    of 380°C. This results in a clean substrate where the natural grain pattern and
    cellular details are visually prominent. The surface topography is uniform, with
    restored porosity and a texture dictated solely by the wood''s inherent biological
    structure, providing an optimal substrate for subsequent treatments.'
