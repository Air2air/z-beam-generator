caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the stoneware surface is obscured by a complex
    contamination layer. This stratum, measuring 10-50 micrometers thick, consists
    of particulate matter, carbonaceous deposits, and microbial biofilm. The contaminants
    fill the inherent micro-porosity (2.5%) of the vitrified ceramic, creating an
    irregular, matte topography that masks the underlying substrate's true morphology.
    The surface texture is highly heterogeneous, with agglomerated particles forming
    a discontinuous, weakly adhered crust. This layer significantly alters the surface's
    optical properties, increasing light scattering and reducing the inherent 15%
    reflectivity of the stoneware body.
  afterText: Laser cleaning has restored the surface to its intrinsic state. At 500x
    magnification, the contamination layer has been completely removed via selective
    laser ablation, a process requiring energy densities exceeding the material's
    2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold. The underlying stoneware matrix is now fully exposed,
    revealing a uniform, vitrified microstructure with a characteristic grain boundary
    network. The original micro-porosity is visible but free of foreign material,
    and the surface reflectivity has returned to its baseline of approximately 15%.
    The process has successfully eliminated subsurface contamination without inducing
    micro-fractures or thermal stress damage, preserving the ceramic's 45 MPa flexural
    strength and 70 GPa elastic modulus.
