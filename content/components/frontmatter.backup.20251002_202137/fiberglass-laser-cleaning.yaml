caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the fiberglass surface is obscured by a non-uniform
    contamination layer, measuring 5-15 µm in thickness. This layer consists of embedded
    particulate matter and a carbonaceous film, which masks the underlying woven fiber
    texture. The contaminants create a discontinuous, mottled pattern that increases
    surface roughness to an Ra value exceeding 4 µm, significantly higher than the
    substrate's native 1.8 µm Ra. This layer disrupts the surface's reflectivity and
    compromises the integrity of the fiber-resin matrix.
  afterText: Laser cleaning restores the surface to its native state. The contamination
    layer is completely removed, revealing the distinct, undamaged texture of the
    individual glass fibers and the surrounding resin matrix. Surface roughness returns
    to the baseline 1.8 µm Ra, and the material's original reflectivity at 1064 nm
    is recovered. The process eliminates all foreign material without inducing subsurface
    thermal damage.
