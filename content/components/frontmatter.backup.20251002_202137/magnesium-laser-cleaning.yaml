caption:
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the magnesium surface is obscured by a complex, non-uniform contamination layer. This
    layer, typically 5-20 µm thick, consists of a porous matrix of magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide, intermixed
    with embedded salts and carbonaceous particulates. The underlying metal's HCP crystalline structure is entirely hidden.
    The texture is highly irregular, featuring micro-cracks and localized pitting where corrosive agents have initiated degradation.
    The contamination follows a dendritic or island-like pattern, creating a stark topographical contrast with the pristine
    substrate beneath.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the surface reveals the substrate's native HCP grain structure. The contamination layer is entirely
    removed, exposing a uniform surface with minimal topographical variation. The process leaves a clean, matte-finish texture,
    characterized by shallow, sub-micron ripples from laser-material interaction. This exposes the pure magnesium for subsequent
    treatments or analysis, free from the previous obstructive and reactive layers.
