*   **Laser Parameters:** Optimal cleaning of silicon nitride typically employs nanosecond pulsed lasers at near-infrared wavelengths (e.g., 1064 nm) with carefully controlled fluence levels just above the contamination's ablation threshold but well below the substrate's damage threshold to preserve its structural integrity.
*   **Industrial Applications:** This non-contact process is critically deployed for precision cleaning of silicon nitride components in demanding sectors, including removing release agents from sintered ceramic substrates and decontaminating cutting tools and bearing surfaces prior to high-performance use.
*   **Safety Considerations:** Strict protocols for laser operation (enclosures, interlocks) are mandatory, complemented by robust fume extraction systems to capture airborne nanoparticles and ceramic dust liberated during the ablation of surface contaminants.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Laser cleaning eliminates the consumption and subsequent disposal of chemical solvents and abrasive media, significantly reducing hazardous waste streams and aligning with sustainable manufacturing initiatives.
