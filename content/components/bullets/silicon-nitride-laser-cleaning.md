• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Silicon Nitride benefits from 355nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes oxides, oils, coatings from Silicon Nitride without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for preparing Silicon Nitride surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Silicon Nitride, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
