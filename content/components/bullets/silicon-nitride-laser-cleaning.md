1. **Technical Focus:** Parameters - For silicon nitride in semiconductor tooling, a 1064 nm fiber laser with fluences between 1.5-2.5 J/cmÂ² and nanosecond pulses effectively ablates contaminants without damaging the underlying ceramic substrate.
2. **Technical Focus:** Applications - This non-contact process is critical for precision cleaning of etching components and wafer-handling robotics within high-volume electronics manufacturing facilities.
3. **Technical Focus:** Safety - Operators must utilize Class 1 enclosures and specialized fume extraction systems to mitigate exposure to airborne ceramic nanoparticles and direct beam hazards.
4. **Technical Focus:** Environmental Benefits - Laser cleaning eliminates the need for chemical solvents and abrasive media, drastically reducing hazardous waste streams from production lines.
