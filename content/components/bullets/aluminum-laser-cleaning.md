• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum works effectively with 355nm wavelength, delivering precise ablation while controlling thermal effects while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes environmental contaminants and buildup from Aluminum without mechanical contact, maintaining surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for cleaning critical Aluminum components, removing residues, and ensuring surface quality.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Demands careful parameter selection to prevent thermal stress and distortion of Aluminum, achieving thorough cleaning with minimal thermal impact on the base material.
