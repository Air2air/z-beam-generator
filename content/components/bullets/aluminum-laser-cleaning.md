• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum benefits from 1064nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes industrial deposits and films from Aluminum without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for preparing Aluminum surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Demands careful parameter selection to prevent thermal stress and distortion of Aluminum, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
