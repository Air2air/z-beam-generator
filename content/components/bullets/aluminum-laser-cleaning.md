• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum benefits from 266nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes environmental contaminants and buildup from Aluminum without mechanical contact, preserving substrate integrity and reducing material waste.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for restoring Aluminum surfaces, enhancing conductivity, and preparing for soldering or bonding.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Needs optimized laser settings to minimize thermal effects on sensitive Aluminum surfaces, ensuring efficient contamination removal without melting or warping the substrate.
