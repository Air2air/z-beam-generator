• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum responds well to 266nm wavelength lasers, providing optimal energy absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes industrial deposits and films from Aluminum without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in semiconductor, medical, and manufacturing industries for improving Aluminum surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Aluminum, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
