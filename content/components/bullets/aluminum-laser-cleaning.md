• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum exhibits high reflectivity, making the 532nm wavelength (common in pulsed fiber lasers) ideal for effective laser ablation while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Aluminum without mechanical contact, ensuring consistent cleaning results without mechanical stress.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for cleaning critical Aluminum components, removing residues, and ensuring surface quality.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Demands careful parameter selection to prevent thermal stress and distortion of Aluminum, delivering precise ablation without compromising structural characteristics.
