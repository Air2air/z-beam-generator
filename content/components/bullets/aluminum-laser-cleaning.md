• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum works effectively with 1064nm wavelength, delivering precise ablation while controlling thermal effects while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes environmental contaminants and buildup from Aluminum without mechanical contact, maintaining surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in semiconductor, medical, and manufacturing industries for preparing Aluminum surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Requires precise pulse duration and energy control to avoid excessive heat buildup in Aluminum, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
