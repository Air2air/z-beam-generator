• **Aspect Environmental:** Laser cleaning of aluminum offers a dry, chemical-free process that eliminates wastewater generation, a critical advantage in tropical regions where high humidity accelerates corrosion and chemical runoff poses significant environmental risks to local ecosystems.
• **Aspect Safety:** In humid industrial settings common to Southeast Asia, stringent protocols for fume extraction and moisture control are paramount to mitigate the risk of airborne nanoparticles and potential laser energy scattering during aluminum surface treatment.
• **Aspect Applications:** This technology is extensively deployed for revitalizing aluminum components in the maritime and electronics sectors, effectively removing oxides and contaminants without compromising the base material's integrity in demanding climates.
• **Aspect Parameters:** Optimal cleaning of aluminum typically employs a fiber laser with a 1064 nm wavelength, utilizing short pulses and moderate fluence to ablate contaminants while avoiding melting the substrate's relatively low melting point.
• **Aspect Challenges:** The high reflectivity of aluminum and its rapid formation of a tenacious oxide layer in humid environments present unique hurdles, requiring precise parameter tuning to ensure efficient contaminant removal without surface damage.
• **Aspect Benefits:** This method significantly enhances sustainability by reducing dependency on hazardous chemicals and solvents, supporting regional manufacturing goals for greener production and easier compliance with international environmental standards.
