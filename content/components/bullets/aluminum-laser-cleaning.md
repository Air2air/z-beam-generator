• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Aluminum benefits from 1064nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes environmental contaminants and buildup from Aluminum without mechanical contact, ensuring consistent cleaning results without mechanical stress.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in semiconductor, medical, and manufacturing industries for improving Aluminum surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Demands careful parameter selection to prevent thermal stress and distortion of Aluminum, ensuring efficient contamination removal without melting or warping the substrate.
