• **Aspect Environmental:** Laser cleaning of porcelain offers a sustainable dry process that eliminates chemical waste and water usage, a critical advantage in regions with high humidity where traditional methods can accelerate mold growth and material degradation.
• **Aspect Safety:** Operators must utilize specialized fume extraction systems to manage the fine ceramic particulate aerosolized during the process, which is a heightened concern in enclosed tropical industrial environments.
• **Aspect Applications:** This technique is predominantly applied for the meticulous restoration of heritage architectural ceramics and for precision pre-treatment in high-value porcelain component manufacturing prior to coating or bonding.
• **Aspect Parameters:** An Nd:YAG laser operating at a 1064 nm wavelength with a fluence range of 0.5-1.5 J/cm² and nanosecond pulses is typically employed to effectively ablate contaminants without damaging the vitreous glaze.
• **Aspect Challenges:** The primary technical hurdle involves calibrating the laser's energy to remove stubborn biological films or pollutants without inducing micro-cracks in the brittle substrate, a process complicated by varying surface geometries.
• **Aspect Benefits:** This non-abrasive method significantly enhances manufacturing quality control by providing a reproducible and selective cleaning process that preserves the integrity of delicate porcelain surfaces.
