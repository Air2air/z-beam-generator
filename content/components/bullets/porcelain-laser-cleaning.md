• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Porcelain exhibits high reflectivity, making the 355nm wavelength (common in pulsed fiber lasers) ideal for effective laser ablation while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Porcelain without mechanical contact, preserving substrate integrity and reducing material waste.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for improving Porcelain surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Porcelain, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
