• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Epoxy Resin Composites exhibits high reflectivity, making the 266nm wavelength (common in pulsed fiber lasers) ideal for effective laser ablation while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Epoxy Resin Composites without mechanical contact, maintaining surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in semiconductor, medical, and manufacturing industries for improving Epoxy Resin Composites surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Requires precise pulse duration and energy control to avoid excessive heat buildup in Epoxy Resin Composites, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
