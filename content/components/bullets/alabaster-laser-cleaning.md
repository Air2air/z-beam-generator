1. **Technical Focus:** Parameters - For alabaster, optimal cleaning employs a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser with fluence precisely controlled at 0.8-1.2 J/cmÂ² and nanosecond pulse durations to effectively ablate sulfated black crusts without damaging the underlying gypsum matrix, a precision requirement shared with semiconductor wafer processing.
2. **Technical Focus:** Applications - This technique is predominantly applied in the meticulous restoration of historical monuments and delicate electronic component manufacturing, where the non-abrasive removal of contaminants from sensitive surfaces is paramount.
3. **Technical Focus:** Safety - Operators must utilize specialized eyewear rated for the specific 1064 nm wavelength and employ advanced fume extraction systems to mitigate inhalation risks from the ejected gypsum particulate matter generated during the ablation process.
4. **Technical Focus:** Environmental Benefits - The process eliminates the need for chemical solvents and minimizes aqueous waste, offering a dry, eco-conscious cleaning alternative that aligns with stringent global environmental regulations for industrial operations.
