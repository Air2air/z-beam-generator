*   **Laser Parameters:** Optimal cleaning of alumina, a high-melting-point ceramic, typically employs near-infrared fiber lasers (1064 nm) with nanosecond pulse durations and fluences carefully controlled between 1-5 J/cmÂ² to effectively ablate contaminants without inducing micro-cracking in the substrate.
*   **Industrial Applications:** This non-abrasive technique is precisely deployed for restoring high-voltage electrical insulators, preparing surfaces for thermal spray coatings, and delicately removing oxidation from precision components within the aerospace and energy sectors.
*   **Safety Considerations:** Strict protocols mandating Class 1 enclosures or personal protective equipment (PPE) including wavelength-specific laser safety eyewear are non-negotiable to mitigate risks from reflected beams and airborne particulates generated during the ablation process.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Laser cleaning eliminates the need for chemical solvents and abrasive media, drastically reducing hazardous waste streams and aligning with sustainable manufacturing initiatives by offering a completely dry and consumable-free process.
