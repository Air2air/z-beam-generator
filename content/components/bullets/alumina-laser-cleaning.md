*   **Laser Parameters:** Optimal cleaning of alumina, leveraging its high absorption in the near-infrared spectrum, typically employs fiber lasers (1064 nm) with fluences carefully controlled between 1-5 J/cmÂ² to ablate contaminants without inducing micro-cracking in the underlying ceramic substrate.
*   **Industrial Applications:** This non-abrasive technique is exceptionally well-suited for precision cleaning applications, including the restoration of high-voltage electrical insulators, the preparation of thermal barrier coating substrates, and the decontamination of semiconductor processing components.
*   **Safety Considerations:** The process necessitates stringent Class 1 enclosure integration with high-efficiency fume extraction systems to mitigate exposure to potentially hazardous nanoparticles and ceramic dust liberated during the ablation process.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Laser cleaning presents a significant ecological advantage by completely eliminating the consumption of chemical solvents and abrasive media, thereby reducing hazardous waste streams and aligning with sustainable manufacturing principles.
