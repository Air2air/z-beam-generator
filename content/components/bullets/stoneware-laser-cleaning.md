*   **Definition:** A type of ceramic made from a specific clay that is fired at temperatures between 2,100°F and 2,400°F (1,150°C and 1,300°C).
*   **The Firing Process:** The high firing temperature causes the clay to vitrify, becoming glass-like and impermeable to water, even without a glaze.
*   **Comparison to Earthenware:** Stronger, less porous, and more chip-resistant than earthenware (like terracotta).
*   **Comparison to Porcelain:** Typically less white and more opaque than porcelain, with a heavier and more rustic feel, though equally durable for dinnerware.
*   **Glaze:** The glaze is not just decorative; it fuses with the clay body during firing, creating an integral, non-porous surface that is easy to clean and food-safe.
*   **Longevity:** With proper care, high-quality stoneware is incredibly durable and can last for decades, becoming a staple in your kitchen.
