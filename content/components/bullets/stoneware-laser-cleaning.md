• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Stoneware responds well to 266nm wavelength lasers, providing optimal energy absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes industrial deposits and films from Stoneware without mechanical contact, maintaining surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in aerospace, marine, and industrial equipment industries for cleaning critical Stoneware components, removing residues, and ensuring surface quality.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Needs optimized laser settings to minimize thermal effects on sensitive Stoneware surfaces, achieving thorough cleaning with minimal thermal impact on the base material.
