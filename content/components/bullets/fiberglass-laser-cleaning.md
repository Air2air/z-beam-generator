• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Fiberglass exhibits high reflectivity, making the 266nm wavelength (common in pulsed fiber lasers) ideal for effective laser ablation while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes oxides, oils, coatings from Fiberglass without mechanical contact, ensuring consistent cleaning results without mechanical stress.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in aerospace, marine, and industrial equipment industries for restoring Fiberglass surfaces, enhancing conductivity, and preparing for soldering or bonding.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Needs optimized laser settings to minimize thermal effects on sensitive Fiberglass surfaces, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
