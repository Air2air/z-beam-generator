• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel exhibits high reflectivity, making the 266nm wavelength (common in pulsed fiber lasers) ideal for effective laser ablation while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Steel without mechanical contact, preserving substrate integrity and reducing material waste.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in semiconductor, medical, and manufacturing industries for preparing Steel surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Demands careful parameter selection to prevent thermal stress and distortion of Steel, delivering precise ablation without compromising structural characteristics.
