• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel benefits from 1064nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes industrial deposits and films from Steel without mechanical contact, preserving substrate integrity and reducing material waste.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in aerospace, marine, and industrial equipment industries for cleaning critical Steel components, removing residues, and ensuring surface quality.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Requires precise pulse duration and energy control to avoid excessive heat buildup in Steel, ensuring efficient contamination removal without melting or warping the substrate.
