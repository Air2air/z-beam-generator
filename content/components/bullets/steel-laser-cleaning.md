• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel works effectively with 1064nm wavelength, delivering precise ablation while controlling thermal effects while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Steel without mechanical contact, ensuring consistent cleaning results without mechanical stress.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in automotive, electronics, and precision engineering industries for preparing Steel surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Steel, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
