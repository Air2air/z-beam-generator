• **Aspect Environmental:** The laser ablation process for steel surfaces generates minimal secondary waste compared to chemical or abrasive methods, a critical advantage for Indonesia's strict industrial waste management protocols in its sensitive tropical ecosystems.
• **Aspect Safety:** High-humidity environments prevalent in the region necessitate enhanced electrical insulation and dedicated fume extraction systems to manage the potentially reactive plume generated from cleaning coated or corroded steel substrates.
• **Aspect Applications:** This technology is predominantly deployed for revitalizing structural steel in maritime and power generation sectors, effectively removing mill scale, corrosion, and paint without compromising the base material integrity.
• **Aspect Parameters:** A fiber laser wavelength of 1064 nm is typically employed with fluences between 1-10 J/cm² and nanosecond pulse durations to optimally ablate contaminants from steel while preserving the substrate beneath the surface layer.
• **Aspect Challenges:** The primary technical hurdle involves calibrating energy density to prevent unintended surface etching on softer steel grades, a process complicated by the varying contamination layers found on components from local manufacturing.
• **Aspect Benefits:** This non-contact method significantly reduces water consumption and eliminates hazardous chemical solvents, aligning with sustainable manufacturing goals and enhancing operational safety within regional industrial complexes.
