• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel benefits from 532nm laser systems, which offer excellent coupling efficiency for surface cleaning while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes industrial deposits and films from Steel without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in automotive, electronics, and precision engineering industries for improving Steel surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Steel, achieving thorough cleaning with minimal thermal impact on the base material.
