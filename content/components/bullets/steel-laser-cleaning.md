• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel responds well to 266nm wavelength lasers, providing optimal energy absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Steel without mechanical contact, preserving substrate integrity and reducing material waste.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in aerospace, marine, and industrial equipment industries for preparing Steel surfaces for coating, improving adhesion, and extending component life.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Benefits from controlled energy delivery to prevent unwanted modification of Steel, delivering precise ablation without compromising structural characteristics.
