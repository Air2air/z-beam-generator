• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Steel responds well to 1064nm wavelength lasers, providing optimal energy absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes surface contaminants and residues from Steel without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in aerospace, marine, and industrial equipment industries for improving Steel surface finish, removing coatings, and preparing for further processing.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Requires precise pulse duration and energy control to avoid excessive heat buildup in Steel, providing effective cleaning while maintaining material integrity and properties.
