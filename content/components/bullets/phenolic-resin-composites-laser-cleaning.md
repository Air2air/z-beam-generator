• **Optimal Wavelength for Laser Cleaning**: Phenolic Resin Composites responds well to 266nm wavelength lasers, providing optimal energy absorption for contaminant removal while minimizing thermal damage.

• **Non-Contact Precision Cleaning**: Laser cleaning removes oxides, oils, coatings from Phenolic Resin Composites without mechanical contact, providing selective removal without affecting base material properties.

• **Industrial Applications**: Widely used in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries for restoring Phenolic Resin Composites surfaces, enhancing conductivity, and preparing for soldering or bonding.

• **Thermal Processing Considerations**: Needs optimized laser settings to minimize thermal effects on sensitive Phenolic Resin Composites surfaces, ensuring efficient contamination removal without melting or warping the substrate.
