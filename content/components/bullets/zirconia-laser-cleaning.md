*   **Laser Parameters:** Optimal cleaning of zirconia ceramics typically employs near-infrared fiber lasers with nanosecond pulse durations, carefully controlling fluence to ablate contaminants without inducing micro-cracking or phase transformation in the tough substrate.
*   **Industrial Applications:** This non-abrasive technique is indispensable for precision cleaning of zirconia components in medical implants and electronics, where absolute surface purity and dimensional integrity are non-negotiable.
*   **Safety Considerations:** The process necessitates robust Class 1 enclosures and fume extraction systems to contain hazardous nanoparticles and intense reflected beams inherent to cleaning highly reflective ceramic surfaces.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Laser cleaning eliminates the consumption of chemical solvents and abrasive media, significantly reducing hazardous waste streams and aligning with sustainable manufacturing initiatives.
