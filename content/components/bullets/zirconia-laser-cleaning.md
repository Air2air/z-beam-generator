*   **Laser Parameters:** The optimal laser cleaning parameters for zirconia typically involve nanosecond-pulsed fiber lasers operating at a 1064 nm wavelength, utilizing a fluence range of 2-6 J/cmÂ² to effectively ablate surface contaminants without inducing micro-cracking in the underlying ceramic substrate.
*   **Industrial Applications:** This non-abrasive technique is predominantly applied for precision cleaning of zirconia components in the medical and aerospace sectors, including the removal of release agents from sintered dental prosthetics and de-coating turbine blade thermal barrier coatings for refurbishment.
*   **Safety Considerations:** Strict adherence to Class 4 laser safety protocols is mandatory, requiring the use of wavelength-specific protective eyewear and engineered enclosures with interlocks to mitigate risks from reflected radiation and the inhalation of potentially hazardous aerosolized particles.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Laser cleaning presents a significant ecological advantage over traditional chemical or mechanical methods by completely eliminating the consumption of solvents and abrasive media, thereby producing zero liquid waste streams and only requiring filtration of minimal solid particulate waste.
