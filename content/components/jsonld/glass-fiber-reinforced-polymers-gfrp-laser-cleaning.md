Of course. Here is the JSON-LD structured data for a webpage about Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP), generated from typical frontmatter data and enhanced for a comprehensive semantic markup.

I'll first show you an example of the frontmatter data that might be used, and then generate the JSON-LD from it.

### 2. Generated JSON-LD Content

Based on the frontmatter above and extending it with specific details about GFRP, here is the rich, multi-typed JSON-LD snippet.
