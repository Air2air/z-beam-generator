Of course. Here is the JSON-LD structured data for a Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) product page, generated from typical frontmatter data.

I'll first show you an example of what the frontmatter might look like (in YAML format, commonly used in static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll), and then generate the corresponding JSON-LD.

### 2. Generated JSON-LD Code

This JSON-LD uses a combination of `Product` and `HowTo` (for material properties) to provide rich, detailed information for search engines.
