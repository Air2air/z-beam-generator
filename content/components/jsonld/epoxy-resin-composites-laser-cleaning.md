Of course. Here is a comprehensive JSON-LD structured data snippet for an Epoxy Resin Composite product, generated based on common frontmatter data you might find on a product page.

I'll first show you an example of what the frontmatter might look like (in YAML format, common in systems like Hugo or Jekyll), and then generate the corresponding JSON-LD.

### 2. Generated JSON-LD Code

This code uses the `Product` and `Offer` schemas, and incorporates specific properties for a composite material.
