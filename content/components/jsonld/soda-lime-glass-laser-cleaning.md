    "description": "Soda-lime glass, also known as soda-lime-silica glass, is the most prevalent type of glass, used for windows, containers, and many other applications. It is composed primarily of silica (SiO₂), soda (sodium oxide, Na₂O), and lime (calcium oxide, CaO), which act as a flux and stabilizer, respectively.",
