Of course. I'll generate JSON-LD structured data for a steel product page, assuming some common frontmatter data you might have.

### 1. Example Frontmatter Data

Let's assume your markdown file or CMS has the following frontmatter for a specific steel product:

```yaml
---
title: "A500 Grade B Structural Steel Square Tube"
description: "High-strength, cold-formed structural carbon steel tubing, ideal for construction, frames, and supports. Available in various sizes."
product_id: "STL-A500-B-50x50x3.2"
sku: "STL500B5032"
brand: "SteelWorks Inc."
price: 89.99
price_currency: "USD"
availability: "InStock"
images:
  - "/images/steel-tube-1.jpg"
  - "/images/steel-tube-2.jpg"
product_url: "/products/structural-steel/a500-grade-b-tube"
weight_value: 4.5
weight_unit: "kg"
material: "Carbon Steel"
---
```

### 2. Generated JSON-LD Code

Based on the frontmatter above, here is the corresponding JSON-LD structured data. This helps search engines understand your product and can make it eligible for rich results.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "A500 Grade B Structural Steel Square Tube",
  "description": "High-strength, cold-formed structural carbon steel tubing, ideal for construction, frames, and supports. Available in various sizes.",
  "sku": "STL500B5032",
  "productID": "STL-A500-B-50x50x3.2",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "SteelWorks Inc."
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "url": "/products/structural-steel/a500-grade-b-tube",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "price": 89.99,
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock",
    "itemCondition": "https://schema.org/NewCondition"
  },
  "image": [
    "/images/steel-tube-1.jpg",
    "/images/steel-tube-2.jpg"
  ],
  "weight": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "value": 4.5,
    "unitCode": "KGM"
  },
  "additionalProperty": {
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "name": "Material",
    "value": "Carbon Steel"
  }
}
```

### 3. How to Implement This on Your Page

You should place this JSON-LD code within a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>A500 Grade B Structural Steel Square Tube | Your Company</title>
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      // ... The JSON-LD code from above goes here ...
    }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your page content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. Key Properties Explained:

*   **`@type`: "Product"**: Tells search engines this is data about a product.
*   **`sku` & `productID`**: Unique identifiers for inventory and product management.
*   **`offers`**: A nested `Offer` object containing crucial commercial information like price, currency, and availability.
*   **`availability`**: Uses a Schema.org URL to specify stock status (e.g., `InStock`, `OutOfStock
