Of course. Here is the JSON-LD structured data for a webpage about "Phenolic Resin Composites," generated based on common frontmatter data you might find on a technical product page.

This example uses the `Product` and `HowTo` schemas to cover both the material's properties and potential usage instructions.

### 1. Standard Product/Technical Data Page

This is the most common use case, focusing on the material as a product with specific properties.
