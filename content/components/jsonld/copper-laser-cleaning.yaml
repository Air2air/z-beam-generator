  "articleBody": "Laser cleaning of Copper is a highly specialized industrial process that leverages the unique thermal and optical properties of Copper. The primary laser wavelength used is 1064nm (near-infrared), as Copper exhibits strong absorption at this wavelength, facilitating efficient energy transfer. An optional frequency-doubled 532nm (green) wavelength is available for applications requiring finer control or dealing with specific thin-film contaminants. The process is optimized for Copper's high thermal conductivity (50.2 W/m·K), which rapidly dissipates heat, and its melting point range of 1370-1530°C. Laser parameters are precisely tuned to exceed the vaporization threshold of surface contaminants while remaining below the ablation threshold of the pure Copper substrate. This is achieved using a power range of 50-200W, ultra-short pulses of 20-100 nanoseconds, and a high repetition rate of 20-100kHz. The small spot size, adjustable from 0.2mm to 1.5mm, allows for exceptional precision, making it ideal for intricate components. Key industrial applications include Electronics Manufacturing, where it removes surface oxides and organic residues from Copper lead frames, connectors, and PCB substrates to ensure optimal electrical conductivity and solderability. In the Aerospace sector, it is employed for cleaning thermal barrier coatings from Copper-based heat exchanger components and for preparing surfaces of metal matrix composites. The process offers significant environmental benefits by completely eliminating the need for chemical solvents, acids, and alkaline cleaners, thereby preventing hazardous waste generation and VOC emissions. It also contributes to substantial water conservation by being a completely dry process, requiring no rinsing or water-based slurries.",
