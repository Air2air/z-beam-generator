Of course. Here is the JSON-LD structured data for a Zirconia product page, generated based on common frontmatter data fields.

I'll provide two versions:
1.  **A generic version** using `Product` and `Offer`.
2.  **A more specific, recommended version** using the `Product` type with a `material` property for better specificity.

### Version 1: Generic Product & Offer Schema

This is a good baseline that works for any product.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "@id": "https://yourdomain.com/products/zirconia-necklace#product", 
  "name": "Brilliant Cut Zirconia Pendant Necklace",
  "description": "A stunning necklace featuring a precision-cut zirconia stone set in 14k white gold. A brilliant and affordable alternative to diamond jewelry.",
  "image": "https://yourdomain.com/images/zirconia-necklace-main.jpg",
  "sku": "ZC-NG-1024",
  "gtin": "0987543210987", 
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "Luxury Gem Co."
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "@id": "https://yourdomain.com/products/zirconia-necklace#offer",
    "url": "https://yourdomain.com/products/zirconia-necklace",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "price": "129.99",
    "priceValidUntil": "2024-12-31",
    "itemCondition": "https://schema.org/NewCondition",

    "shippingDetails": {

      "shippingRate": {
        "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
        "value": "5.99",
        "currency": "USD"
      },
      "shippingDestination": {
        "@type": "DefinedRegion",
        "addressCountry": "US"
      },
      "deliveryTime": {
        "@type": "ShippingDeliveryTime",
        "handlingTime": {
          "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
          "minValue": "1",
          "maxValue": "2"
        },
        "transitTime": {
          "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
          "minValue": "3",
          "maxValue": "5"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Version 2: Recommended Specific Schema (with `material`)

This version is more precise because it explicitly states that the product's material is `Zirconia`, which is excellent for SEO and clarity.

```json

  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "@id": "https://yourdomain.com/products/zirconia-necklace#product",
  "name": "Brilliant Cut Zirconia Pendant Necklace",
  "description": "A stunning necklace featuring a precision-cut zirconia stone set in 14k white gold. A brilliant and affordable alternative to diamond jewelry.",
  "image": [
    "https://yourdomain.com/images/zirconia-necklace-main.jpg",
    "https://yourdomain.com/images/zirconia-necklace-closeup.jpg",
    "https://yourdomain.com/images/zirconia-necklace-model.jpg"
  ],
  "sku": "ZC-NG-1024",
  "mpn": "ZC2024S", 
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "Luxury Gem Co."
  },
  "material": "Zir
