Of course. Here is the JSON-LD structured data for a webpage about Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs), generated based on common frontmatter data you might find on such a page.

This example assumes the webpage is an educational/article page. The JSON-LD uses Schema.org types like `Article` and `HowTo` to provide rich context to search engines.
