caption:
  beforeText: The microscopy image of the contaminated Ceramic Matrix Composite surface
    reveals adhered fine particulates and oily residues on fibers and matrix. These
    contaminants, sized 5-40 microns, form irregular clusters in pores and low spots,
    creating uneven coverage. This buildup causes surface degradation, including micro-cracks
    at interfaces and mild pitting. And it shows the need for cleaning to avoid further
    wear and preserve integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the CMC surface appears smooth and residue-free.
    It demonstrates high restoration quality, preserving material integrity.

          of a silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composite (SiC/SiC
          CMC), a common and well-documented type. For this class of material, compressive
          strength is significantly lower than its tensile strength and is highly
          dependent on the fiber architecture and matrix porosity. The cited value
          of 350 MPa is a representative lower-bound figure for the compressive strength
          of 2D woven SiC/SiC CMCs at room temperature, as established in materials
          databases for aerospace applications. The confidence is not higher because
          the exact fiber type, weave, and interfacial coating of the specific CMC
          in question are unknown, which can cause the value to vary by ±150 MPa.

      corrosionResistance:
        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.9
        research_basis: CMCs are inherently resistant to corrosion due to their ceramic
          constituents (e.g., SiC, Al2O3), which are stable and do not readily undergo
          electrochemical oxidation like metals. They exhibit excellent resistance
          to oxidation and various corrosive environments, especially at high temperatures.
          The rating is not a perfect 10 because specific CMC systems (e.g., with
          certain non-oxide fibers/interphases) can be susceptible to oxidation or
          hot corrosion in extreme conditions, and performance is highly dependent
          on the specific matrix/fiber combination.

        research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for CMCs is highly dependent
          on the specific matrix and fiber composition (e.g., SiC/SiC). For the most
          common and commercially significant SiC-based CMCs with environmental barrier
          coatings (EBCs), the maximum continuous use temperature in air is typically
          cited as 1650°C. Below this temperature, the protective silica scale forms
          and provides oxidation resistance. Above this threshold, the silica scale
          becomes volatile and active oxidation occurs, leading to significant material
          recession.
