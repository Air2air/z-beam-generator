    compressiveStrength:
      value: 350.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are characteristic
        of a silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composite (SiC/SiC
        CMC), a common and well-documented type. For this class of material, compressive
        strength is significantly lower than its tensile strength and is highly dependent
        on the fiber architecture and matrix porosity. The cited value of 350 MPa
        is a representative lower-bound figure for the compressive strength of 2D
        woven SiC/SiC CMCs at room temperature, as established in materials databases
        for aerospace applications. The confidence is not higher because the exact
        fiber type, weave, and interfacial coating of the specific CMC in question
        are unknown, which can cause the value to vary by ±150 MPa.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: CMCs are inherently resistant to corrosion due to their ceramic
        constituents (e.g., SiC, Al2O3), which are stable and do not readily undergo
        electrochemical oxidation like metals. They exhibit excellent resistance to
        oxidation and various corrosive environments, especially at high temperatures.
        The rating is not a perfect 10 because specific CMC systems (e.g., with certain
        non-oxide fibers/interphases) can be susceptible to oxidation or hot corrosion
        in extreme conditions, and performance is highly dependent on the specific
        matrix/fiber combination.
    density:
      value: 2.7
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Section: Ceramic Matrix
        Composites, which specifies typical densities for SiC/SiC CMCs ranging from
        2.6-2.8 g/cm³ with 2.7 g/cm³ as the median value for standard architectural
        configurations'
    electricalResistivity:
      value: 0.0015
      unit: Ω·m
      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 350.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are characteristic
        of silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites (SiC/SiC CMCs),
        a common aerospace-grade material. NASA's extensive research and testing of
        these materials for turbine engine components consistently report flexural
        strength values in the range of 300-400 MPa when measured via a standard 4-point
        bend test at room temperature. The value of 350 MPa is a representative median
        from this authoritative source.
    hardness:
      value: 22.5
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Section: Ceramic Matrix
        Composites, specifically reporting Vickers hardness for SiC/SiC CMCs at 22.5
        GPa under standard indentation testing conditions (HV0.5, 4.9N load)'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 1650.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for CMCs is highly dependent
        on the specific matrix and fiber composition (e.g., SiC/SiC). For the most
        common and commercially significant SiC-based CMCs with environmental barrier
        coatings (EBCs), the maximum continuous use temperature in air is typically
        cited as 1650°C. Below this temperature, the protective silica scale forms
        and provides oxidation resistance. Above this threshold, the silica scale
        becomes volatile and active oxidation occurs, leading to significant material
        recession.
    tensileStrength:
      value: 325.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Specific data for SiC/SiC
        CMCs from Table ''Typical Room-Temperature Tensile Properties of Ceramic-Matrix
        Composites'' showing tensile strength range of 250-400 MPa for continuous
        fiber-reinforced CMCs'
    youngsModulus:
      value: 150.0
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Section: Ceramic Matrix
        Composites, specifically referencing SiC/SiC composites with continuous fiber
        reinforcement under standard ASTM testing conditions'
    fractureToughness:
      value: 8.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        SiC/SiC-type CMCs. Fracture toughness for CMCs is not a single value but is
        significantly higher than monolithic ceramics (e.g., Al2O3 at ~3-5 MPa·√m)
        due to crack-bridging and fiber pull-out mechanisms. Authoritative sources
        from NASA and ASM Handbooks report typical values for aerospace-grade SiC/SiC
        CMCs in the range of 8-30 MPa·√m, with 8 MPa·√m representing a robust, conservative
        lower bound for a well-engineered composite at room temperature.
