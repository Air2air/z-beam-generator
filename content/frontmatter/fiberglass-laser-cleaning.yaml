    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1034.0
      min: 50
      max: 1000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of fiberglass is highly dependent on
        the specific resin system, fiber type (e.g., E-glass, S-glass), and fiber
        orientation. For a general-purpose E-glass fiber-reinforced polymer composite,
        authoritative materials databases (AZoM, MatWeb) consistently report compressive
        strength values in the range of 480-1600 MPa. The provided value of 1034 MPa
        is a typical mid-range value for a unidirectional E-glass/epoxy composite,
        which is significantly lower than its tensile strength due to different failure
        mechanisms (fiber buckling/kinking under compression).
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 5
      max: 9
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Fiberglass (glass fiber reinforced polymer) exhibits excellent
        resistance to most environmental corrosion including atmospheric exposure,
        water, and many chemicals due to the protective polymer matrix and inert glass
        fibers. It does not rust or corrode like metals, though it can experience
        some degradation from UV exposure and strong alkalis over very long periods.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 689.0
      min: 100
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided tensile strength (3447 MPa) is exceptionally high
        for a bulk fiberglass composite, more typical of individual glass fibers.
        For a standard fiberglass-reinforced polymer (GRP/FRP), authoritative engineering
        databases (AZoM, MatWeb) list flexural strength values in the range of 200-800
        MPa. The cited value of 689 MPa is a representative high-end value for a unidirectional
        or high-fiber-volume E-glass/epoxy composite, which aligns with the expected
        relationship where flexural strength is significantly lower than the ultimate
        fiber tensile strength but higher than the matrix-dominated compressive strength.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 340.0
      min: 80.0
      max: 1650.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Fiberglass is a composite material, and its maximum service
        temperature is dictated by the polymer matrix (typically epoxy or polyester),
        not the glass fibers. Authoritative materials databases (AZoM, MatWeb) consistently
        report the maximum continuous service temperature for standard fiberglass
        composites in air to be in the range of 140-350°C, with 340°C being a common
        upper limit for high-temperature epoxy systems before the resin begins to
        thermally degrade and oxidize.
