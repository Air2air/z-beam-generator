  beforeText: Under microscopy, the fiberglass surface shows contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues embedded
    among the fibers. This buildup leads to surface degradation, with visible pitting and slight fiber fraying.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the fiberglass surface appears smooth and evenly restored to its original luster. No fiber
    damage or delamination shows, preserving the composite's integrity well, and it retains full strength for ongoing applications.

faq:
- question: Can you safely use a laser cleaner to remove paint or contamination from a fiberglass surface?
  answer: Laser cleaning is strongly discouraged for fiberglass composites. The polymer resin readily absorbs near-infrared
    energy at 1064 nm, leading to thermal degradation. Even at a conservative 5 J/cm² fluence, the resin matrix can burn and
    vaporize, catastrophically compromising the material's structural integrity.
- question: What happens to fiberglass when it's hit with a laser during cleaning?
  answer: The 1064 nm laser energy is strongly absorbed by the polymer resin, causing rapid thermal decomposition and ablation
    at fluences around 5 J/cm². This process leaves behind exposed, frayed glass fibers and a charred surface, which critically
    degrades the material's structural integrity. The composite is simply not suited for this cleaning method.
- question: Are there any specific laser types or settings (wavelength, power) that make cleaning fiberglass less destructive?
  answer: While UV lasers at 5 J/cm² reduce thermal effects, fiberglass remains highly vulnerable. The resin matrix can still
    degrade even with optimized ns-pulse settings. Most industrial systems risk material damage, making this application generally
    unsuitable.
- question: What is the best alternative to laser cleaning for preparing or restoring fiberglass surfaces?
  answer: For fiberglass restoration, gentle mechanical abrasion with plastic media or chemical stripping are preferred. These
    methods avoid the thermal risks of laser processing, which requires precise control below 5 J/cm² to prevent resin degradation
    in the composite matrix.
- question: If a laser accidentally contacts fiberglass, what kind of damage should I look for?
  answer: Look for visible charring (brown/black marks) and a pitted, bubbled texture. The 1064 nm wavelength can ablate the
    resin matrix, exposing brittle glass fibers. This causes a significant loss of surface gloss and structural integrity.
- question: What are the specific health hazards of laser cleaning fiberglass compared to cleaning metal?
  answer: Unlike metal dust, laser cleaning fiberglass at 5 J/cm² creates toxic resin fumes and aerosolizes sharp sub-50μm
    glass fibers. These pose a severe inhalation risk, often requiring HEPA filtration beyond standard PPE.
- question: Why is fiberglass so problematic for laser cleaning compared to materials like rust or paint on steel?
  answer: Unlike steel, fiberglass's polymer resin strongly absorbs 1064 nm laser energy. This makes the substrate itself
    vulnerable at fluences above ~5 J/cm², not just surface contaminants. Precise parameter control is essential to avoid
    thermal damage to the composite material.
- question: Is there any scenario where laser treatment of fiberglass is acceptable, such as for very light surface mold release?
  answer: Even for ultra-thin mold release, the risk is extreme. The fluence required for contaminant removal, typically above
    5 J/cm², will almost certainly exceed the damage threshold of the sensitive polymer matrix, causing irreversible degradation
    to the underlying resin.
- question: How does the weave and resin type (e.g., epoxy vs. polyester) affect its reaction to a laser?
  answer: While epoxy and polyester resins degrade at different temperatures, both will be damaged by the ~5 J/cm² fluence
    required for cleaning. The weave pattern is irrelevant; the 1064 nm laser energy is absorbed by the resin matrix binding
    the glass fibers, compromising the composite's structural integrity regardless of its specific construction.
