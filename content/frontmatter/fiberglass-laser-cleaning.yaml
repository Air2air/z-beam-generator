caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the fiberglass surface shows contaminants like fine
    dust particles and oily residues embedded among the fibers. This buildup leads
    to surface degradation, with visible pitting and slight fiber fraying.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the fiberglass surface appears smooth and evenly
    restored to its original luster. No fiber damage or delamination shows, preserving
    the composite's integrity well, and it retains full strength for ongoing applications.

      compressiveStrength:
        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: The compressive strength of fiberglass is highly dependent
          on the specific resin system, fiber type (e.g., E-glass, S-glass), and fiber
          orientation. For a general-purpose E-glass fiber-reinforced polymer composite,
          authoritative materials databases (AZoM, MatWeb) consistently report compressive
          strength values in the range of 480-1600 MPa. The provided value of 1034
          MPa is a typical mid-range value for a unidirectional E-glass/epoxy composite,
          which is significantly lower than its tensile strength due to different
          failure mechanisms (fiber buckling/kinking under compression).

        research_basis: Fiberglass (glass fiber reinforced polymer) exhibits excellent
          resistance to most environmental corrosion including atmospheric exposure,
          water, and many chemicals due to the protective polymer matrix and inert
          glass fibers. It does not rust or corrode like metals, though it can experience
          some degradation from UV exposure and strong alkalis over very long periods.

          high for a bulk fiberglass composite, more typical of individual glass fibers.
          For a standard fiberglass-reinforced polymer (GRP/FRP), authoritative engineering
          databases (AZoM, MatWeb) list flexural strength values in the range of 200-800
          MPa. The cited value of 689 MPa is a representative high-end value for a
          unidirectional or high-fiber-volume E-glass/epoxy composite, which aligns
          with the expected relationship where flexural strength is significantly
          lower than the ultimate fiber tensile strength but higher than the matrix-dominated
          compressive strength.

        research_basis: Fiberglass is a composite material, and its maximum service
          temperature is dictated by the polymer matrix (typically epoxy or polyester),
          not the glass fibers. Authoritative materials databases (AZoM, MatWeb) consistently
          report the maximum continuous service temperature for standard fiberglass
          composites in air to be in the range of 140-350°C, with 340°C being a common
          upper limit for high-temperature epoxy systems before the resin begins to
          thermally degrade and oxidize.
