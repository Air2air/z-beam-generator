caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the birch wood surface exhibits severe contamination,
    marked by clustered dust particles and oily residues that infiltrate the porous
    grain structure. These contaminants, featuring jagged edges and sub-micron sizes,
    accelerate degradation through micro-pitting and fiber erosion, dulling the once-smooth
    texture. This compromised state challenges general cleaning applications in laser
    optics manufacturing, where residue-free surfaces maintain beam precision.
  afterText: The cleaned birch wood surface, post-restoration, exhibits a smooth,
    residue-free condition with restored natural grain. Restoration quality proves
    excellent, maintaining full material integrity without fiber disruption or discoloration.
    This method supports precise surface prep for laser optics in California photonics
    labs.

        research_basis: Birch is a non-durable hardwood with low natural resistance
          to decay fungi and insects. According to USDA wood durability classifications,
          birch falls into the "non-resistant" to "slightly resistant" category for
          decay resistance, with service life of less than 5 years in ground contact.
          While it has moderate resistance to chemical corrosion compared to metals,
          its organic composition makes it susceptible to biological degradation,
          moisture damage, and environmental weathering.

        research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
          reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Yellow Birch as 13,900 psi, which
          converts to approximately 97 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength
          measured via standard 3-point or 4-point bend tests. While birch species
          vary, this falls within the typical 70-120 MPa range cited in wood mechanics
          literature for quality birch lumber.
