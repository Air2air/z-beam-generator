    compressiveStrength:
      value: 46.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
        data for North American hardwoods. For yellow birch, it lists compressive
        strength (crushing strength) parallel to grain as 46.0 MPa at 12% moisture
        content, which is the standard test condition for wood mechanical properties
        according to ASTM D143. This value is consistent with published data from
        the USDA Forest Products Laboratory for birch species.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Birch is a non-durable hardwood with low natural resistance
        to decay fungi and insects. According to USDA wood durability classifications,
        birch falls into the "non-resistant" to "slightly resistant" category for
        decay resistance, with service life of less than 5 years in ground contact.
        While it has moderate resistance to chemical corrosion compared to metals,
        its organic composition makes it susceptible to biological degradation, moisture
        damage, and environmental weathering.

        Table 4-3: Specific gravity of some commercially important woods. Specifically
        cites Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis) at 12% moisture content.'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 97.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
        reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Yellow Birch as 13,900 psi, which
        converts to approximately 97 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength
        measured via standard 3-point or 4-point bend tests. While birch species vary,
        this falls within the typical 70-120 MPa range cited in wood mechanics literature
        for quality birch lumber.
    hardness:
      value: 1260.0
      min: 1
      max: 5000

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook states that prolonged exposure to temperatures
        above 200°C (392°F) leads to significant thermal degradation of wood, including
        the onset of pyrolysis and oxidative reactions that permanently reduce strength.
        While ignition temperature is higher (~250°C), 200°C is the established maximum
        for sustained service before significant chemical decomposition begins.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 2.1
      min: 0.33

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: This value for European Beech (a hardwood with similar density
        and mechanical properties to Birch) is derived from a controlled Mode I fracture
        toughness (K_IC) test. Birch, as a diffuse-porous hardwood, typically exhibits
        fracture toughness in the range of 1.5 to 3.5 MPa·√m, with 2.1 MPa·√m being
        a representative median value for clear, defect-free wood tested in the radial-longitudinal
        (RL) or tangential-longitudinal (TL) crack propagation systems at room temperature.
