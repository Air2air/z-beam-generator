        source: Portland Cement Association - "Stucco Resource Center" Technical Documents
        research_basis: Stucco (portland cement-based) exhibits excellent corrosion
          resistance due to its high alkalinity (pH ~12-13) which passivates embedded
          materials and resists chemical attack from atmospheric exposure. The cementitious
          matrix provides superior performance against environmental corrosion compared
          to other masonry materials, with documented long-term durability in various
          climates.

        research_basis: Stucco is primarily composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate
          (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O). Authoritative materials handbooks indicate that calcium
          sulfate-based materials begin significant decomposition (not oxidation in
          the metallic sense, but thermal degradation) in air starting around 1200°C,
          where it decomposes to calcium oxide and sulfur oxides. This temperature
          represents the maximum service limit before material failure.

          and Application Guide"
        research_basis: The PCA, a leading authority on cement-based materials, provides
          a typical flexural strength range for portland cement plaster (stucco) of
          2.8 to 3.5 MPa when tested in accordance with ASTM C78 (standard test method
          for flexural strength of concrete using a simple beam with third-point loading).
          The value of 3.0 MPa is a conservative, commonly cited average within this
          range for general design and specification purposes. This property is distinct
          from the provided compressive strength and is directly relevant for evaluating
          the material's resistance to bending.

        research_basis: The provided value is a conservative estimate based on stucco's
          classification as a cementitious, quasi-brittle masonry material. Its compressive
          strength (24.1 MPa) and low Mohs hardness (2.0) place it in a similar performance
          range to low-strength cement plasters and mortars, for which fracture toughness
          values are typically reported between 0.2 and 0.4 MPa·√m. The cited source
