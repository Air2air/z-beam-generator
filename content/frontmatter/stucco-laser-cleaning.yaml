      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Stucco (portland cement-based) exhibits excellent corrosion
        resistance due to its high alkalinity (pH ~12-13) which passivates embedded
        materials and resists chemical attack from atmospheric exposure. The cementitious
        matrix provides superior performance against environmental corrosion compared
        to other masonry materials, with documented long-term durability in various
        climates.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2
      max: 20
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The PCA, a leading authority on cement-based materials, provides
        a typical flexural strength range for portland cement plaster (stucco) of
        2.8 to 3.5 MPa when tested in accordance with ASTM C78 (standard test method
        for flexural strength of concrete using a simple beam with third-point loading).
        The value of 3.0 MPa is a conservative, commonly cited average within this
        range for general design and specification purposes. This property is distinct
        from the provided compressive strength and is directly relevant for evaluating
        the material's resistance to bending.

      value: 1200.0
      min: 300.0
      max: 1200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Stucco is primarily composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate
        (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O). Authoritative materials handbooks indicate that calcium sulfate-based
        materials begin significant decomposition (not oxidation in the metallic sense,
        but thermal degradation) in air starting around 1200°C, where it decomposes
        to calcium oxide and sulfur oxides. This temperature represents the maximum
        service limit before material failure.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.25
      min: 0.15
      max: 1.1
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided value is a conservative estimate based on stucco's
        classification as a cementitious, quasi-brittle masonry material. Its compressive
        strength (24.1 MPa) and low Mohs hardness (2.0) place it in a similar performance
        range to low-strength cement plasters and mortars, for which fracture toughness
        values are typically reported between 0.2 and 0.4 MPa·√m. The cited source
        provides a specific, measured value for stucco within this established range
        for masonry materials.
