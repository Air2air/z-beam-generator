  beforeText: Under microscopy, the stucco surface appears contaminated heavily-heavily
    with fine dust particles and organic films that adhere tightly and obscure pores
    completely. Contaminants show irregular shapes, dark-dark colors, and clumped
    clusters of silica and salts embedded deeply. Surface degradation is evident in
    cracked binders and eroded grains, so the material looks weakened and discolored
    step by step.
  afterText: The stucco surface appears very-very clean and smooth after laser cleaning,
    with fine details restored beautifully. Integrity remains intact, no cracks or
    damage seen, so material stays strong for cultural heritage use. Restoration quality
    is excellent, preserving original texture.
