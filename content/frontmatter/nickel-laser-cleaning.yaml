        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.9
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure nickel is highly dependent
          on its form (wrought, cast, powder) and temper/condition (annealed vs. cold-worked).
          For annealed, commercially pure (99.5%) wrought nickel, the compressive
          yield strength (0.2% offset) is typically in the range of 70-150 MPa. However,
          this value can increase significantly with cold working, reaching up to
          1000 MPa for severely cold-worked material. The provided value range reflects
          this wide variation based on material condition.

        research_basis: Nickel exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion in many
          environments, particularly in neutral and alkaline conditions, and against
          caustic alkalis. It maintains good resistance to atmospheric corrosion,
          fresh water, and seawater. However, it has poor resistance to oxidizing
          acids and sulfur-containing environments, which prevents a perfect 10 rating.

        research_basis: Nickel and nickel alloys typically exhibit fracture toughness
          values in the range of 100-150 MPa·√m at room temperature. Pure nickel generally
          falls in the lower end of this range (around 100 MPa·√m), while nickel alloys
          can extend to higher values. The variation depends on purity, grain size,
          and processing history, but 100-150 MPa·√m represents the well-established
          range for nickel materials in standard references.
