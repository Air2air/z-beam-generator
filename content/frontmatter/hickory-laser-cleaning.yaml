faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning contaminants from Hickory
    without burning or yellowing the surface?
  answer: For Hickory's high lignin content, use nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This minimizes
    thermal input, preventing scorching. Maintain average power below 100 W and a scan speed of 500 mm/s for effective contaminant
    removal without yellowing the wood surface.
- question: How do you remove smoke stains or soot from a Hickory surface using a laser without causing further damage?
  answer: For Hickory, use a defocused beam at 1.2 J/cm² and 500 mm/s scan speed. This gently ablates the superficial soot
    layer while minimizing heat transfer to the underlying wood, preventing further damage. The key is a high repetition rate
    with very low fluence to avoid cooking the compromised surface.
- question: Can a laser effectively clean old, oxidized finish or paint from Hickory while preserving the wood's natural color
    and grain?
  answer: This is a high-risk application on Hickory. The 1064 nm wavelength and 1.2 J/cm² fluence must ablate the finish
    without interacting with the wood's lignin, which is critical for preserving its natural color.
- question: Why does Hickory tend to turn dark or black when laser cleaned, unlike Maple or Pine?
  answer: Hickory's high density and lignin concentration make it prone to carbonization at energy densities above 1.2 J/cm².
    This differs from less dense woods like Pine, which contain fewer organic polymers that readily char under laser irradiation
    at 1064 nm.
- question: Is laser cleaning safe for restoring antique Hickory furniture or tools, or does it risk removing the patina?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² will inherently ablate the wood's top layer where patina resides. This subtractive process
    fundamentally alters the antique's character and is not recommended for valuable Hickory pieces where preserving the original
    surface is critical.
- question: What are the primary fume extraction and safety concerns when laser cleaning Hickory, especially if it has old
    finishes?
  answer: Laser cleaning Hickory at 1.2 J/cm² generates fine particulates and potentially toxic VOCs from old finishes. A
    Class I enclosure with HEPA and activated carbon filtration is non-negotiable to capture these hazardous byproducts, ensuring
    operator safety.
- question: How does the high density and Janka hardness of Hickory affect the laser cleaning process compared to softer woods?
  answer: Hickory's high density causes slower lateral heat diffusion, concentrating thermal energy at the beam's 100 µm spot.
    This demands precise tuning to our 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold to avoid charring, unlike more forgiving softwoods.
- question: Are there any surface pre-treatments or post-treatment steps recommended when laser cleaning Hickory to prevent
    discoloration?
  answer: For Hickory, post-treatment with a very light sanding effectively removes the superficial, heat-affected layer that
    can cause discoloration. During the process, using a low-power air assist helps cool the surface, mitigating thermal stress
    when operating near the 1.2 J/cm² fluence threshold. Pre-treatments are generally avoided to prevent surface contamination.
- question: For preparing Hickory for a new finish, is laser cleaning a viable alternative to sanding for removing mill scale
    or embedded dirt?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes surface contaminants from Hickory without altering its texture, using a 100W
    system at 500 mm/s. However, the heat-affected zone can inhibit stain absorption, risking an uneven finish. This method
    won't level the surface, so sanding remains necessary for deep stains or planar correction.
