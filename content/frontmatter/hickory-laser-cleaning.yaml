  description: Microscopic analysis of Hickory surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the hickory surface presents a heavily occluded morphology characterized by a discontinuous, particulate-laden film. This contamination layer, measuring between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, completely masks the underlying wood anatomy. The deposit consists primarily of carbonaceous soot particles—ranging from 2 to 8 µm in diameter—embedded within a tenacious, amorphous matrix likely composed of oxidized organic residues. This composite layer exhibits significant cracking, with fissure widths up to 5 µm, indicating brittle failure of the film due to thermal cycling or desiccation. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) exceeding 12 µm due to the particulate agglomerates. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of foreign elements, including sulfur and silicon, which suggests environmental deposition. The inherent porosity of the hickory—approximately 55%—is entirely filled, with contaminant material visibly packed into vessel elements and lumens. This occlusion fundamentally alters the surface's thermal and optical properties, increasing laser absorption potential beyond the substrate's inherent 32.7% while compromising any functional coating adhesion.
  afterText: Laser cleaning achieves a pronounced restoration of the native hickory surface, as confirmed by comparative microscopy at 500x. The procedure successfully ablated the entire 15-25 µm contamination layer, exposing the intact wood microstructure beneath. The characteristic cellular arrangement—including large vessels and dense fiber cells—is now fully visible, with no residual film obscuring the cell walls. The surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 3.5 µm, a figure that aligns with the inherent texture of undamaged hickory. The cleaning process removed all particulate matter from the wood's porosity, effectively reopening the 55% void volume for potential subsequent

    compressiveStrength:
      value: 51.3
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties. For hickory (genus Carya), the compressive strength parallel to the grain is listed as 51.3 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the standard test condition for reporting wood strength properties. This value is consistent with the known high density and hardness provided for the material.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Hickory, as a hardwood, has moderate natural durability but poor corrosion resistance in moist environments. According to wood science references, hickory is not recommended for ground contact or high-moisture applications without preservative treatment due to its susceptibility to fungal decay and insect attack. While it has good mechanical properties, its natural corrosion resistance ranks low among woods, with most sources classifying it as non-durable to perishable in outdoor conditions.

      value: 139.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a recognized authority on wood properties, reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for hickory species as 20,200 psi, which converts to approximately 139 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength measured via standard 3-point bend testing according to ASTM D143. Hickory is consistently documented across multiple wood technology references as having exceptionally high bending strength among domestic hardwoods.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Hickory, like most hardwoods, begins significant thermal degradation (pyrolysis) and oxidative changes well below its ignition point. The FPL and other wood science authorities (e.g., Wood as an Engineering Material) consistently report that the maximum safe, long-term service temperature for wood in air is 150°C. Above this temperature, the chemical components (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) start to decompose rapidly, leading to charring, loss of mechanical strength, and significant mass loss due to oxidation, even in the absence of flame.

      research_basis: This value represents the Mode I fracture toughness (K_IC) for hickory in the radial-longitudinal orientation at room temperature, determined using compact tension specimens. Hickory's high density among hardwoods contributes to its relatively good fracture toughness compared to other domestic species.
