  beforeText: Microscopy shows Hickory's surface marred by embedded dust particles,
    causing pitting and fiber erosion. This degrades cleaning in furniture production.
  afterText: After cleaning Hickory wood surfaces, the material exhibits a smooth,
    residue-free finish that restores its original grain and warm tones effectively.
    Restoration quality remains high, with no damage to structural integrity or natural
    oils. This method supports applications in furniture maintenance, ensuring long-lasting,
    vibrant results without surface degradation.

        research_basis: Hickory, as a hardwood, has moderate natural durability but
          poor corrosion resistance in moist environments. According to wood science
          references, hickory is not recommended for ground contact or high-moisture
          applications without preservative treatment due to its susceptibility to
          fungal decay and insect attack. While it has good mechanical properties,
          its natural corrosion resistance ranks low among woods, with most sources
          classifying it as non-durable to perishable in outdoor conditions.

        research_basis: Hickory, like most hardwoods, begins significant thermal degradation
          (pyrolysis) and oxidative changes well below its ignition point. The FPL
          and other wood science authorities (e.g., Wood as an Engineering Material)
          consistently report that the maximum safe, long-term service temperature
          for wood in air is 150°C. Above this temperature, the chemical components
          (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) start to decompose rapidly, leading to
          charring, loss of mechanical strength, and significant mass loss due to
          oxidation, even in the absence of flame.
