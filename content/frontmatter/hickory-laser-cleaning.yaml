        research_basis: Hickory, as a hardwood, has moderate natural durability but
          poor corrosion resistance in moist environments. According to wood science
          references, hickory is not recommended for ground contact or high-moisture
          applications without preservative treatment due to its susceptibility to
          fungal decay and insect attack. While it has good mechanical properties,
          its natural corrosion resistance ranks low among woods, with most sources
          classifying it as non-durable to perishable in outdoor conditions.

        research_basis: Hickory, like most hardwoods, begins significant thermal degradation
          (pyrolysis) and oxidative changes well below its ignition point. The FPL
          and other wood science authorities (e.g., Wood as an Engineering Material)
          consistently report that the maximum safe, long-term service temperature
          for wood in air is 150°C. Above this temperature, the chemical components
          (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) start to decompose rapidly, leading to
          charring, loss of mechanical strength, and significant mass loss due to
          oxidation, even in the absence of flame.

        research_basis: The Wood Database, a recognized authority on wood properties,
          reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for hickory species as 20,200 psi,
          which converts to approximately 139 MPa. This value represents the flexural
          strength measured via standard 3-point bend testing according to ASTM D143.
          Hickory is consistently documented across multiple wood technology references
          as having exceptionally high bending strength among domestic hardwoods.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties.
          For hickory (genus Carya), the compressive strength parallel to the grain
          is listed as 51.3 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the standard test
          condition for reporting wood strength properties. This value is consistent
          with the known high density and hardness provided for the material.
