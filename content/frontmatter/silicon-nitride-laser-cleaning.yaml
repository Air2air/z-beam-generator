caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Silicon Nitride surface shows contamination with
    fine particles and oily residues scattered across it. These contaminants, mainly
    dust and machining debris, lead to surface degradation like small pits and cracks.
    This roughens the ceramic and impacts its clean performance.
  afterText: The cleaned silicon nitride surface shows a smooth, even restoration
    after laser processing. It reveals high quality, with no cracks or degradation,
    preserving the ceramic's integrity and key properties like hardness and thermal
    stability.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of silicon nitride is significantly
          higher than its tensile or flexural strength, a characteristic of brittle
          ceramics. While flexural strength is typically in the range of 600-1200
          MPa, authoritative materials handbooks and manufacturer data (e.g., from
          Kyocera, CeramTec) consistently report compressive strength values between
          3000-4000 MPa for dense, high-purity sintered silicon nitride. The value
          of 3500 MPa represents a well-established, conservative average for high-quality
          structural grades under standard room-temperature testing conditions.

          its strong covalent bonds and stable silicon oxide surface layer that forms
          in air/water. It maintains structural integrity in harsh chemical environments
          where metals typically fail, though it can be attacked by strong bases at
          elevated temperatures and molten salts.

          sintered silicon nitride used in engineering applications, typical 3-point
          and 4-point bend test values range from 600 MPa to 1000 MPa. The value of

        research_basis: Silicon nitride exhibits excellent oxidation resistance up
          to approximately 1200°C in air due to the formation of a protective silicon
          dioxide (SiO₂) layer. Above this temperature, the protective layer can degrade,
          and significant oxidation begins, leading to material recession and strength
          degradation. This 1200°C threshold is consistently cited across multiple
          ceramic engineering references as the maximum continuous service temperature
          in oxidizing environments.

          can vary slightly (typically 5.0-7.0 MPa·√m) depending on specific microstructure
          and processing route.
