  description: Microscopic analysis of Silicon Nitride surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Silicon Nitride surface shows contamination with
    fine particles and oily residues scattered across it. These contaminants, mainly
    dust and machining debris, lead to surface degradation like small pits and cracks.
    This roughens the ceramic and impacts its clean performance.
  afterText: The cleaned silicon nitride surface shows a smooth, even restoration
    after laser processing. It reveals high quality, with no cracks or degradation,
    preserving the ceramic's integrity and key properties like hardness and thermal
    stability.
