    compressiveStrength:
      value: 3500.0
      min: 100
      max: 7000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of silicon nitride is significantly
        higher than its tensile or flexural strength, a characteristic of brittle
        ceramics. While flexural strength is typically in the range of 600-1200 MPa,
        authoritative materials handbooks and manufacturer data (e.g., from Kyocera,
        CeramTec) consistently report compressive strength values between 3000-4000
        MPa for dense, high-purity sintered silicon nitride. The value of 3500 MPa
        represents a well-established, conservative average for high-quality structural
        grades under standard room-temperature testing conditions.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 8
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Silicon nitride exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to most
        acids (except hydrofluoric acid), alkalis, and molten metals due to its strong
        covalent bonds and stable silicon oxide surface layer that forms in air/water.
        It maintains structural integrity in harsh chemical environments where metals
        typically fail, though it can be attacked by strong bases at elevated temperatures
        and molten salts.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 800.0
      min: 50
      max: 2500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of silicon nitride is highly dependent
        on its manufacturing process and microstructure. For commercially available,
        sintered silicon nitride used in engineering applications, typical 3-point
        and 4-point bend test values range from 600 MPa to 1000 MPa. The value of
        800 MPa is a well-established, representative average for high-grade, dense
        reaction-bonded or sintered silicon nitride, as confirmed by materials handbooks
        and engineering databases.

      value: 1200.0
      min: 600.0
      max: 2400.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Silicon nitride exhibits excellent oxidation resistance up to
        approximately 1200°C in air due to the formation of a protective silicon dioxide
        (SiO₂) layer. Above this temperature, the protective layer can degrade, and
        significant oxidation begins, leading to material recession and strength degradation.
        This 1200°C threshold is consistently cited across multiple ceramic engineering
        references as the maximum continuous service temperature in oxidizing environments.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Silicon Nitride is a high-performance ceramic known for its
        good fracture toughness relative to other ceramics. The reported value of
        6.0 MPa·√m is a well-established median for dense, high-quality sintered or
        hot-pressed silicon nitride at room temperature, as documented in authoritative
        materials handbooks and review articles on structural ceramics. This value
        can vary slightly (typically 5.0-7.0 MPa·√m) depending on specific microstructure
        and processing route.
