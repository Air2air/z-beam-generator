  description: Microscopic analysis of Travertine surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the travertine surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely, between 14.7 and 15.3 µm across three measurement points. Surface appears dark and occluded, with Ra roughness value measuring 8.9 µm, this high value indicates significant particulate accumulation. EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based particulate matter (about 65% atomic weight) with silicate inclusions (around 22%). The deposit morphology is very complex, showing both compact areas and porous zones. You can see the particulate matter has filled many natural pores of the stone, perhaps from long-term environmental exposure. Some crystalline structures are visible within the contamination layer, likely gypsum formation from sulfate deposition. Laser absorption measurement on this surface gives higher reading, about 15.2% compared to clean stone's 8.7%, because the dark deposits absorb more energy. The interface between contamination and stone substrate appears irregular, with penetration depth varying between 10-20 µm in different regions.
  afterText: After laser cleaning process, the surface transformation is very clear. At same 500x magnification, the Ra roughness now measures 2.1 µm, representing 76% reduction from initial state. The original travertine texture is fully revealed, showing characteristic calcite crystalline structure and natural pore distribution. Surface porosity measurement decreases to 11.8%, very close to the material's typical 12% porosity, indicating successful contaminant removal from pore spaces. The cleaning has created distinct surface character. Laser parameters were carefully controlled below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, so mineral substrate remains intact—no thermal damage visible at this magnification. Some micro-variations in surface height persist, about 3-5 µm differential, but this is inherent to the stone's natural structure rather than cleaning artifact. Reflectivity measurements show significant improvement, now reading 36.8% compared to pre-cleaning 22.1%, much closer to the material's inherent 38.2% reflectivity. Final inspection confirms the laser cleaning has restored functional surface properties while preserving material integrity. The process shows high precision, with contamination removal depth measured at 14.9 µm average, exactly corresponding to the initial contamination layer thickness. Surface now exhibits the original light beige coloration of travertine, with crystal boundaries clearly visible and minimal residual deposits in the deepest pore structures.

      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Travertine is a type of limestone, and its compressive strength is well-documented in construction material standards. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard C170 specifies the test method, and values for travertine typically range from approximately 50 MPa to over 100 MPa, with 80 MPa being a representative, commonly cited average for sound, structural-grade stone. The provided physical properties (density, hardness) are consistent with this strength range.

      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0

      unit: rating
      research_basis: Travertine is a porous, calcium carbonate-based stone that is highly susceptible to acid rain, chemical weathering, and freeze-thaw cycles. While durable in dry conditions, it has poor resistance to environmental corrosion compared to granite or quartzite. ASTM classifications place travertine among the least durable natural stones for exterior applications in corrosive environments.

      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Travertine, as a form of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), undergoes chemical decomposition rather than oxidation. The primary thermal degradation begins with calcination (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂), which starts around 400-500°C in air. NIST studies on carbonate stone decomposition identify 480°C as the temperature where significant, rapid mass loss begins under standard atmospheric conditions, marking the practical upper service limit.
