caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Travertine surface appears heavily contaminated
    with fine particulate matter and oily residues, forming uneven layers across its
    porous texture. This surface, it reveals clustered deposits of siliceous dust
    and organic pollutants that embed into the calcite grains, causing pitting, discoloration,
    and gradual erosion. Such degradation weakens the stone's integrity for architecture
    and cultural heritage uses.
  afterText: The cleaned travertine surface now appears smooth and uniform, free from
    dirt and discoloration. This restoration demonstrates high quality, preserving
    the stone's natural porosity and color. Material integrity remains intact, with
    no cracks or thermal damage, ideal for cultural heritage and architectural use.
