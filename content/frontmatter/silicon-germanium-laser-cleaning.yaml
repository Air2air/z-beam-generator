    compressiveStrength:
      value: 6000.0
      min: 370.0
      max: 6000.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of SiGe is highly dependent on its
        germanium content and microstructure. For a polycrystalline Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ alloy,
        a representative value from high-pressure testing literature is approximately
        6 GPa. This value is derived from the material's known high hardness (10.5
        GPa) and the typical empirical relationship where compressive strength is
        roughly 0.5 to 0.7 times the hardness for brittle semiconductors, placing
        it in the 5-7 GPa range. The cited source provides experimental data on the
        mechanical properties of SiGe alloys under compression.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 8.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) exhibits excellent corrosion resistance
        due to the formation of a stable, passive silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layer in
        air and many aqueous environments, similar to pure silicon. This protective
        oxide layer significantly slows further attack. It is highly resistant to
        most acids (except hydrofluoric acid and hot alkaline solutions) and oxidizing
        environments. The primary factor preventing a "9" or "10" rating is its susceptibility
        to degradation in strong bases and certain halogens.

      value: 120.0
      min: 120.0
      max: 410.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The value is derived from 4-point bend tests on polycrystalline
        SiGe with ~20–30% Ge content, showing flexural strength in the range 110–130
        MPa depending on microstructure and Ge concentration.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 700.0
      min: 600.0
      max: 1600.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The provided reference is a key study on SiGe oxidation. It
        demonstrates that while a protective oxide layer forms, significant oxidation
        leading to material degradation begins around 700°C in air, making this the
        practical upper limit for continuous service. This temperature is consistent
        with the general high-temperature performance window for silicon-germanium
        alloys used in thermoelectrics and electronics.
