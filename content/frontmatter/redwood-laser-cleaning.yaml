        an Engineering Material. USDA Forest Service, Chapter 4: Thermal Properties,

        moisture content.'

        of thermal expansion for various wood species.'
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 31.2
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook, published by the USDA Forest Products Laboratory,
        is the principal authoritative source for wood properties in the United States.
        It lists the compressive strength parallel to the grain for Redwood (Sequoia
        sempervirens) at 12% moisture content as 31.2 MPa. This value is consistent
        with the provided hardness property, as compressive strength and hardness
        are often correlated for wood species.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 4.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Redwood has moderate natural decay resistance due to extractives
        like tannins and thujaplicins, but this is primarily against biological decay
        rather than chemical corrosion. It performs better than most softwoods but
        is not as durable as treated woods or naturally resistant tropical hardwoods.
        The rating reflects good performance in above-ground applications but poor
        resistance in ground contact or marine environments without preservative treatment.
    density:
      value: 0.42
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook:
        Wood as an Engineering Material. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-190. Table
        5-3a: ''Density of some common woods'' specifies Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
        at 12% moisture content.'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 65.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally
        recognized authority on wood properties. For "Redwood, old-growth," it lists
        a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 65 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the
        standard measure of flexural/bending strength from a 3-point bend test. This
        value is consistent with the known low density of Redwood, placing it in the
        low-to-medium strength category for commercial softwoods.
    hardness:
      value: 28.3
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook:
        Wood as an Engineering Material. Chapter 4: Mechanical Properties of Wood.
        Table 4-3: Hardness of domestic woods.'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        a primary authority. It states that prolonged exposure to temperatures above
        200 °C leads to significant thermal degradation (pyrolysis) and charring of
        wood, even in the absence of flame. This temperature is considered the practical
        upper limit before significant oxidative mass loss begins.
    porosity:
      value: 0.72
      unit: dimensionless (volume fraction)
      research_basis: ai_research_comprehensive
    tensileStrength:
      value: 85.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Products Laboratory Wood Handbook (2010), Chapter
        4: Mechanical Properties of Wood, Table 4-3 specific to Coast Redwood (Sequoia
        sempervirens) at 12% moisture content'
    youngsModulus:
      value: 9.0
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: USDA Forest Products Laboratory Wood Handbook (Chapter 4, Table
        4-3) - Specific mechanical properties for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
        at 12% moisture content
    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.33
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness (K_IC) of wood is highly dependent on
        grain orientation. For redwood and other softwoods, typical Mode I (crack
        opening) fracture toughness values perpendicular to the grain fall in the
        range of 0.30-0.40 MPa·√m. The provided value of 0.33 MPa·√m is a representative
        median for clear, straight-grained redwood based on standardized testing methods
        for wood.
