caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, redwood's surface shows heavy-heavy contamination
    by dirt particles and organic residues. These cling tightly, degrading wood with
    pitting and discoloration. Surface appears rough-rough and damaged.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the redwood surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean, with dirt removed then contaminants eliminated thoroughly. The
    process restores natural grain patterns beautifully, so the wood looks renewed
    and vibrant. Material integrity remains intact, no burns or cracks appear, and
    strength stays preserved for long-lasting applications.

          is the principal authoritative source for wood properties in the United
          States. It lists the compressive strength parallel to the grain for Redwood
          (Sequoia sempervirens) at 12% moisture content as 31.2 MPa. This value is
          consistent with the provided hardness property, as compressive strength
          and hardness are often correlated for wood species.

        research_basis: Redwood has moderate natural decay resistance due to extractives
          like tannins and thujaplicins, but this is primarily against biological
          decay rather than chemical corrosion. It performs better than most softwoods
          but is not as durable as treated woods or naturally resistant tropical hardwoods.
          The rating reflects good performance in above-ground applications but poor
          resistance in ground contact or marine environments without preservative
          treatment.

          a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 65 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the
          standard measure of flexural/bending strength from a 3-point bend test.
          This value is consistent with the known low density of Redwood, placing
          it in the low-to-medium strength category for commercial softwoods.
