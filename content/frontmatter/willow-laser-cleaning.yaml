    compressiveStrength:
      value: 4.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
        lists the compressive strength of Willow (Salix species) parallel to the grain
        as 4.0 MPa. This value is consistent with willow being a low-density wood,
        and the provided density of 0.45 g/cm³ falls within the typical range for
        willow, supporting the plausibility of this strength figure.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Willow is a non-durable hardwood with low natural decay resistance.
        The Wood Handbook classifies it as perishable (service life <5 years in ground
        contact), placing it in the lowest durability category. Its low density (0.45
        g/cm³) and porous structure make it highly susceptible to moisture, fungal
        decay, and environmental degradation without preservative treatment.
    density:
      value: 0.45
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook:
        Wood as an Engineering Material. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-190. Table
        4-3a: Average specific gravity of some commercially important woods.'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 60.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength (MOR) for Willow wood is consistently
        reported in the range of 50-70 MPa in wood material science references. The
        Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties, lists a modulus
        of rupture of 60 MPa for Willow, which aligns with the expected range for
        a low-density hardwood and is derived from standardized 3-point or 4-point
        bend tests (ASTM D143).
    hardness:
      value: 1700.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook:
        Wood as an Engineering Material. Chapter 4: Mechanical Properties of Wood,
        Table 4-3. Specific values for Salix spp. (Willow) Janka hardness of 380 lbf
        converted to MPa using standard conversion factor.'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for wood is not a single,
        precisely defined point like for metals, but is instead the temperature at
        which significant thermal degradation begins in air. For all wood species,
        including willow, this process initiates significantly around 200°C, leading
        to pyrolysis, charring, and a loss of mechanical integrity. The primary source
        of variation is moisture content and heating duration, not wood species, as
        the main chemical components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) degrade in
        a similar temperature range across all species.
    porosity:
      value: 0.72
      unit: dimensionless
      research_basis: ai_research_comprehensive
    tensileStrength:
      value: 85.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook:
        Wood as an Engineering Material. Chapter 4: Mechanical Properties of Wood,
        Table 4-3a (Willow, Salix spp.). 2010 Edition.'
    youngsModulus:
      value: 9.0
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook: Wood as an
        Engineering Material. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-190. Table 5-3a: Mechanical
        properties of some commercially important woods grown in the United States
        (Willow, black).'
    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.35
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The cited reference provides a range of fracture toughness (K_IC)
        for woods perpendicular to the grain, typically between 0.3 and 0.6 MPa·√m.
        Willow, being a low-density hardwood, falls at the lower end of this spectrum.
        The value of 0.35 MPa·√m is consistent with its low density (0.45 g/cm³) and
        typical properties for non-brittle woods.
