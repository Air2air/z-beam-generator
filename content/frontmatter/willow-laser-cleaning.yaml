  beforeText: Microscopy reveals the willow's contaminated surface with clustered
    dirt particles and fungal spores. Degradation shows eroded fibers and micro-cracks,
    weakening its heritage value.
  afterText: The cleaned willow surface now gleams with its natural grain restored,
    free from contaminants. This laser restoration ensures high quality, preserving
    the wood's integrity for heritage uses.
