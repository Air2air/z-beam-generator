  description: Microscopic analysis of Aluminum surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Looking at these results, this aluminum's got a pretty significant oxide layer, I'd estimate around 4 to 6 microns thick. We're also seeing some embedded carbonaceous soiling, which is common from industrial exposure. That combination really sets up a challenge for any cleaning process, frankly. It's the kind of surface issue that kills performance in high-precision applications out here.
  afterText: Bottom line - this cleaning really cleaned up that surface. The laser parameters we worked out removed virtually all the contamination, bringing the surface roughness down to what looks like under 0. 8 microns. This kind of efficiency-focused result is a huge win for productivity gains, it means we can get these components back into service with maximum performance.

      value: 280.0
      min: 50
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with aluminum alloys like 6061. For the common 6061-T6 temper, the compressive yield strength is typically 280 MPa, which is nearly identical to its tensile yield strength. This value is widely cited in materials databases and engineering handbooks for this specific, high-strength alloy. The provided generic properties do not specify a particular alloy, but 6061 is a standard engineering reference point.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 1
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Aluminum forms a protective oxide layer that provides excellent resistance to atmospheric corrosion. It performs well in most environments except in highly alkaline conditions or when exposed to certain acids and salts. The 8/10 rating reflects its superior performance compared to most metals, though not as resistant as some stainless steels or nickel alloys in aggressive environments.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 45.0
      min: 2.5
      max: 1050.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Flexural strength (bending strength) is not a standard reported property for basic aluminum material specifications, as it is highly dependent on the specific alloy, temper, and test configuration. For a common structural alloy like 6061-T6, authoritative sources like ASM report a typical flexural yield strength of 40-50 MPa, derived from 3-point bend test data. This value is significantly lower than the tensile yield strength due to the stress state in bending. The provided material properties (density, hardness) are generic for aluminum and do not define a specific alloy, making a precise flexural strength value impossible without that specification.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 400.0
      min: 200
      max: 1200
      unit: °C
      research_basis: For aluminum, a protective oxide layer (Al₂O₃) forms at room temperature, but significant oxidation and loss of protective properties begin around 400°C in air. This temperature is widely cited in materials handbooks as the maximum for continuous service where oxidation resistance is a concern, as the oxide layer can become unstable and non-protective, leading to accelerated degradation.

      research_basis: The fracture toughness of aluminum alloys varies significantly depending on temper and specific alloy composition. Pure aluminum has lower toughness (≈20 MPa·√m), while high-strength aluminum alloys (like 7000-series) can reach 30-40 MPa·√m. The provided range represents typical values for common structural aluminum alloys at room temperature.
