- description: Contaminant Removal Efficiency quantifies the mass of surface contaminants
    removed from the aluminum substrate, measured via mass spectrometry to detect
    trace elements and before/after microscopy to account for the soft substrate's
    susceptibility to plastic deformation and masking of true material loss. The metric
    is highly dependent on the adhesion strength of the specific contaminant to the
    native aluminum oxide layer and the surface geometry, which influences laser fluence
    distribution and shadowing effects.

faq:
  questions:
  - question: How can I safely remove oxidation from Aluminum surfaces in construction
      applications without causing damage?
    answer: Laser cleaning, employing a precise and systematic methodology, effectively
      ablates the oxide layer on aluminum, preserving the substrate's integrity and
      natural patina. Unlike abrasive methods, it avoids pitting or scratching, maintaining
      structural aesthetics with minimal heat input for densities around 2.7 g/cm³.
  - question: What are the best practices for maintaining Aluminum window frames to
      prevent coating buildup?
    answer: Conduct systematic inspections for oxidation and employ non-destructive
      laser cleaning to gently remove contaminants. This precisely preserves the 25
      μm anodized layer, enhances corrosion resistance, and extends longevity in weather-exposed
      environments without harsh chemicals.
  - question: How does laser cleaning benefit Aluminum restoration in heritage sculptures
      compared to traditional methods?
    answer: Laser ablation offers a precise, systematic approach to removing dirt
      and coatings from aluminum artifacts, without substrate damage or chemical residues—ideal
      for delicate historical pieces. It outperforms sandblasting via rigorous depth
      control, preserving the 60% IACS conductivity and formability.
  - question: What are common concerns when using laser cleaning on Aluminum alloys
      like 7000 series?
    answer: Key concerns involve heat-affected zones, but a systematic methodology
      with pulsed lasers precisely minimizes thermal input, preventing weakening of
      tensile strengths up to 700 MPa. It's safer than mechanical methods, reducing
      galvanic corrosion risks in alloyed aluminum contacts.
  - question: How do I remove rust-like stains from Aluminum without damaging its
      protective oxide layer?
    answer: Opt for laser cleaning, a systematic methodology that precisely vaporizes
      surface contaminants on aluminum while leaving the natural oxide film intact
      up to 25 μm thick. This non-contact approach avoids abrasion, preserving corrosion
      resistance in chloride-rich settings better than acids.
  - question: Why is Aluminum susceptible to galvanic corrosion, and can laser cleaning
      help maintain it?
    answer: Aluminum corrodes galvanically with dissimilar metals due to its 2.7 g/cm³
      density and oxide porosity; laser cleaning rigorously removes pitting without
      further exposure, precisely restoring conductivity at 60% IACS and preventing
      dirt entrapment for prolonged service life.
  - question: What advantages does laser cleaning offer over chemical stripping for
      Aluminum in aerospace components?
    answer: Laser cleaning offers a systematic, eco-friendly approach for precisely
      removing oxidation from aluminum, without residues or dimensional changes—essential
      for high-strength alloys. It reduces energy use while maintaining fatigue resistance,
      outperforming chemicals that can etch the lightweight substrate.
