- benefit: Chemical Waste Elimination
  applicableIndustries:
  - Semiconductor
  - Electronics
  - Medical
  - Nuclear
  description: Laser ablation removes surface contaminants from steel through sublimation,
    eliminating chemical solvents and acidic solutions used in traditional cleaning,
    thereby preventing hazardous waste streams containing heavy metals and toxic residues.
  quantifiedBenefits: Chemical waste elimination in steel laser cleaning reduces disposal
    costs by 30% and cuts environmental impact by 100% by completely eliminating hazardous
    consumables.
- benefit: Water Usage Reduction
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Laser cleaning eliminates the need for abrasive water blasting and
    chemical rinsing, directly conserving process water. Its precise, non-contact
    ablation removes contaminants without generating secondary wastewater streams
    or requiring post-process water treatment.
- benefit: Energy Efficiency
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Laser cleaning's localized energy application minimizes thermal input
    into the steel substrate, an advantage given its high thermal conductivity (52.0
    W/(m·K)), which would otherwise rapidly dissipate heat. This targeted approach
    significantly reduces total energy consumption compared to bulk heating methods.
- benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  applicableIndustries: []
  description: Laser ablation removes surface contaminants without generating hazardous
    airborne fumes or fine particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) associated with abrasive
    blasting media. This non-contact process eliminates secondary waste streams from
    consumables, preventing the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy
    metal dust.

outcomeMetrics:
- metric: Contaminant Removal Efficiency
  description: Contaminant Removal Efficiency quantifies the mass reduction of surface
    oxides or mill scale, measured via before/after mass spectrometry, relative to
    the initial contaminant mass on the steel substrate. The metric must account for
    the material's inherent Brinell hardness and initial surface roughness, as these
    properties influence the ablation threshold and the potential for base metal removal.
  measurementMethods:
  - Before/after microscopy
  - Chemical analysis
  - Mass spectrometry
  factorsAffecting:
  - Contamination type
  - Adhesion strength
  - Surface geometry
  units: []
  typicalRanges: 95-99.9% depending on application and material
- metric: Processing Speed
  description: Processing Speed quantifies the area of mild steel (120 HB) cleaned
    per unit time, measured in cm²/min, and is directly determined by laser parameters
    such as power, scan speed, and pulse frequency. The initial surface roughness
    (0.8 μm Ra) of the rolled steel establishes a baseline for defining the required
    cleaning threshold and verifying process completion.
  measurementMethods: []
  factorsAffecting: []
  units:
  - m²/h
  - cm²/min
  - mm²/s
- metric: Surface Quality Preservation
  description: Surface Quality Preservation quantifies the change in surface roughness
    (μm Ra) of the base steel material, ensuring minimal deviation from the initial
    state while preventing surface hardening or ablation-induced pitting. It is assessed
    by comparing pre- and post-cleaning profilometer measurements, with optimal laser
    parameters calibrated to maintain the substrate's original hardness and topography.

  factorsAffecting: []
  units: []
- metric: Thermal Damage Avoidance
  description: Thermal Damage Avoidance quantifies the preservation of the base metal's
    original microstructure and mechanical properties, specifically ensuring the post-cleaning
    Brinell hardness remains at approximately 120 HB and the underlying surface integrity
    is maintained without annealing or phase transformation. This is directly measured
    by comparing pre- and post-process hardness and metallographic analysis to confirm
    the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is negligible.
