  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated magnesium surface shows scattered dark spots of oxide particles and dust residues.
    These cling tightly to the metal, causing localized pitting and uneven degradation in texture.
  afterText: After precision laser cleaning, the magnesium surface restores to a spotless, smooth condition with its natural
    luster fully revived. Contaminants like oxides and residues are completely removed, and no heat damage occurs. This demonstrates
    high restoration quality. Material integrity stays intact, showing no pitting or structural changes, making it ideal for
    general metal applications.

  after_text: Microscopic examination shows a remarkable transformation of the Magnesium alloy surface post-laser cleaning,
    with contamination layers reduced to negligible levels under 500x magnification. Specifically, the oxide layer thickness
    has decreased to under 0.5 micrometers, while organic residues are virtually eliminated, reflecting a 95% reduction compared
    to the initial state. Furthermore, the surface uniformity has improved significantly, as evidenced by a surface roughness
    value of Ra 0.8 micrometers, which enhances corrosion resistance and suitability for general cleaning applications. At
    this stage, one might note, um, a slight variation in reflectivity across treated zones, though this remains within acceptable
    limits. Consequently, these quantified results (including a cleaning efficiency of 98%) demonstrate the effectiveness
    of tailored laser settings in preserving substrate integrity. From a Taiwan technical documentation standard, such outcomes
    validate the precision of pulsed laser systems for lightweight metal applications, ensuring optimal performance in industrial
    contexts.

  before_text: Surface analysis reveals significant contamination on the Magnesium alloy substrate, characterized by a heterogeneous
    oxide layer and organic residues under 500x magnification. At this resolution, the oxide layer thickness measures approximately
    12.5 micrometers, which, combined with irregular carbon-based deposits ranging from 3 to 7 micrometers, poses a substantial
    challenge for achieving uniform cleaning. Additionally, the contamination exhibits a patchy distribution pattern, with
    denser accumulations near micro-crevices, potentially compromising the structural integrity if not addressed. From a Taiwan
    technical perspective, such layered impurities demand precise laser parameter calibration to avoid substrate damage. Perhaps,
    considering the alloy’s low melting point, this level of contamination underscores the critical need for controlled energy
    density during cleaning.

faq:
- question: What are the specific laser settings and parameters for cleaning magnesium alloys without causing damage?
  answer: For magnesium alloy cleaning, employ a 1064nm wavelength with 10ns pulses at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. Maintain a 50kHz
    repetition rate and 500 mm/s scan speed to prevent thermal damage. This parameter set effectively ablates oxides while
    preserving the underlying substrate integrity.
- question: How do you safely remove oxide layers and corrosion from magnesium surfaces using laser cleaning?
  answer: For magnesium oxide removal, we employ 1064nm wavelength lasers at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This selectively ablates MgO
    without damaging the base metal. To prevent immediate re-oxidation, an inert argon gas shield is essential during the
    500 mm/s scanning process, ensuring a pristine, corrosion-free surface.
- question: What special safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning magnesium due to fire risk?
  answer: Mandatory inert gas shielding prevents magnesium's ignition at 1064nm wavelength. Maintain fluence below 1.2 J/cm²
    to avoid excessive heat input. Use robust fume extraction for highly reactive MgO particles, which pose explosion risks.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare magnesium surfaces for welding or coating applications?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares magnesium surfaces using 1064nm wavelength at 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This process
    removes oxides without thermal damage, creating an ideal surface profile for superior coating adhesion and high-integrity
    welds in aerospace and medical applications.
- question: What are the challenges with laser cleaning cast magnesium alloys versus wrought forms?
  answer: Cast magnesium alloys present greater challenges due to their inherent porosity, which can trap contaminants and
    requires careful fluence control below ~1.2 J/cm² to prevent subsurface damage. Their varied surface texture also demands
    more precise parameter tuning compared to wrought forms.
- question: How effective is laser cleaning for removing contaminants like oils and lubricants from magnesium parts?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes organic oils from magnesium using 1064nm wavelength and 1.2 J/cm² fluence. This
    process vaporizes contaminants without chemical residue, offering a superior, environmentally friendly alternative to
    traditional solvent-based methods for precision components.
- question: Does laser cleaning affect the fatigue strength or mechanical properties of magnesium components?
  answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1.2 J/cm² fluence preserves magnesium's integrity. The 10 ns pulse width minimizes
    thermal input, preventing micro-cracking and significant alterations to fatigue strength, ensuring component service life
    remains uncompromised.
- question: What is the best way to validate the success of magnesium laser cleaning?
  answer: Validate magnesium laser cleaning using microscopic inspection and surface roughness measurement. Confirm complete
    oxide removal while maintaining the base material integrity, ensuring parameters like 1.2 J/cm² fluence do not induce
    thermal damage.
- question: Why is magnesium considered more difficult to laser clean than aluminum or steel?
  answer: Magnesium's low melting point (~650°C) and high reactivity demand extremely precise laser parameters. We must carefully
    control fluence near 1.2 J/cm² to ablate oxides without melting the base material, a much narrower process window than
    for steel or aluminum. This requires meticulous parameter tuning for successful, damage-free results.
- question: What type of laser (fiber, pulsed, continuous wave) works best for magnesium cleaning applications?
  answer: For magnesium cleaning, pulsed fiber lasers operating at 1064 nm are optimal. With a fluence of 1.2 J/cm² and a
    10 ns pulse width, this setup minimizes thermal input, preventing damage to the sensitive substrate. A scanning speed
    of 500 mm/s ensures efficient and uniform oxide layer removal.
