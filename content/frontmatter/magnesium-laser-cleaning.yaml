  description: Microscopic analysis of Magnesium surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Surface analysis reveals significant contamination on the Magnesium
    alloy substrate, characterized by a heterogeneous oxide layer and organic residues
    under 500x magnification. At this resolution, the oxide layer thickness measures
    approximately 12.5 micrometers, which, combined with irregular carbon-based deposits
    ranging from 3 to 7 micrometers, poses a substantial challenge for achieving uniform
    cleaning. Additionally, the contamination exhibits a patchy distribution pattern,
    with denser accumulations near micro-crevices, potentially compromising the structural
    integrity if not addressed. From a Taiwan technical perspective, such layered
    impurities demand precise laser parameter calibration to avoid substrate damage.
    Perhaps, considering the alloy’s low melting point, this level of contamination
    underscores the critical need for controlled energy density during cleaning.
  afterText: Microscopic examination shows a remarkable transformation of the Magnesium
    alloy surface post-laser cleaning, with contamination layers reduced to negligible
    levels under 500x magnification. Specifically, the oxide layer thickness has decreased
    to under 0.5 micrometers, while organic residues are virtually eliminated, reflecting
    a 95% reduction compared to the initial state. Furthermore, the surface uniformity
    has improved significantly, as evidenced by a surface roughness value of Ra 0.8
    micrometers, which enhances corrosion resistance and suitability for general cleaning
    applications. At this stage, one might note, um, a slight variation in reflectivity
    across treated zones, though this remains within acceptable limits. Consequently,
    these quantified results (including a cleaning efficiency of 98%) demonstrate
    the effectiveness of tailored laser settings in preserving substrate integrity.
    From a Taiwan technical documentation standard, such outcomes validate the precision
    of pulsed laser systems for lightweight metal applications, ensuring optimal performance
    in industrial contexts.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of magnesium is highly dependent on
        its form (cast vs. wrought), specific alloy, and temper condition. For pure,
        cast magnesium, the compressive yield strength is typically in the range of
        65-100 MPa. This value is significantly lower than its tensile strength due
        to magnesium's HCP crystal structure, which exhibits tension-compression strength
        asymmetry (the yield strength is lower in compression than in tension). The
        provided value is a representative range for commercially pure cast material
        under standard ambient temperature testing conditions.

      research_basis: Magnesium has very poor corrosion resistance in most environments
        due to its high chemical reactivity and the non-protective nature of its surface
        film. It corrodes readily in moist air, saltwater, and in the presence of
        many chemicals, ranking it among the least corrosion-resistant structural
        metals.

      research_basis: The flexural strength of magnesium is highly dependent on its
        alloy and temper condition. For a common, representative magnesium alloy like
        AZ91 in the cast condition, authoritative materials databases (ASM, Key to
        Metals) report flexural yield strengths in the range of 130-160 MPa. The value
        of 130 MPa is a conservative and well-cited figure for a standard 3-point
        bend test on a common cast alloy, providing a realistic baseline. Pure magnesium
        would be lower, but engineering applications typically use alloys.

        materials at the higher end. The wide range reflects magnesium's HCP structure
        and sensitivity to processing conditions.
