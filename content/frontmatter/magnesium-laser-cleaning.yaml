  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated magnesium surface shows scattered dark
    spots of oxide particles and dust residues. These cling tightly to the metal,
    causing localized pitting and uneven degradation in texture.
  afterText: After precision laser cleaning, the magnesium surface restores to a spotless,
    smooth condition with its natural luster fully revived. Contaminants like oxides
    and residues are completely removed, and no heat damage occurs. This demonstrates
    high restoration quality. Material integrity stays intact, showing no pitting
    or structural changes, making it ideal for general metal applications.

        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: The compressive strength of magnesium is highly dependent
          on its form (cast vs. wrought), specific alloy, and temper condition. For
          pure, cast magnesium, the compressive yield strength is typically in the
          range of 65-100 MPa. This value is significantly lower than its tensile
          strength due to magnesium's HCP crystal structure, which exhibits tension-compression
          strength asymmetry (the yield strength is lower in compression than in tension).
          The provided value is a representative range for commercially pure cast
          material under standard ambient temperature testing conditions.

        research_basis: Magnesium has very poor corrosion resistance in most environments
          due to its high chemical reactivity and the non-protective nature of its
          surface film. It corrodes readily in moist air, saltwater, and in the presence
          of many chemicals, ranking it among the least corrosion-resistant structural
          metals.

        research_basis: The flexural strength of magnesium is highly dependent on
          its alloy and temper condition. For a common, representative magnesium alloy
          like AZ91 in the cast condition, authoritative materials databases (ASM,
          Key to Metals) report flexural yield strengths in the range of 130-160 MPa.
          The value of 130 MPa is a conservative and well-cited figure for a standard
          3-point bend test on a common cast alloy, providing a realistic baseline.
          Pure magnesium would be lower, but engineering applications typically use
          alloys.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness of magnesium is highly dependent on
          processing method, grain size, texture, and alloying. Pure magnesium typically
          ranges from 15-40 MPa·√m, with cast materials at the lower end and fine-grained
          wrought materials at the higher end. The wide range reflects magnesium's
          HCP structure and sensitivity to processing conditions.
