      research_basis: The compressive strength of pure (99.97%) Indium is listed as
        4.2 MPa (or 600 psi) on the authoritative MatWeb database. This low value
        is consistent with Indium's extreme softness and low hardness (0.9 MPa), as
        it is one of the softest metals. The value represents a standard test at room
        temperature.

      research_basis: Indium exhibits high resistance to corrosion in atmospheric
        conditions and by many alkalis. It does not oxidize easily in air and is stable
        in water, contributing to its use in protective coatings and solders. Its
        primary vulnerability is to certain strong acids and halogens.

    flexuralStrength:

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal with a low melting
        point (156.6 °C). Its flexural strength is not a commonly reported property,
        as it is not a structural material and yields plastically under very low stress.
        The provided value is an estimate derived from its known ultimate tensile
        strength (2.5 - 3 MPa) and yield strength (1 - 11 MPa), as reported by MatWeb.
        For such a soft material, flexural strength in a 3-point bend test would be
        expected to be very low and comparable to its tensile strength.

      research_basis: Indium has a low melting point of 156.6 °C. Authoritative sources
        like the ASM Handbook indicate that while a thin oxide film forms at room
        temperature, significant oxidation that compromises the metal's integrity
        and usability begins at temperatures approaching its melting point, around
        150 °C in air. This temperature is widely cited in materials science references
        as the practical upper limit for continuous service.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal (hardness ~0.9
        MPa) with a face-centered cubic crystal structure that allows for extensive
        plastic deformation. For such materials, linear elastic fracture mechanics
        (LEFM) and the concept of a valid K_IC are often not applicable as they yield
        extensively before fracture. The reported value is an extremely low estimate
        based on its correlation with yield strength and hardness for very soft, non-work-hardening
        metals, indicating it has virtually no resistance to crack propagation in
        the LEFM sense. Direct, standardized K_IC measurements for indium are not
        commonly reported in the literature due to its dominant ductility.
