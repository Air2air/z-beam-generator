  beforeText: Under microscopy, the indium surface appears very-very contaminated
    with fine dust particles and oily residues that cling tightly and spread unevenly.
    These contaminants cause degradation, so pits and scratches form, making the metal
    look rough and dull.
  afterText: The cleaned Indium surface restores very-very smoothly and appears pristine.
    Material integrity remains intact, so quality is high.

        research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal with a low melting
          point (156.6 °C). Its flexural strength is not a commonly reported property,
          as it is not a structural material and yields plastically under very low
          stress. The provided value is an estimate derived from its known ultimate
          tensile strength (2.5 - 3 MPa) and yield strength (1 - 11 MPa), as reported
          by MatWeb. For such a soft material, flexural strength in a 3-point bend
          test would be expected to be very low and comparable to its tensile strength.

        research_basis: Indium is an extremely soft and ductile metal (hardness ~0.9
          MPa) with a face-centered cubic crystal structure that allows for extensive
          plastic deformation. For such materials, linear elastic fracture mechanics
          (LEFM) and the concept of a valid K_IC are often not applicable as they
          yield extensively before fracture. The reported value is an extremely low
          estimate based on its correlation with yield strength and hardness for very
          soft, non-work-hardening metals, indicating it has virtually no resistance
          to crack propagation in the LEFM sense. Direct, standardized K_IC measurements
          for indium are not commonly reported in the literature due to its dominant
          ductility.
