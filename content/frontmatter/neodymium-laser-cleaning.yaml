  description: Microscopic analysis of Neodymium surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the neodymium surface shows heavy contamination with
    oily residues and fine dust particles clinging tightly. This rare-earth material
    reveals pitting and light oxidation, degrading its smooth finish and exposing
    underlying vulnerabilities.
  afterText: "Laser cleaning restores neodymium surfaces by removing contaminants\
    \ gently. The cleaned surface looks smooth and even, with its natural shine back\
    \ in place. This method demonstrates excellent restoration quality, and material\
    \ integrity stays strong\u2014no cracks or weakening in the rare-earth structure.\
    \ It suits general cleaning needs well."
