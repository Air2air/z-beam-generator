title: Neodymium Laser Cleaning
faq:
- question: Is it safe to laser clean neodymium magnets, and what are the specific risks?
  answer: Laser cleaning neodymium magnets is high-risk due to their extreme flammability and toxic fume generation from rare earth oxides. The 1064nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² can easily cause demagnetization from heat, unlike safer rust removal. You must use robust fume extraction and strictly control thermal input to prevent ignition.
- question: What is the best laser wavelength and parameter settings for cleaning a neodymium component without damaging it?
  answer: For neodymium component cleaning, the optimal 1064 nm wavelength is ideal due to its high absorption. Use a low fluence near 5.1 J/cm² with high-frequency pulses to effectively remove oxides while preventing substrate damage. This approach leverages the material's thermal properties to ablate contaminants without generating excessive heat.
- question: Can laser cleaning remove the nickel-copper-nickel plating from a neodymium magnet without affecting the magnetic properties?
  answer: Removing Ni-Cu-Ni plating from NdFeB magnets is extremely challenging. The thermal threshold for magnetic degradation is only ~150°C, while achieving effective ablation requires careful fluence control near 5.1 J/cm². This high-risk process demands exceptional thermal management to prevent irreversible magnetic loss.
- question: How do you handle the toxic fumes generated when laser cleaning neodymium alloys?
  answer: Neodymium's low oxidation resistance of 0.15°C necessitates robust fume extraction. We use HEPA/ULPA filtration with activated carbon to capture heavy metal aerosols, ensuring airborne particulate levels remain below 1 mg/m³ for operator safety.
- question: Why does the surface of a neodymium magnet turn black or discolored after laser cleaning?
  answer: The black discoloration is surface oxidation from laser heating, as neodymium's low oxidation resistance (0.15°C) makes it highly reactive. This thin oxide layer typically doesn't affect magnetic performance. To minimize it, use a lower fluence near 5.1 J/cm² and a faster scan speed.
- question: What is the risk of a fire when laser cleaning neodymium, and how is it mitigated?
  answer: Neodymium iron boron is pyrophoric, with fine particulates igniting spontaneously. We mitigate this using inert argon shielding at 1064 nm wavelength and maintaining strict housekeeping. A Class D extinguisher is mandatory for the reactive metal powders generated during laser cleaning.
- question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for preparing neodymium surfaces for recoating or re-plating?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² fluence effectively removes contaminants from neodymium, creating an ideal surface for recoating. However, its low oxidation resistance of 0.15°C requires meticulous thermal control with 50% beam overlap to prevent oxide formation that would impair adhesion.
- question: How does the high reactivity and corrosion tendency of neodymium affect the laser cleaning process and post-cleaning handling?
  answer: Neodymium's low oxidation resistance means a freshly laser-cleaned surface at 5.1 J/cm² will rapidly re-oxidize. This cleaning step must immediately precede applying a protective oil or coating within a controlled environment to prevent corrosion.
- question: What are the key differences between laser cleaning a pure neodymium metal versus a common NdFeB magnet?
  answer: Cleaning pure neodymium requires extreme care due to its 0.265 HV softness and extreme pyrophoricity, demanding inert atmosphere shielding. In contrast, NdFeB magnets, while still hazardous, are more robust; their iron content alters fume composition and allows for slightly higher fluence near 5.1 J/cm², but both materials present a significant fire risk during laser processing.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to selectively remove corrosion (rust) from a sintered neodymium magnet without damaging the plating?
  answer: While theoretically possible with precise 5.1 J/cm² fluence control, selectively ablating rust from pinholes without damaging the intact plating is extremely difficult. The magnet's low 0.265 HV hardness and 16.5 W/(m·K) conductivity make it highly susceptible to thermal damage, rendering this approach impractical for widespread corrosion.
