    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1000.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of soda-lime glass is significantly
        higher than its tensile strength. While tensile strength is typically in the
        30-90 MPa range, the compressive strength is consistently cited in engineering
        references as being on the order of 1,000 MPa (1 GPa). This high value is
        due to the amorphous structure of glass, which is not susceptible to the dislocation
        movement that limits the compressive strength of crystalline materials. The
        value can vary based on surface condition and test method, but 1000 MPa is
        a standard reference value for bulk material.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Soda-lime glass exhibits excellent resistance to water, acidic
        solutions, and atmospheric conditions. While susceptible to strong alkaline
        solutions, it maintains high chemical stability against most common environmental
        corrodants including weathering, moisture, and many chemicals. The Corning
        Museum notes soda-lime glass's "good chemical durability" with only slight
        susceptibility to alkaline attack, supporting a high rating for general environmental
        corrosion resistance.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 50.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Soda-lime glass, being a brittle material, has a well-documented
        flexural strength typically ranging from 30-90 MPa. The value of 50 MPa represents
        a conservative, commonly cited average for bulk, non-tempered soda-lime glass
        tested in a 4-point bend configuration as per the ASTM standard, which is
        the definitive test method for this property. The strength is highly dependent
        on surface quality and test conditions.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 450.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Soda-lime glass has a maximum continuous service temperature
        of 400-450°C in air before thermal degradation begins. Above this range, viscosity
        decreases significantly and surface oxidation/crystallization can occur, though
        soda-lime glass doesn't oxidize like metals but rather undergoes structural
        changes and surface devitrification.

      research_basis: Soda-lime glass is a classic brittle material with very low
        fracture toughness. Multiple standardized tests and engineering references
        consistently report values in the range of 0.70-0.80 MPa·√m, with 0.75 MPa·√m
        being a widely accepted representative value for common soda-lime glass compositions
        at room temperature.
