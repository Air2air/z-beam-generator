  beforeText: Microscopy reveals the contaminated soda-lime glass surface dotted with
    fine dust particles and thin organic films. This condition shows degradation through
    small pits and scratches, dulling the surface's clarity, smoothness, and overall
    appearance.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the soda-lime glass surface appears smooth and
    clear, free from contaminants like dust or residues. This restoration demonstrates
    high quality, with no visible scratches or haze. The material's integrity remains
    intact, preserving its transparency and strength for everyday uses such as windows
    or containers. And, the process ensures even treatment across the surface, enhancing
    durability without altering the glass's natural properties.
