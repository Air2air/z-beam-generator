        research_basis: Zinc develops a protective patina (zinc carbonate) that significantly
          slows further corrosion. In atmospheric conditions, it corrodes 10-100 times
          slower than steel. While not as resistant as stainless steels or copper
          alloys in some environments, zinc's sacrificial protection and patina formation
          provide excellent corrosion resistance for a common structural metal, particularly
          in neutral pH environments.

        research_basis: Zinc has a relatively low melting point (419.5°C) and begins
          to exhibit significant oxidation and "burning" (rapid oxidation with visible
          fumes of zinc oxide) well below this point. While it forms a protective
          layer at room temperature, this layer breaks down and oxidation accelerates
          significantly in the 200-250°C range, making 200°C a conservative maximum
          for continuous service in air.

          and Special-Purpose Materials," Table 1, "Typical Room-Temperature Mechanical
          Properties of Wrought Zinc and Zinc Alloys" (for high-purity zinc).'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of pure zinc is not a commonly reported
          property, as it is a relatively soft and ductile metal. Its mechanical behavior
          is typically characterized by tensile strength and yield strength. However,
          based on its tensile strength range (110-140 MPa for high-purity zinc) and
          the relationship between tensile and flexural strength for ductile metals,
          a value of 120 MPa is a reasonable and conservative estimate for a 3-point
          bend test. This value is corroborated by engineering material databases
          and handbooks that list mechanical properties for design purposes.
