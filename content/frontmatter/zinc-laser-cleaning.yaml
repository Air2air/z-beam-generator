caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the zinc surface reveals contamination with clustered
    dark particles and hazy films. These contaminants, likely oxides and processing
    residues, adhere unevenly and promote pitting, degrading the metal's integrity
    for automotive and die casting uses.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the zinc surface appears smooth and uniform, free
    from oxides, dirt, and residues that often build up in automotive or construction
    parts. This treatment restores the metal's natural shine and texture without pitting
    or discoloration. The restoration quality is high, and it maintains zinc's integrity—its
    ductility and corrosion resistance stay intact for reliable die casting applications.
    Overall, the process ensures a clean, ready-to-use surface.
