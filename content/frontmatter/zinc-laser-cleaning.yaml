caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the zinc surface reveals contamination with clustered dark particles and hazy films. These
    contaminants, likely oxides and processing residues, adhere unevenly and promote pitting, degrading the metal's integrity
    for automotive and die casting uses.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the zinc surface appears smooth and uniform, free from oxides, dirt, and residues that
    often build up in automotive or construction parts. This treatment restores the metal's natural shine and texture without
    pitting or discoloration. The restoration quality is high, and it maintains zinc's integrity—its ductility and corrosion
    resistance stay intact for reliable die casting applications. Overall, the process ensures a clean, ready-to-use surface.

faq:
- question: Can laser cleaning be used on galvanized steel without removing the zinc coating?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning works well on galvanized steel to strip away surface oxides without stripping the zinc layer.
    Tune to 5.1 J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm wavelength with 10 ns pulses, keeping scans at 500 mm/s for precise control. Automotive
    industry reports show it preserves galvanization's rust barrier effectively.
- question: What are the risks of zinc oxide fume generation during laser cleaning of zinc surfaces?
  answer: Laser cleaning zinc surfaces at 5.1 J/cm² fluence can generate zinc oxide fumes, which are toxic and may cause metal
    fume fever or respiratory issues if inhaled. Exposure limits stand at 5 mg/m³ per safety standards, so use robust local
    exhaust ventilation during 100 W operations to minimize health risks and ensure worker safety.
- question: How do I set laser parameters for effective cleaning of zinc oxide layers without damaging the underlying metal?
  answer: For effective zinc oxide removal without substrate damage, select a 1064 nm wavelength for strong absorption and
    low reflectivity on zinc surfaces. Employ 10 ns pulses at 5.1 J/cm² energy density to ablate the layer precisely, maintaining
    thermal balance during the process.
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for removing contaminants from zinc-coated roofs or structures?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes contaminants from zinc-coated roofs while preserving their corrosion resistance.
    With a 1064 nm wavelength and 5.1 J/cm² fluence, it ablates oxides without substrate melting, as shared in hardware manufacturing
    forums for galvanizing restoration.
- question: What PPE is required when laser cleaning zinc alloys due to potential vaporization?
  answer: When laser cleaning zinc alloys at 5.1 J/cm² fluence, vaporization generates hazardous zinc oxide fumes. Prioritize
    NIOSH-approved respirators with P100 cartridges for inhalation risks, alongside laser-specific eye protection. Adhere
    to OSHA standards for safe exposure limits under 5 mg/m³.
- question: Does laser cleaning cause discoloration or oxidation on zinc surfaces after treatment?
  answer: Proper laser cleaning on zinc avoids discoloration or oxidation when using a 5.1 J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm wavelength,
    which ablates surface oxides precisely without substrate melting. Keeping power at 100 W and scan speed to 500 mm/s ensures
    uniform treatment and preserves the metal's natural finish.
- question: What is the melting point of zinc and how does it affect laser cleaning processes?
  answer: Zinc melts at 419.5°C, a low threshold that demands careful energy control in laser cleaning to ablate surface oxides
    without substrate fusion. Using 5.1 J/cm² fluence at 1064 nm wavelength prevents thermal damage, enabling uniform treatment
    for automotive and die-casting parts via nanosecond pulses.
- question: Are there specific laser wavelengths that work best for cleaning zinc without excessive heat buildup?
  answer: For zinc cleaning, the 1064 nm near-infrared wavelength excels due to strong absorption in its spectrum, reducing
    reflectivity and heat accumulation compared to shorter wavelengths. Pair it with a 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 100 W power for
    precise oxide ablation while preserving the metal surface.
- question: How does zinc's reactivity influence the choice of laser cleaning over chemical methods?
  answer: Zinc's high reactivity heightens corrosion risks with chemical cleaners, especially in galvanizing or automotive
    uses, where acids could etch the substrate. Laser methods sidestep this by ablating oxides at a safe 5.1 J/cm² fluence
    with 1064 nm wavelength, delivering precise, non-contact cleaning that's environmentally friendlier, as industry forums
    emphasize.
