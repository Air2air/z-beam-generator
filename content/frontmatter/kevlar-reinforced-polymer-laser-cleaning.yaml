  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface shows irregular
    patches of fine dust particles and viscous oily films. These contaminants embed
    deeply, inducing micro-cracks and early matrix degradation.
  afterText: The laser cleaning restores the Kevlar-reinforced polymer surface to
    a pristine, contaminant-free state. Material integrity remains intact, with fibers
    undamaged and polymer matrix smooth, ensuring full structural reliability.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of Kevlar-reinforced polymer composites
          is highly dependent on the polymer matrix (typically epoxy), fiber volume
          fraction, and fiber architecture. For unidirectional Kevlar 49/epoxy with
          a typical fiber volume fraction of 60%, authoritative military handbook
          data reports a longitudinal compressive strength in the range of 138-517
          MPa. The lower end represents a basic unidirectional laminate, while the
          517 MPa value is achieved with optimized sizings and processing for improved
          compressive performance, which is the most relevant for a high-performance
          composite as suggested by the provided properties.

        research_basis: Kevlar-reinforced polymers exhibit excellent resistance to
          most environmental corrosion factors including moisture, salt spray, and
          chemical exposure. The polymer matrix provides protection against galvanic
          corrosion, and Kevlar fibers themselves are inherently resistant to chemical
          degradation and do not rust like metals. However, some susceptibility exists
          to UV degradation and hydrolysis in extreme conditions, preventing a perfect
          rating.

        research_basis: Kevlar aramid fiber, the reinforcing component in this composite,
          has a maximum continuous service temperature of 177°C (350°F) in air. Above
          this temperature, the polymer begins significant thermal degradation and
          oxidation, leading to loss of mechanical properties. The polymer matrix
          (typically epoxy or similar) generally has a lower thermal tolerance than
          the Kevlar fibers, making the fiber properties the limiting factor for long-term
          oxidative stability.

          where the Kevlar fibers provide substantial crack bridging and pull-out
          mechanisms that enhance toughness compared to the polymer matrix alone.
