        wood species and wood-based composites'
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 5.5
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of plywood is highly dependent on the
        species of the face veneers, the adhesive type, and the direction of loading
        (parallel or perpendicular to the face grain). The cited source provides a
        typical range of 4.8 to 6.2 MPa for compressive strength perpendicular to
        the face grain for common softwood plywood, with 5.5 MPa being a representative
        median value. This value is consistent with data from other engineering handbooks
        for construction-grade plywood.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Plywood, typically made from wood veneers, has poor inherent
        corrosion resistance as it is highly susceptible to moisture, fungal decay,
        and insect attack. The "Wood Handbook" states that untreated wood products
        have low durability and require protective treatments for any exterior or
        damp service conditions. While corrosion is a metal-specific term, in the
        context of material degradation, plywood's organic composition makes it highly
        vulnerable to environmental degradation. A rating of 2 reflects that it offers
        minimal resistance without chemical preservatives.
    density:
      value: 0.54
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material (USDA Forest
        Service, FPL-GTR-190), Chapter 12: Plywood and Structural Wood Panels, Table
        12-1: Typical properties of commercial plywood'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 30.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of plywood varies significantly based
        on species, veneer grade, adhesive type, and construction. The cited USDA
        source provides typical MOR (Modulus of Rupture) values for commercial softwood
        plywood in the range of 20-40 MPa. The value of 30 MPa represents a reasonable
        median for structural softwood plywood, consistent with values reported in
        engineering material databases for general-purpose construction plywood.
    hardness:
      value: 1813.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASTM D143-14 Standard Test Methods for Small Clear Specimens
        of Timber, supplemented by Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material
        (USDA Forest Service, 2010) and specific plywood mechanical property studies'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Plywood, as an engineered wood product, has thermal degradation
        properties similar to solid wood. The Wood Handbook states that wood in air
        begins significant thermal decomposition around 200°C, with the onset of pyrolysis
        where chemical bonds break and mass loss occurs. This represents the maximum
        temperature before rapid oxidation and charring begins, making it unsuitable
        for continuous service above this threshold.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Plywood, as a wood-based composite, has low fracture toughness
        perpendicular to the grain. Authoritative composite materials references provide
        K_IC values for wood in the range of 0.3-0.7 MPa·√m, with 0.5 MPa·√m being
        a representative mid-range value for structural plywood in the crack-arrester
        orientation.
