    thermalExpansion:
      value: 3.25
      unit: 10⁻⁶/K
      research_basis: ASTM E228-17 Standard Test Method for Linear Thermal Expansion
        of Solid Materials & Corning Incorporated technical datasheets for borosilicate
        glass (Pyrex 7740 composition)
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 280.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Borosilicate glass compressive strength typically ranges from
        280-650 MPa depending on specific composition and surface quality. The lower
        end (280 MPa) represents a conservative, widely cited value for annealed laboratory
        borosilicate glass (e.g., Pyrex, Duran) from manufacturer technical data sheets.
        Higher values up to 650 MPa apply to pristine, flaw-free specimens under ideal
        laboratory conditions.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Borosilicate glass exhibits exceptional chemical durability
        against water, acidic solutions, and saline solutions, with very low corrosion
        rates. It shows excellent resistance to all acids except hydrofluoric acid
        and phosphoric acid. Alkaline solutions cause slightly higher corrosion rates,
        but still significantly lower than ordinary soda-lime glass. This high chemical
        inertness qualifies it for laboratory and industrial applications where corrosion
        resistance is critical.
    density:
      value: 2.23
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'ASTM E438-92 Standard Specification for Glasses in Laboratory
        Apparatus, Corning Glass Works Material Specifications for Pyrex 7740, and
        Scholze, H. ''Glass: Nature, Structure, and Properties'' (1991)'
    electricalResistivity:
      value: 150000000.0
      unit: Ω·m
      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 60.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Borosilicate glass, while strong in compression, is a brittle
        material with a flexural strength highly dependent on surface quality and
        test conditions. Authoritative technical datasheets and materials science
        references (e.g., Corning, Schott) consistently report a typical flexural
        strength in the range of 50-70 MPa for laboratory-scale tests on pristine
        specimens. The value of 60 MPa is a representative median for a 3-point bend
        test, though real-world strength is often lower due to microscopic surface
        flaws.
    hardness:
      value: 5.5
      unit: Mohs
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 2: Properties and Selection: Nonferrous
        Alloys and Special-Purpose Materials (ASM International, 1990), Section: ''Glass
        and Glass Ceramics'''
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 500.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for borosilicate
        glass (e.g., Corning Pyrex 7740) is consistently cited as 500°C by major manufacturers
        and technical data sheets. This is the temperature limit for long-term use
        before thermal creep or structural degradation begins, which serves as a practical
        upper limit for oxidation resistance in an air atmosphere.
    tensileStrength:
      value: 35.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 19: Fatigue and Fracture, ''Fracture of
        Glass'' (ASM International, 1996) and Corning Incorporated technical data
        sheets for borosilicate glass compositions'

        documentation for borosilicate glasses (Pyrex-type), and Materials Science
        & Engineering literature (Bansal & Doremus, 'Handbook of Glass Properties')
    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.77
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Borosilicate glass (e.g., Pyrex) has low fracture toughness
        typical of oxide glasses. The value 0.77 MPa·√m is widely cited in materials
        databases and fracture mechanics literature for annealed borosilicate glass,
        consistent with its brittle behavior and lack of plastic deformation.
