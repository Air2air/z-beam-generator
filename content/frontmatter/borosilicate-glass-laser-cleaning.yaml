caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the borosilicate glass surface reveals a contaminated
    condition with scattered fine dust particles and oily residues from handling.
    These contaminants form irregular clusters and streaks, adhering tightly and causing
    minor surface pitting along with reduced transparency. This degradation affects
    optical clarity, and cleaning restores integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the borosilicate glass surface regains its original
    clarity and smoothness. This process removes contaminants without altering the
    material's thermal stability or optical properties. The restoration quality is
    high, with no micro-cracks or haze, preserving integrity for everyday uses like
    labware and optics. It shows uniform shine, ready for reliable performance.

        research_basis: Borosilicate glass compressive strength typically ranges from
          280-650 MPa depending on specific composition and surface quality. The lower
          end (280 MPa) represents a conservative, widely cited value for annealed
          laboratory borosilicate glass (e.g., Pyrex, Duran) from manufacturer technical
          data sheets. Higher values up to 650 MPa apply to pristine, flaw-free specimens
          under ideal laboratory conditions.

        research_basis: Borosilicate glass exhibits exceptional chemical durability
          against water, acidic solutions, and saline solutions, with very low corrosion
          rates. It shows excellent resistance to all acids except hydrofluoric acid
          and phosphoric acid. Alkaline solutions cause slightly higher corrosion
          rates, but still significantly lower than ordinary soda-lime glass. This
          high chemical inertness qualifies it for laboratory and industrial applications
          where corrosion resistance is critical.

        research_basis: Borosilicate glass, while strong in compression, is a brittle
          material with a flexural strength highly dependent on surface quality and
          test conditions. Authoritative technical datasheets and materials science
          references (e.g., Corning, Schott) consistently report a typical flexural
          strength in the range of 50-70 MPa for laboratory-scale tests on pristine
          specimens. The value of 60 MPa is a representative median for a 3-point
          bend test, though real-world strength is often lower due to microscopic
          surface flaws.
