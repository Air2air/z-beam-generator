  description: Microscopic analysis of Borosilicate Glass surface before and after
    laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the borosilicate glass surface reveals a contaminated
    condition with scattered fine dust particles and oily residues from handling.
    These contaminants form irregular clusters and streaks, adhering tightly and causing
    minor surface pitting along with reduced transparency. This degradation affects
    optical clarity, and cleaning restores integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the borosilicate glass surface regains its original
    clarity and smoothness. This process removes contaminants without altering the
    material's thermal stability or optical properties. The restoration quality is
    high, with no micro-cracks or haze, preserving integrity for everyday uses like
    labware and optics. It shows uniform shine, ready for reliable performance.
