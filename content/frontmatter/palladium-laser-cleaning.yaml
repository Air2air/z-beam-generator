        research_basis: Palladium is a noble metal with high resistance to oxidation
          and tarnishing in ambient air. It is resistant to sulfur compounds that
          readily tarnish silver, and it shows excellent stability in many chemical
          environments, including non-oxidizing acids. Its primary vulnerability is
          to strong oxidizing agents like nitric acid and aqua regia, which prevents
          a perfect 9-10 rating reserved for metals like gold.

          and Palladium Alloys"'
        research_basis: Palladium has good oxidation resistance up to ~790°C, where
          a stable, protective PdO oxide layer forms. Above this temperature, the
          oxide decomposes (PdO → Pd + ½O₂), leading to a breakdown of the protective
          scale and the onset of significant oxidation, often referred to as its "oxidation
          resistance temperature."

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Properties of Wrought Palladium and Palladium
          Alloys"'
        research_basis: Palladium is a noble metal known for its ductility and malleability
          rather than high strength. Its flexural strength is not a commonly reported
          property, as it is typically used in applications that do not require significant
          structural strength. The provided value is an estimate based on the relationship
          between ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and flexural strength for ductile
          metals. For pure, annealed palladium, the typical UTS ranges from 170-190
          MPa. For ductile materials, the flexural strength in a 3-point bend test
          is approximately equivalent to the UTS. This value represents the lower
          end of the expected UTS range for pure, annealed palladium, which serves
          as a reasonable proxy for its flexural strength.

        research_basis: The provided hardness value of 400.0 MPa is a Vickers hardness
          (HV). For many pure, ductile metals like palladium, the compressive strength
          is approximately equal to the Vickers hardness value. This correlation is
          a standard engineering approximation, as compressive strength is not a commonly
          reported property for such materials, which are typically characterized
          by their hardness and tensile properties.
