caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated palladium surface shows a layer of fine
    dust particles and organic films scattered across it. This coverage causes visible
    degradation, with small pits and rough patches forming on the metal. It highlights
    cleaning challenges for this durable material.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the palladium surface looks smooth and shiny, free
    from dirt or oxidation. This treatment reveals a restored condition with no pitting
    or scratches. The metal's integrity stays intact, and its natural properties—like
    ductility and corrosion resistance—remain unchanged. Overall, it returns to a
    clean state ready for use in jewelry or catalysis.

          is approximately equal to the Vickers hardness value. This correlation is

          and tarnishing in ambient air. It is resistant to sulfur compounds that
          readily tarnish silver, and it shows excellent stability in many chemical
          environments, including non-oxidizing acids. Its primary vulnerability is
          to strong oxidizing agents like nitric acid and aqua regia, which prevents
          a perfect 9-10 rating reserved for metals like gold.

        research_basis: Palladium is a noble metal known for its ductility and malleability
          rather than high strength. Its flexural strength is not a commonly reported
          property, as it is typically used in applications that do not require significant
          structural strength. The provided value is an estimate based on the relationship
          between ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and flexural strength for ductile
          metals. For pure, annealed palladium, the typical UTS ranges from 170-190
          MPa. For ductile materials, the flexural strength in a 3-point bend test
          is approximately equivalent to the UTS. This value represents the lower
          end of the expected UTS range for pure, annealed palladium, which serves
          as a reasonable proxy for its flexural strength.

          The reported K_IC value for high-purity, annealed palladium falls in the
          range of 70-90 MPa·√m. The lower end of this range (70 MPa·√m) is cited
          for consistency with conservative engineering design values and accounts
          for potential minor impurities in commercial material.
