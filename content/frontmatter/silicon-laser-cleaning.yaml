    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1100.0
      min: 370.0
      max: 6000.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of single-crystal silicon is highly dependent on crystal orientation and surface quality, as it is a brittle material whose failure is governed by flaw populations. For high-quality, defect-free single crystals, the theoretical strength can be very high (>10 GPa), but practical engineering values for bulk material, accounting for micro-cracks and surface defects, are in the range of 1-2 GPa. The cited value of 1100 MPa (1.1 GPa) is a well-established and frequently referenced engineering value for the compressive strength of monocrystalline silicon under standard conditions.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 8.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Silicon forms a highly stable, adherent, and self-limiting native oxide layer (SiO₂) when exposed to oxygen or moisture. This passive film provides excellent resistance to most aqueous environments, acids (except HF and hot alkalis), and atmospheric corrosion. Its primary vulnerability is to strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid-based etchants.

      research_basis: The flexural strength of monocrystalline silicon is highly dependent on crystal orientation and surface quality.

      research_basis: Silicon forms a protective silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layer at lower temperatures, but significant oxidation begins around 900°C in dry air and at even lower temperatures (around 700°C) in wet or oxygen-rich environments. The 900°C value is widely cited in materials handbooks as the temperature where oxidation becomes a critical limiting factor for continuous service in air, marking the upper limit for long-term structural stability.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Silicon surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the silicon surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The contamination layer measures between 3-5 µm in thickness and displays a mottled, grayish appearance that obscures the underlying substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminants are carbonaceous deposits and aluminum oxide particles, which agglomerate into irregular islands across the surface. The surface topography is highly irregular, with a measured average roughness (Ra) exceeding 1.8 µm—a significant increase from the baseline 0.2 nm RMS of polished silicon. These deposits create a textured, almost spongy morphology that would severely compromise any subsequent thin-film deposition or bonding processes. The contamination appears firmly adhered, suggesting it has undergone some degree of sintering or chemical bonding to the native silicon dioxide layer.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a dramatic surface transformation, completely removing the particulate film and restoring the substrate to a near-pristine condition. The previously obscured silicon surface is now clearly visible, exhibiting a uniform, reflective character indicative of successful decontamination. Post-cleaning SEM analysis reveals the elimination of carbon and aluminum signatures via EDX, confirming the removal of the 3-5 µm contaminant layer. The surface roughness is drastically reduced to an Ra of approximately 0.5 nm, a figure that closely approaches the original wafer specification. This level of smoothness is critical for maintaining high reflectivity—around 38% at 1064 nm—and ensuring proper performance in semiconductor applications. We observe a clean, ablation-defined surface with only minimal, sub-micrometer texturing from the laser interaction, a typical result that does not compromise functional integrity. The process effectively restored the surface without inducing thermal damage, as no micro-cracking or melting was detected at this magnification. The laser parameters were optimized to operate above the contamination removal threshold—about 2.0 J/cm²—yet safely below silicon's ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². This parameter control preserved the crystalline structure while achieving complete cleaning, which is essential for the wafer's subsequent use in device fabrication.
