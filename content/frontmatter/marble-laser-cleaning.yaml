    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Marble (primarily calcite/dolomite) has excellent resistance
        to atmospheric environmental corrosion and maintains structural integrity
        in most outdoor applications. However, it is susceptible to acidic corrosion
        from acid rain or pollutants, which prevents a perfect rating. ASTM standards
        recognize marble's high durability in normal environmental conditions while
        noting its chemical sensitivity.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 15.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Flexural strength for marble is typically 10-20 MPa. The provided
        value of 15 MPa is a well-established average for commercial marble (like
        Carrara) based on standardized 4-point bend tests (ASTM C880), representing
        a typical value for this relatively brittle, high-compressive-strength stone.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 400.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Marble (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃) undergoes a chemical decomposition
        process (calcination) beginning around 400-450°C in air, where it breaks down
        into calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide. This is not oxidation in
        the metallic sense but is the temperature at which significant degradation
        in an oxidative (air) atmosphere begins, defining its maximum service temperature.

        of Dimension Stone, with tensile strength calculated using established rock
        mechanics relationships (tensile strength ≈ 8-12% of compressive strength
        for marble)

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.08
      min: 0.5
      max: 5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Marble is a relatively soft rock with low fracture toughness.
        Authoritative compilations of rock fracture toughness (K_IC) place the typical
        range for marble between 0.7 and 1.5 MPa·√m. The value of 1.08 MPa·√m is a
        representative median value from these experimental data sets, which is consistent
        with its known low hardness and moderate compressive strength.
