caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the marble surface shows heavy-heavy contamination,
    with fine dust particles and organic residues clinging tightly. These contaminants
    form irregular clusters, blocking natural pores and causing discoloration that
    appears dull-dull and uneven. Surface degradation is evident in micro-cracks and
    etching, where acids from pollutants erode the stone slowly, weakening its structure
    and making it prone to further damage over time.
  afterText: The marble surface is cleaned then restored very-very smoothly. It appears
    shiny and original color returns fully. Material integrity stays preserved, no
    cracks or damage. So, restoration quality is excellent for stone applications.
