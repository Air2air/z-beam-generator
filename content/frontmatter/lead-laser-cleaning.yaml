caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the lead surface reveals a heavily contaminated condition,
    with irregular oxide layers and particulate debris adhering tightly, causing pitting,
    micro-cracks, and overall degradation that dulls its metallic sheen.
  afterText: The lead surface, now impeccably cleaned via laser ablation, reveals
    a smooth, uniform finish free from oxides and residues. This restoration excels
    in quality, fully preserving the metal's integrity—its density, malleability,
    and corrosion resistance remain unaltered. Such precision ensures reliable performance
    in diverse applications.

        research_basis: Lead is an exceptionally soft, malleable metal with no distinct
          yield point. Its compressive strength is highly dependent on purity, strain
          rate, and temperature. For commercially pure lead, authoritative materials
          handbooks report compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) typically in the
          range of 12-18 MPa under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature,
          quasi-static loading). The value overlaps significantly with its tensile
          strength due to its low capacity for work hardening.

          and many chemicals (especially sulfuric acid) due to its protective oxide
          layer, but has very poor resistance to corrosion in soft/acidic waters,
          soils, and many organic acids. Its overall rating is low because it corrodes
          significantly in common environmental conditions like drinking water distribution
          systems and soil burial, with corrosion rates typically 0.0005-0.002 inches
          per year in various environments.

        research_basis: Lead is an extremely soft, malleable metal with negligible
          capacity for elastic deformation. Its flexural strength is not a primary
          design property and is rarely tested directly. The value of ~12 MPa is derived
          from its ultimate tensile strength, which is well-documented in authoritative
          materials handbooks (e.g., ASM) as being in the 12-18 MPa range for pure
          lead. Since bending failure is governed by tensile stress, this value serves
          as a conservative and representative estimate of its flexural strength.

          oxide film at room temperature, significant oxidation begins above approximately
          400°C (750°F). This temperature is well below lead's melting point of 327.5°C,
          meaning molten lead oxidizes readily. The 400°C threshold is widely cited
          in materials science references for the onset of substantial oxidation in
          air.
