    compressiveStrength:
      value: 15.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Lead is an exceptionally soft, malleable metal with no distinct
        yield point. Its compressive strength is highly dependent on purity, strain
        rate, and temperature. For commercially pure lead, authoritative materials
        handbooks report compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) typically in the
        range of 12-18 MPa under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature,
        quasi-static loading). The value overlaps significantly with its tensile strength
        due to its low capacity for work hardening.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Lead exhibits excellent resistance to atmospheric corrosion
        and many chemicals (especially sulfuric acid) due to its protective oxide
        layer, but has very poor resistance to corrosion in soft/acidic waters, soils,
        and many organic acids. Its overall rating is low because it corrodes significantly
        in common environmental conditions like drinking water distribution systems
        and soil burial, with corrosion rates typically 0.0005-0.002 inches per year
        in various environments.

      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 12.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Lead is an extremely soft, malleable metal with negligible capacity
        for elastic deformation. Its flexural strength is not a primary design property
        and is rarely tested directly. The value of ~12 MPa is derived from its ultimate
        tensile strength, which is well-documented in authoritative materials handbooks
        (e.g., ASM) as being in the 12-18 MPa range for pure lead. Since bending failure
        is governed by tensile stress, this value serves as a conservative and representative
        estimate of its flexural strength.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 400.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The ASM Handbook states that while lead forms a protective oxide
        film at room temperature, significant oxidation begins above approximately
        400°C (750°F). This temperature is well below lead's melting point of 327.5°C,
        meaning molten lead oxidizes readily. The 400°C threshold is widely cited
        in materials science references for the onset of substantial oxidation in
        air.
