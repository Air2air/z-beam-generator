caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the Hastelloy surface displays heavy contamination
    with clustered particulates—oily residues and metallic debris—ranging 10-100 microns,
    embedding into the nickel alloy matrix. This buildup fosters surface degradation,
    including localized pitting and micro-cracks, eroding the material's integrity
    for laser system housings in aerospace applications.
  afterText: After cleaning Hastelloy surfaces in laser systems, restoration delivers
    a smooth, contaminant-free condition. The surface regains its original luster
    without scratches or discoloration, preserving full material integrity and corrosion
    resistance. This high-quality outcome supports reliable performance in optical
    housings, as seen in applications at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

          cracking. It is a benchmark material for chemical process industries. The

          the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The authoritative datasheet from the
          primary manufacturer, Haynes International, lists the typical UTS for Hastelloy
          C-276 (a common grade) as 724 MPa, which serves as a valid and authoritative

        research_basis: The ASM Handbook is a primary reference for metallic material
          properties. For Hastelloy C-276 (a common grade), it lists fracture toughness
          values in the range of 210-230 MPa·√m at room temperature. The provided
          value of 219 MPa·√m is a representative mid-range value for this nickel-chromium-molybdenum
          superalloy.
