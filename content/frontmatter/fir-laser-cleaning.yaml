      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties. For "Fir,"
        which typically refers to Douglas-Fir or true firs in engineering contexts,
        the compressive strength parallel to the grain is listed as 40 MPa at 12%
        moisture content, which is the standard test condition for reporting wood
        strength properties. This value is consistent with the known density and hardness
        provided.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Fir is a softwood with low natural durability against decay
        fungi, insects, and moisture. The Wood Handbook rates untreated fir species
        as "slightly to non-resistant" to decay, placing it in the lowest durability
        categories. While it has some resistance when kept dry, its performance in
        general environmental conditions with moisture exposure is poor without chemical
        treatment.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties. For "Douglas-fir"
        (a primary commercial Fir species), the handbook lists a modulus of rupture
        (MOR), which is flexural strength, of 12,400 psi, which converts to approximately
        85 MPa. However, this is for clear, straight-grained wood at 12% moisture
        content. A more conservative and commonly referenced design value for structural
        lumber (accounting for defects, knots, and long-term loading) is around 65
        MPa. The confidence is high as the source is definitive, but the specific
        value depends on the grade and moisture content, hence not a perfect 1.00.

    oxidationResistance:

      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood in air is
        generally limited to 150°C. Above this temperature, significant thermal degradation
        begins, including hemicellulose decomposition and oxidative reactions that
        permanently reduce mechanical properties. While ignition temperature for fir
        is higher (~200-300°C), the 150°C limit represents the temperature where chemical
        changes and oxidation become significant for long-term structural integrity.
