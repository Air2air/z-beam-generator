caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the fir wood surface appears heavily contaminated
    by dirt particles and sticky oils that cling tightly then degrade fibers. Rough-rough
    pits form, so texture worsens and natural protection weakens.
  afterText: The fir wood surface is cleaned thoroughly-thoroughly by the ultrafast
    laser process, removing contaminants and then restoring its natural appearance.
    The cleaned surface appears smooth-smooth and fresh-fresh, with grain patterns
    visible clearly and color even-even. Restoration quality is high-high, as material
    integrity remains intact-intact—no fibers damaged, so strength preserved well.
    This method ensures wood suitable for general applications, clean and ready-ready
    for use.

          fungi, insects, and moisture. The Wood Handbook rates untreated fir species
          as "slightly to non-resistant" to decay, placing it in the lowest durability
          categories. While it has some resistance when kept dry, its performance
          in general environmental conditions with moisture exposure is poor without
          chemical treatment.

          is the primary authoritative source for North American wood properties.
          For "Douglas-fir" (a primary commercial Fir species), the handbook lists
          a modulus of rupture (MOR), which is flexural strength, of 12,400 psi, which
          converts to approximately 85 MPa. However, this is for clear, straight-grained
          wood at 12% moisture content. A more conservative and commonly referenced
          design value for structural lumber (accounting for defects, knots, and long-term
          loading) is around 65 MPa. The confidence is high as the source is definitive,
          but the specific value depends on the grade and moisture content, hence
          not a perfect 1.00.

          temperature for fir is higher (~200-300°C), the 150°C limit represents the
