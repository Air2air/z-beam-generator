  description: Microscopic analysis of Schist surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, the schist surface reveals a foliated
    texture marred by irregular contaminants, including fine particulate dust and
    organic residues that cling to mica flakes and quartz grains. These contaminants,
    often 5-50 microns in size, form patchy films, accelerating degradation through
    micro-pitting and delamination of layers. In heritage restoration applications,
    such buildup compromises stone integrity, demanding precise cleaning to preserve
    optical clarity for laser alignment in surveying tools.
  afterText: After cleaning, the schist surface exhibits a smooth, even texture with
    restored natural luster, free from embedded grime and minor fissures. Restoration
    quality is high, preserving the stone's foliated structure without chemical degradation.
    Material integrity remains intact, as the process avoids abrasion that could weaken
    its compressive strength. In architectural applications, like heritage building
    facades, this ensures durable, aesthetically revived stonework.
