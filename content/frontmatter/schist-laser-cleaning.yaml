    compressiveStrength:
      value: 150.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of schist is highly variable (range
        ~50-300 MPa) due to its foliated nature, anisotropy, and mineral composition.
        The provided value of 150 MPa is a representative mid-range estimate for uniaxial
        compressive strength tested perpendicular to the foliation. Strength can be
        significantly lower when loaded parallel to the foliation planes.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 6.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Schist demonstrates moderate corrosion resistance due to its
        metamorphic crystalline structure and mineral composition. While more resistant
        than sedimentary rocks like limestone, it is less durable than quartz-rich
        stones like granite. Schist's foliation can create planes of weakness where
        environmental degradation may occur over time. Performance varies significantly
        based on specific mineral composition and exposure conditions.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 30.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Schist is a metamorphic rock with highly variable properties
        due to foliation. Flexural strength is highly anisotropic and depends on the
        orientation of the load relative to the foliation planes. A value of 30 MPa
        is a representative mid-range figure for tests perpendicular to the foliation,
        as cited in authoritative rock mechanics handbooks. Values can range from
        10 MPa to over 50 MPa depending on mineralogy and anisotropy.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 400.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Schist, a metamorphic rock containing sheet silicate minerals
        like mica and chlorite, begins significant dehydration and oxidation (of iron-bearing
        minerals) around 400-450°C in air. This temperature marks the onset of structural
        degradation and mass loss, defining the upper limit for continuous service
        before material properties are compromised. The provided value is a conservative
        estimate from authoritative industry sources for general schist types.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.2
      min: 0.5
      max: 5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Fracture toughness in schist is highly anisotropic and strongly
        dependent on foliation orientation. Values for schist and similar foliated
        metamorphic rocks (slate, phyllite) typically range from 0.8 to 1.5 MPa·√m
        when measured perpendicular to foliation. The provided value represents a
        reasonable average from rock mechanics literature for this material class,
        accounting for its pronounced planar fabric.
