      research_basis: Titanium Carbide is a highly stable, refractory ceramic with
        exceptional resistance to oxidation and acidic environments. Authoritative
        materials databases consistently rate its corrosion resistance as "Excellent"
        due to its strong covalent bonds and high chemical inertness, placing it in
        the top tier of engineering ceramics, though slightly below materials like
        zirconia in some specific alkaline conditions.

      research_basis: Titanium Carbide (TiC) is known to have good oxidation resistance
        up to approximately 1100°C in air, after which a non-protective titanium oxide
        scale forms, leading to significant and rapid oxidation. This value is consistent
        with data from materials engineering handbooks for non-oxide ceramics.

      research_basis: The provided value is a median figure from a compilation of
        fracture toughness data for TiC in authoritative ceramic handbooks. The range
        for polycrystalline TiC is typically reported between 3.5 and 4.5 MPa·√m,
        with 4.0 MPa·√m being a commonly cited reference value. The confidence is
        not higher due to the inherent variability in this property, which is sensitive
        to factors like porosity, grain size, and stoichiometry.
