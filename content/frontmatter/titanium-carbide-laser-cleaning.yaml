  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Titanium Carbide surface reveals a contaminated
    condition marked by irregular pitting and micro-cracks, indicative of degradation
    from environmental exposure. Contaminants appear as clustered oxide particles
    and metallic residues, roughly 5-20 microns in size, adhering unevenly and accelerating
    wear in aerospace and medical applications. This state, it compromises structural
    integrity.
  afterText: In laser-based additive manufacturing, the cleaned surface of Titanium
    Carbide—a resilient ceramic—presents a pristine, mirror-like finish free from
    residues or defects. This restoration achieves exceptional quality, with laser
    precision removing contaminants while preserving microstructure integrity. No
    cracks or porosity appear, ensuring durability for aerospace components, automotive
    parts, and medical devices. Such fidelity maintains the material's high hardness
    and thermal stability.
