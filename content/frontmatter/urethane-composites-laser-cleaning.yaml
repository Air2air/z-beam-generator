      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (high hardness of 62.5 Shore D and high
        density) are characteristic of rigid, highly cross-linked polyurethane composites,
        which are known for high compressive strength. Authoritative materials databases
        consistently report compressive strength values for rigid urethanes in the
        range of 70-110 MPa, with 80 MPa being a typical mid-range value for this
        material category and hardness level.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Urethane composites are not metals and therefore do not corrode
        via electrochemical oxidation. Their primary degradation in general environments
        is through hydrolysis, UV exposure, or chemical attack. Authoritative materials
        sources consistently rate polyurethanes as having "excellent" resistance to
        water, aqueous salts, and oxidation, which are the primary drivers of general
        environmental corrosion. Their main weakness is susceptibility to strong acids/bases
        and certain solvents, but this falls outside "general environmental" conditions.
        The rating reflects high performance against water, humidity, and salt air,
        with minor points deducted for potential long-term UV degradation if not specially
        formulated.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 55.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density 1.25 g/cm³, hardness 62.5 Shore
        D) are characteristic of rigid, glassy polyurethanes. For this category of
        high-performance urethane composites, authoritative materials databases (AZoM,
        MatWeb) report flexural strength values typically ranging from 50 MPa to 70
        MPa. The cited value of 55 MPa is a representative median for rigid urethane
        composites tested under standard 3-point bend conditions (ASTM D790). The
        confidence is not higher due to the broad nature of the "Urethane Composites"
        category, where the specific formulation (e.g., fiber reinforcement, filler
        type) can significantly influence the final mechanical property.

    oxidationResistance:

      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for polyurethane
        materials in air is consistently reported in the range of 80-90°C by material
        databases and technical datasheets. This temperature represents the upper
        limit before significant thermal degradation and oxidation processes begin,
        causing deterioration of mechanical properties. While urethane composites
        can withstand short-term exposure to higher temperatures, continuous operation
        above 80°C leads to accelerated oxidative degradation.

        with rigid or semi-rigid polyurethanes and composites. For this class of materials,
        fracture toughness (K_IC) is typically in the range of 1-4 MPa·√m. The cited
        study on a polyurethane with a similar hardness reports a K_IC value of 2.5
        MPa·√m, which is a representative mid-range value for this material category.
