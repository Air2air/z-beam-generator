        research_basis: Urethane composites are not metals and therefore do not corrode
          via electrochemical oxidation. Their primary degradation in general environments
          is through hydrolysis, UV exposure, or chemical attack. Authoritative materials
          sources consistently rate polyurethanes as having "excellent" resistance
          to water, aqueous salts, and oxidation, which are the primary drivers of
          general environmental corrosion. Their main weakness is susceptibility to
          strong acids/bases and certain solvents, but this falls outside "general
          environmental" conditions. The rating reflects high performance against
          water, humidity, and salt air, with minor points deducted for potential
          long-term UV degradation if not specially formulated.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for polyurethane
          materials in air is consistently reported in the range of 80-90°C by material
          databases and technical datasheets. This temperature represents the upper
          limit before significant thermal degradation and oxidation processes begin,
          causing deterioration of mechanical properties. While urethane composites
          can withstand short-term exposure to higher temperatures, continuous operation
          above 80°C leads to accelerated oxidative degradation.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density 1.25 g/cm³, hardness 62.5
          Shore D) are characteristic of rigid, glassy polyurethanes. For this category
          of high-performance urethane composites, authoritative materials databases
          (AZoM, MatWeb) report flexural strength values typically ranging from 50
          MPa to 70 MPa. The cited value of 55 MPa is a representative median for
          rigid urethane composites tested under standard 3-point bend conditions
          (ASTM D790). The confidence is not higher due to the broad nature of the
          "Urethane Composites" category, where the specific formulation (e.g., fiber
          reinforcement, filler type) can significantly influence the final mechanical
          property.

          composites, which are known for high compressive strength. Authoritative
          materials databases consistently report compressive strength values for
          rigid urethanes in the range of 70-110 MPa, with 80 MPa being a typical
