  beforeText: Under microscopy, urethane composite surfaces reveal patchy contamination
    from fine particulates and oily films, causing pitting and micro-cracking that
    degrade aerospace structural integrity.
  afterText: The cleaned urethane composite surface restores to a smooth, contaminant-free
    finish, preserving full material integrity and original properties. This quality
    supports precise aerospace component fabrication.
