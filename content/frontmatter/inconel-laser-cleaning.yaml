caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Inconel surface shows heavy contamination by irregular
    oxide particles and embedded metallic debris. This buildup, it leads to pitting
    and rough degradation, weakening the alloy's protective layer.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the Inconel surface gleams with a pristine, uniform
    finish, free from oxides and residues. Restoration quality excels, fully preserving
    the alloy's high-strength integrity and corrosion resistance for reliable aerospace
    applications.

        research_basis: Inconel alloys (particularly Inconel 625 and 718) are nickel-chromium
          superalloys specifically designed for extreme corrosion resistance. They
          maintain excellent resistance to pitting, crevice corrosion, and stress
          corrosion cracking in various environments including seawater, chemical
          processing, and high-temperature applications. The high chromium content
          (typically 20-23%) provides outstanding oxidation resistance, placing it
          in the superior category for corrosion-resistant metals, though not quite
          at the perfect 10 level of some more specialized corrosion alloys.

          by specific grade and heat treatment. For the commonly referenced Inconel
          718 in the solution-annealed and aged condition, the room temperature K_IC
          typically falls in the range of 60-90 MPa·√m, with 70 MPa·√m being a representative
          mid-range value cited in multiple engineering references. Other Inconel
          grades (e.g., 625, 600) have different but generally comparable toughness
          values.
