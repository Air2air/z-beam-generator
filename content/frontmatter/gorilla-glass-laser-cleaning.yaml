    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1000.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Corning, the manufacturer, publishes a "typical compressive
        strength" value of 1.0 GPa (1000 MPa) for its Gorilla Glass product family
        in technical data sheets. This value is consistent with the high strength
        achieved through an ion-exchange process that creates a compressive stress
        layer on the surface.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Corning specifically engineers Gorilla Glass with high chemical
        durability, demonstrating exceptional resistance to acids, alkalis, and solvents
        in standardized tests (e.g., 24-hour exposure to 5% HCl results in minimal
        surface weight loss). This performance far exceeds standard soda-lime glass
        and is a key marketed feature for its use in harsh environments.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 900.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Corning's technical documentation for Gorilla Glass 5, which
        is chemically strengthened through an ion-exchange process, specifies a flexural
        strength of 900 MPa when tested using a ring-on-ring (biaxial flexure) method.
        This value is widely cited in industry literature and material databases as
        representative of the glass's bending strength. While the most common industrial
        test is ring-on-ring, the value is consistent with and comparable to results
        from standardized 4-point bend tests used for advanced ceramics and glasses.

      value: 6.75
      min: 3.5

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Corning does not explicitly list an "oxidation resistance temperature"
        for Gorilla Glass. However, the technical data sheet provides a "Maximum Continuous
        Service Temperature" of 600°C. This value represents the upper temperature
        limit for long-term use in air before significant property degradation, including
        oxidation-related effects on the glass surface and structure, would be expected
        to begin.

      value: 0.71

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness of Gorilla Glass is a well-documented
        material property provided by the manufacturer. Corning's technical documentation
        for Gorilla Glass 3 lists the K1C value as 0.71 MPa·√m. This value is consistent
        across multiple product generations and is cited in independent technical
        analyses of the material's mechanical performance.
