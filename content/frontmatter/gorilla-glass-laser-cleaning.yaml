  description: Microscopic analysis of Gorilla Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopic view, Gorilla Glass exhibits a contaminated surface
    dotted with fine particulate debris and oily smudges, forming uneven clusters
    that scatter light. These contaminants induce subtle pitting and haze, eroding
    the material's pristine optical performance vital for smartphone screens in everyday
    use.
  afterText: Following cleaning, the Gorilla Glass surface restores to a pristine,
    residue-free state with enhanced clarity and smoothness. Restoration quality excels,
    fully preserving material integrity without scratches or haze. In laser optics
    manufacturing, this ensures reliable beam transmission for high-precision applications.
