  beforeText: Under microscopic view, Gorilla Glass exhibits a contaminated surface
    dotted with fine particulate debris and oily smudges, forming uneven clusters
    that scatter light. These contaminants induce subtle pitting and haze, eroding
    the material's pristine optical performance vital for smartphone screens in everyday
    use.
  afterText: Following cleaning, the Gorilla Glass surface restores to a pristine,
    residue-free state with enhanced clarity and smoothness. Restoration quality excels,
    fully preserving material integrity without scratches or haze. In laser optics
    manufacturing, this ensures reliable beam transmission for high-precision applications.

          strength" value of 1.0 GPa (1000 MPa) for its Gorilla Glass product family
          in technical data sheets. This value is consistent with the high strength
          achieved through an ion-exchange process that creates a compressive stress
          layer on the surface.

          solvents in standardized tests (e.g., 24-hour exposure to 5% HCl results
          in minimal surface weight loss). This performance far exceeds standard soda-lime
          glass and is a key marketed feature for its use in harsh environments.

          flexural strength of 900 MPa when tested using a ring-on-ring (biaxial flexure)
          method. This value is widely cited in industry literature and material databases
          as representative of the glass's bending strength. While the most common
          industrial test is ring-on-ring, the value is consistent with and comparable
          to results from standardized 4-point bend tests used for advanced ceramics
          and glasses.
