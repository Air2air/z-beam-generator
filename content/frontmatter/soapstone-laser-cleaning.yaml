caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the soapstone surface appears very-very rough and
    uneven, covered by clustered fine dust particles, oily films, and stubborn mineral
    residues that cling tightly. Contaminants cause micro-pitting and faint scratches,
    so surface shows degradation with tiny cracks and discoloration spots forming,
    indicating wear from prolonged exposure.
  afterText: After cleaning, soapstone surface appears very-very smooth and clean-clean.
    Dirt is removed thoroughly then shine restored gently, so material integrity stays
    intact without scratches. Restoration quality high, looks like new and durable
    for daily use.

          stone typically range from approximately 70 MPa to over 110 MPa. The provided

          exceptional chemical inertness and acid resistance. ASTM standards classify
          serpentine/soapstone group stones as having high resistance to chemical
          weathering, with minimal deterioration from acid rain, industrial pollutants,
          and salt exposure compared to carbonates like marble or limestone. Its non-porous,
          dense nature prevents moisture penetration that drives corrosive processes
          in other dimension stones.
