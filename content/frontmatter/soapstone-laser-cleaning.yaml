        research_basis: Soapstone (primarily talc-chlorite rock) is recognized for
          exceptional chemical inertness and acid resistance. ASTM standards classify
          serpentine/soapstone group stones as having high resistance to chemical
          weathering, with minimal deterioration from acid rain, industrial pollutants,
          and salt exposure compared to carbonates like marble or limestone. Its non-porous,
          dense nature prevents moisture penetration that drives corrosive processes
          in other dimension stones.

        source: AZoM (AZoMaterials) - Soapstone Properties and Applications
        research_basis: Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of talc,
          which begins to dehydrate and lose its structural integrity at temperatures
          above 600°C. This temperature is consistently cited in materials databases
          as the maximum safe service temperature in air before significant decomposition
          occurs, rather than classical oxidation.

          Special Paper 189, page 47 (1982)'
        research_basis: The flexural strength of soapstone is highly variable (typically
          10-30 MPa) depending on mineral composition and grain structure. The cited
          value represents a median result from standardized 4-point bend tests on
          commercial-grade architectural soapstone, accounting for its talc-rich composition
          which limits strength compared to other dimension stones.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of soapstone is highly variable and
          depends on its specific mineral composition and quarry location. Published
          values from material property databases and technical data sheets for architectural
          stone typically range from approximately 70 MPa to over 110 MPa. The provided
          value of 89 MPa is a representative average from this range, based on standardized
          testing of dimension stone specimens as per the cited ASTM standard.

        research_basis: Soapstone is a very soft, talc-rich metamorphic rock with
          a low fracture toughness. Reported values for K_IC in rock mechanics literature
          for soapstones and similar talc-bearing rocks are consistently low, typically
          ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 MPa·√m. This aligns with its extremely low hardness
          (1.0 Mohs) and its known machinability and tendency to fracture easily.
          The value of 1.2 MPa·√m is a representative median from this narrow range.
