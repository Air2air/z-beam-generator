  description: Microscopic analysis of Soapstone surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the soapstone surface appears very-very rough and
    uneven, covered by clustered fine dust particles, oily films, and stubborn mineral
    residues that cling tightly. Contaminants cause micro-pitting and faint scratches,
    so surface shows degradation with tiny cracks and discoloration spots forming,
    indicating wear from prolonged exposure.
  afterText: After cleaning, soapstone surface appears very-very smooth and clean-clean.
    Dirt is removed thoroughly then shine restored gently, so material integrity stays
    intact without scratches. Restoration quality high, looks like new and durable
    for daily use.
