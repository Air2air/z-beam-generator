  description: Microscopic analysis of Sapphire Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, sapphire glass surface appears very-very contaminated
    with fine sticky particles and oily residues that cling and cover it tightly.
    This causes micro-scratches, pits, and dull degradation, reducing smoothness and
    clarity.
  afterText: Sapphire glass surface is cleaned thoroughly and appears very-very smooth.
    Restoration quality is high, preserving material integrity perfectly.
