      value: 2000.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of sapphire (single-crystal Al₂O₃)
        is highly dependent on crystal orientation, surface finish, and test method.
        The cited study and other technical reviews (e.g., from GT Advanced Technologies)
        report typical compressive strength values ranging from 1900 MPa to over 2900
        MPa for high-quality, flaw-free specimens. The value of 2000 MPa is a conservative,
        widely cited minimum for high-grade sapphire glass in an engineered state,
        tested under standard conditions (room temperature, polished surfaces to minimize
        stress concentrations).
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Sapphire glass (single crystal Al2O3) is chemically inert and
        highly resistant to environmental corrosion. It is insoluble in common acids
        and alkalis, and is unaffected by water, salt spray, and other environmental
        factors, with a Mohs hardness of 9 providing excellent resistance to abrasion,
        a form of mechanical "corrosion." Its primary vulnerability is to hydrofluoric
        acid and strong alkalis at high temperatures, preventing a perfect 10/10 score.

      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Sapphire (single-crystal Al2O3) has exceptional thermal stability.
        While it begins to show some surface decomposition/volatilization above ~1700°C
        in air, this temperature is widely cited in technical datasheets from optics
        and materials manufacturers as its maximum continuous service temperature
        in an oxidizing atmosphere before significant degradation.

      research_basis: Sapphire (single-crystal Al2O3) is an exceptionally strong glass-ceramic.
        Authoritative compilations of ceramic fracture toughness consistently report
        values for sapphire in the range of 2.0-2.4 MPa·√m for the most common crystallographic
        orientations at room temperature, with 2.0 MPa·√m being a widely cited and
        conservative benchmark.
