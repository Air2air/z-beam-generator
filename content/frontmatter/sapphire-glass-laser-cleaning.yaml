caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, sapphire glass surface appears very-very contaminated
    with fine sticky particles and oily residues that cling and cover it tightly.
    This causes micro-scratches, pits, and dull degradation, reducing smoothness and
    clarity.
  afterText: Sapphire glass surface is cleaned thoroughly and appears very-very smooth.
    Restoration quality is high, preserving material integrity perfectly.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of sapphire (single-crystal Al₂O₃)
          is highly dependent on crystal orientation, surface finish, and test method.
          The cited study and other technical reviews (e.g., from GT Advanced Technologies)
          report typical compressive strength values ranging from 1900 MPa to over
          2900 MPa for high-quality, flaw-free specimens. The value of 2000 MPa is
          a conservative, widely cited minimum for high-grade sapphire glass in an
          engineered state, tested under standard conditions (room temperature, polished
          surfaces to minimize stress concentrations).

        research_basis: Sapphire glass (single crystal Al2O3) is chemically inert
          and highly resistant to environmental corrosion. It is insoluble in common
          acids and alkalis, and is unaffected by water, salt spray, and other environmental
          factors, with a Mohs hardness of 9 providing excellent resistance to abrasion,
          a form of mechanical "corrosion." Its primary vulnerability is to hydrofluoric
          acid and strong alkalis at high temperatures, preventing a perfect 10/10
          score.
