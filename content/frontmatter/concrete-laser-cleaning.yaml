    corrosionResistance:

      unit: rating
      research_basis: Concrete provides excellent corrosion protection to embedded
        steel through its high alkalinity (pH ~13), creating a passive layer. While
        concrete itself is highly resistant to general environmental corrosion, the
        rating acknowledges potential deterioration mechanisms from chemical attacks
        (sulfates, chlorides) or carbonation that can compromise the protective environment
        over decades in harsh conditions. The 8/10 rating reflects concrete's superior
        performance in most atmospheric exposures compared to other masonry materials.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 4.1
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The ACI 318 code provides a direct empirical relationship for
        the modulus of rupture (flexural strength) of normal-weight concrete. For
        a compressive strength of 41.4 MPa (6000 psi), the formula `f_r = 0.62 * λ
        * √(f'_c)` (where λ=1 for normal-weight concrete and f'_c is in MPa) yields
        a flexural strength of approximately 4.0 MPa. This value aligns with typical
        industry data where flexural strength is generally 8-12% of the compressive
        strength for normal-strength concrete, placing the expected value for 41.4
        MPa concrete between 3.3 and 5.0 MPa. The cited 4.1 MPa is a well-established
        median value for this compressive strength range.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 300.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Concrete is a masonry/composite material whose high-temperature
        performance is governed by the degradation of its cement paste and the properties
        of its aggregate. Authoritative structural design codes like Eurocode 2 specify
        that for most normal-strength concrete, the maximum service temperature for
        sustained loading is approximately 300°C. Beyond this temperature, significant
        loss of compressive strength and chemical decomposition (e.g., dehydration
        of calcium silicate hydrates) begins, which is the functional equivalent of
        "significant oxidation" for this non-metallic material. The provided compressive
        strength of 41.4 MPa confirms this is normal-strength concrete, aligning with
        the code's scope.

    fractureToughness:

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 41.4 MPa is characteristic
        of high-strength concrete. For normal-strength concrete (20-40 MPa), K_IC
        typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 MPa·√m. For high-strength mixes like this,
        values are at the upper end of this range. Bažant's seminal work establishes
        that fracture toughness for concrete with a compressive strength of ~40 MPa
        is approximately 0.8 MPa·√m, correlating strongly with compressive strength
        and aggregate properties.
