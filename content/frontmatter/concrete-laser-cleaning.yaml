  beforeText: Microscopic inspection of the contaminated concrete surface reveals
    a porous matrix clogged with fine dust particles and oily residues from urban
    runoff. Contaminants include silica aggregates and hydrocarbon films, fostering
    micro-fissures and pitting that erode material cohesion. This degradation impacts
    longevity in construction site applications like sidewalk repairs.
  afterText: Following thorough cleaning, the concrete masonry surface restores to
    a smooth, even condition, upholding full material integrity for durable commercial
    flooring applications.

          steel through its high alkalinity (pH ~13), creating a passive layer. While
          concrete itself is highly resistant to general environmental corrosion,
          the rating acknowledges potential deterioration mechanisms from chemical
          attacks (sulfates, chlorides) or carbonation that can compromise the protective
          environment over decades in harsh conditions. The 8/10 rating reflects concrete's
          superior performance in most atmospheric exposures compared to other masonry
          materials.

        research_basis: The ACI 318 code provides a direct empirical relationship
          for the modulus of rupture (flexural strength) of normal-weight concrete.
          For a compressive strength of 41.4 MPa (6000 psi), the formula `f_r = 0.62
          * λ * √(f'_c)` (where λ=1 for normal-weight concrete and f'_c is in MPa)
          yields a flexural strength of approximately 4.0 MPa. This value aligns with
          typical industry data where flexural strength is generally 8-12% of the
          compressive strength for normal-strength concrete, placing the expected
          value for 41.4 MPa concrete between 3.3 and 5.0 MPa. The cited 4.1 MPa is
          a well-established median value for this compressive strength range.

        research_basis: Concrete is a masonry/composite material whose high-temperature
          performance is governed by the degradation of its cement paste and the properties
          of its aggregate. Authoritative structural design codes like Eurocode 2
          specify that for most normal-strength concrete, the maximum service temperature
          for sustained loading is approximately 300°C. Beyond this temperature, significant
          loss of compressive strength and chemical decomposition (e.g., dehydration
          of calcium silicate hydrates) begins, which is the functional equivalent
          of "significant oxidation" for this non-metallic material. The provided
          compressive strength of 41.4 MPa confirms this is normal-strength concrete,
          aligning with the code's scope.

        research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 41.4 MPa is characteristic
          of high-strength concrete. For normal-strength concrete (20-40 MPa), K_IC
          typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 MPa·√m. For high-strength mixes like this,
          values are at the upper end of this range. Bažant's seminal work establishes
          that fracture toughness for concrete with a compressive strength of ~40
          MPa is approximately 0.8 MPa·√m, correlating strongly with compressive strength
          and aggregate properties.
