caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the quartzite surface shows fine dust particles and
    oily residues, with minor pitting degradation.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the quartzite surface regains its fresh, natural
    look. Dirt and grime lift away, leaving a smooth texture and vibrant colors intact.
    This process demonstrates effective restoration without any damage to the stone's
    hard structure. The material holds its strength and durability, showing no cracks
    or weakening. Now, it's ready for everyday use in homes or outdoors, preserving
    quartzite's timeless quality.

        research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock known for high compressive
          strength, typically ranging from 150 MPa to over 300 MPa. The value of 200
          MPa represents a common average for commercial quartzite used in construction
          aggregates, as reported in materials testing standards and industry publications.
          However, the exact strength can vary significantly based on mineral composition,
          grain size, and foliation.

        research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz,
          one of the most chemically stable and durable minerals. It is highly resistant
          to environmental corrosion from water, oxidation, and acidic atmospheres,
          performing similarly to granite. The ASTM standard rates quartzite's durability
          and weather resistance as "generally acceptable" for exterior applications,
          placing it in the highest tier of natural stone for corrosion/weathering
          resistance.

        research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz
          (SiO2). Its high-temperature limit in air is governed by the phase transition
          of quartz from beta to alpha cristobalite, which begins around 870°C. This
          transformation is accompanied by a significant volume change, causing mechanical
          degradation and loss of structural integrity, which is the primary failure
          mode in an oxidizing (air) atmosphere. This temperature is consistently
          cited in industrial and refractory material guides for quartz and quartzite.
