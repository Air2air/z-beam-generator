  description: Microscopic analysis of Quartzite surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the quartzite surface shows fine dust particles and
    oily residues, with minor pitting degradation.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the quartzite surface regains its fresh, natural
    look. Dirt and grime lift away, leaving a smooth texture and vibrant colors intact.
    This process demonstrates effective restoration without any damage to the stone's
    hard structure. The material holds its strength and durability, showing no cracks
    or weakening. Now, it's ready for everyday use in homes or outdoors, preserving
    quartzite's timeless quality.
