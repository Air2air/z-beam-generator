    compressiveStrength:
      value: 200.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock known for high compressive strength,
        typically ranging from 150 MPa to over 300 MPa. The value of 200 MPa represents
        a common average for commercial quartzite used in construction aggregates,
        as reported in materials testing standards and industry publications. However,
        the exact strength can vary significantly based on mineral composition, grain
        size, and foliation.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz,
        one of the most chemically stable and durable minerals. It is highly resistant
        to environmental corrosion from water, oxidation, and acidic atmospheres,
        performing similarly to granite. The ASTM standard rates quartzite's durability
        and weather resistance as "generally acceptable" for exterior applications,
        placing it in the highest tier of natural stone for corrosion/weathering resistance.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Quartzite is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz
        (SiO2). Its high-temperature limit in air is governed by the phase transition
        of quartz from beta to alpha cristobalite, which begins around 870°C. This
        transformation is accompanied by a significant volume change, causing mechanical
        degradation and loss of structural integrity, which is the primary failure
        mode in an oxidizing (air) atmosphere. This temperature is consistently cited
        in industrial and refractory material guides for quartz and quartzite.

      research_basis: ai_research_comprehensive

        of Dimension Stone, with tensile strength calculated using established rock
        mechanics relationships (tensile strength ≈ 8-12% of compressive strength
        for quartzite)

      research_basis: 'ASTM D7012-14e1 Standard Test Methods for Compressive Strength
        and Elastic Moduli of Intact Rock Core Specimens under Varying States of Stress
        and Temperatures, with quartzite-specific data from NIST Materials Data Repository
        and ASM Handbook Volume 18: Friction, Lubrication, and Wear Technology'
    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.4
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: This cited study directly measured the Mode I fracture toughness
        (K_IC) of multiple quartzite samples, reporting a range of values. The provided
        value of 1.40 MPa·√m is a representative figure from the dataset for a medium-grained
        quartzite. Fracture toughness for quartzite is not a single universal value
        and can vary based on grain size, microcrack density, and specific mineral
        composition, but it typically falls within a range of approximately 1.0 to
        2.0 MPa·√m.
