    compressiveStrength:
      value: 150.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of calcite is highly dependent on test
        conditions, particularly confining pressure and sample porosity. The cited
        value of 150 MPa is a representative upper-bound strength for relatively intact,
        low-porosity calcite tested under standard uniaxial compressive strength (UCS)
        conditions at room temperature. However, literature values show significant
        variation, ranging from below 50 MPa for porous or weak samples to over 200
        MPa for very dense, crystalline calcite.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Calcite (calcium carbonate) is highly reactive with even weak
        acids, including those found in acid rain and soil environments. Its low hardness
        (3 Mohs) makes it highly susceptible to mechanical weathering and dissolution.
        While stable in alkaline conditions, its poor performance in common corrosive
        environments (urban, industrial, marine) results in a low overall corrosion
        resistance rating.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 10.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Flexural strength for calcite is not a commonly reported property
        in general material databases, as it is more often characterized by its compressive
        strength for geological applications. However, authoritative experimental
        rock mechanics texts like Paterson & Wong report a "bending strength" for
        Carrara marble (a well-known, nearly pure calcite rock) of approximately 10
        MPa. This value is derived from standard 3-point bend tests on rock cores.
        The confidence is high because the source is a foundational rock mechanics
        reference, but it is not 1.00 because the value is for a specific calcite
        marble rather than a universal property of all calcite crystals.

      research_basis: 'Calcite (CaCO₃) does not oxidize; it decomposes. The primary
        high-temperature reaction is calcination: CaCO₃ -> CaO + CO₂. This decomposition
        begins significantly around 525°C in air at atmospheric pressure, which is
        the functional equivalent of its "oxidation resistance temperature" as it
        defines its maximum useful service temperature in an oxidative environment.
        This temperature is well-documented in geological and materials science literature
        for calcium carbonate.'

      research_basis: The fracture toughness of calcite, as a single crystal or the
        primary mineral in limestone/marble, is consistently reported in geomechanics
        literature as being very low, typically in the range of 0.2-0.4 MPa·√m. The
        value of 0.30 MPa·√m is a commonly cited median value from compilations of
        experimental data on geological materials, reflecting its perfect rhombohedral
        cleavage which makes it prone to brittle fracture.
