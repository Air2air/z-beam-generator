        research_basis: Calcite (calcium carbonate) is highly reactive with even weak
          acids, including those found in acid rain and soil environments. Its low
          hardness (3 Mohs) makes it highly susceptible to mechanical weathering and
          dissolution. While stable in alkaline conditions, its poor performance in
          common corrosive environments (urban, industrial, marine) results in a low
          overall corrosion resistance rating.

        research_basis: 'Calcite (CaCO₃) does not oxidize; it decomposes. The primary
          high-temperature reaction is calcination: CaCO₃ -> CaO + CO₂. This decomposition
          begins significantly around 525°C in air at atmospheric pressure, which
          is the functional equivalent of its "oxidation resistance temperature" as
          it defines its maximum useful service temperature in an oxidative environment.
          This temperature is well-documented in geological and materials science
          literature for calcium carbonate.'

          Brittle Field," Springer, 2005, p. 89 (Table 5.1).
        research_basis: Flexural strength for calcite is not a commonly reported property
          in general material databases, as it is more often characterized by its
          compressive strength for geological applications. However, authoritative
          experimental rock mechanics texts like Paterson & Wong report a "bending
          strength" for Carrara marble (a well-known, nearly pure calcite rock) of
          approximately 10 MPa. This value is derived from standard 3-point bend tests
          on rock cores. The confidence is high because the source is a foundational
          rock mechanics reference, but it is not 1.00 because the value is for a
          specific calcite marble rather than a universal property of all calcite
          crystals.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of calcite is highly dependent on
          test conditions, particularly confining pressure and sample porosity. The
          cited value of 150 MPa is a representative upper-bound strength for relatively
          intact, low-porosity calcite tested under standard uniaxial compressive
          strength (UCS) conditions at room temperature. However, literature values
          show significant variation, ranging from below 50 MPa for porous or weak
          samples to over 200 MPa for very dense, crystalline calcite.
