          Corrosion Resistance of Beryllium)'
        research_basis: Beryllium exhibits excellent resistance to atmospheric corrosion
          due to the formation of a protective, adherent oxide film (BeO). It has
          good resistance to high-purity water and many industrial environments. However,
          its corrosion resistance is highly dependent on purity and specific environments;
          it can be attacked by acids, halogens, and strong alkalis, but performs
          very well in general atmospheric conditions.

          and Special-Purpose Materials (ASM International, 1990), page 805.'
        research_basis: Beryllium has poor oxidation resistance in air. While a thin
          protective BeO film forms, it becomes non-protective and breaks down at
          elevated temperatures. The ASM Handbook states that for continuous service
          in air, temperatures are limited to approximately 600°C (1112°F) due to
          rapid oxidation above this point. Significant oxidation begins at lower
          temperatures (~500°C), but 600°C is the established maximum service limit
          for sustained exposure.

          Data
        research_basis: The provided flexural strength value is for hot-pressed beryllium,
          which is the most common structural form. Beryllium is a brittle metal,
          and its flexural strength is a critical design property, typically determined
          by 4-point bend testing. The value falls within the 250-450 MPa range commonly
          reported for high-purity, hot-pressed block material in authoritative materials
          databases.

        source: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 2, "Properties and Selection: Nonferrous Alloys
          and Special-Purpose Materials" (10th Edition)'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of beryllium is significantly higher
          than its tensile strength (which is typically 240-380 MPa). The value of
          600 MPa is a representative compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) for
          hot-pressed beryllium block, a common industrial form. The high stiffness-to-weight
          ratio and hexagonal crystal structure of beryllium contribute to its anisotropic
          mechanical properties, where compressive strength is a key design parameter.
