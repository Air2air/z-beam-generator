caption:
  beforeText: Microscopic examination of the contaminated beryllium surface reveals
    irregular patches of adhered contaminants. Fine dust particles, oily residues,
    and oxide films cover the metal, creating a rough texture and dull appearance.
    This buildup causes surface degradation, with visible pits and microcracks that
    weaken integrity. And for cleaning applications, prompt removal is key to restore
    smoothness.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the beryllium surface looks smooth and free of
    contaminants like oxides and residues. This restoration demonstrates good quality,
    maintaining the metal's integrity without any thermal distortion. The lightweight
    material keeps its strength and stiffness, ready for general applications in tools
    and components.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of beryllium is significantly higher
          than its tensile strength (which is typically 240-380 MPa). The value of
          600 MPa is a representative compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) for
          hot-pressed beryllium block, a common industrial form. The high stiffness-to-weight
          ratio and hexagonal crystal structure of beryllium contribute to its anisotropic
          mechanical properties, where compressive strength is a key design parameter.

          good resistance to high-purity water and many industrial environments. However,

          it can be attacked by acids, halogens, and strong alkalis, but performs
          very well in general atmospheric conditions.

          protective BeO film forms, it becomes non-protective and breaks down at
          elevated temperatures. The ASM Handbook states that for continuous service
          in air, temperatures are limited to approximately 600°C (1112°F) due to
          rapid oxidation above this point. Significant oxidation begins at lower
          temperatures (~500°C), but 600°C is the established maximum service limit
          for sustained exposure.
