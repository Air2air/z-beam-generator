    compressiveStrength:
      value: 38.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties, lists the compressive strength of Poplar (specifically Yellow Poplar, Liriodendron tulipifera) as 5,540 psi parallel to grain, which converts to 38.2 MPa. This value represents the crushing strength measured in accordance with ASTM D143 standard test methods for small clear specimens at 12% moisture content.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Poplar is a non-durable hardwood with very low natural decay resistance. The USDA Wood Handbook classifies it as perishable (service life <5 years in ground contact), placing it in the lowest durability category for North American hardwoods. It lacks protective extractives and is highly susceptible to fungal decay, insects, and moisture damage without preservative treatment.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 59.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook is a primary reference for wood properties. For poplar (specifically yellow-poplar, *Liriodendron tulipifera*), the modulus of rupture (MOR), which is the standard measure of flexural/bending strength, is listed as 59.0 MPa at 12% moisture content, based on standardized 3-point bend testing of small, clear specimens. This value is consistent with the known low density and hardness of poplar.
    hardness:
      value: 2.4
      min: 1
      max: 5000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material. Chapter 4: Mechanical Properties of Wood. Table 4-3: Hardness of commercial woods.'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood is not defined by a single chemical transition but by the onset of pyrolysis and oxidative degradation. Authoritative sources like the FPL Wood Handbook and engineering material databases (e.g., CES EduPack) consistently report that significant thermal decomposition for most wood species, including poplar, begins around 200-250°C. The lower end of this range (200°C) is cited as the maximum safe long-term service temperature in air to avoid significant loss of mechanical properties and mass due to oxidation. Poplar, being a hardwood with typical lignocellulosic composition, fits within this general behavior.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided source lists fracture toughness values for various woods, including poplar, measured using standard fracture mechanics tests. The value of 0.35 MPa·√m is characteristic for poplar wood in the transverse (perpendicular to grain) direction, which is the typical mode of failure and reporting for this property in wood science.
