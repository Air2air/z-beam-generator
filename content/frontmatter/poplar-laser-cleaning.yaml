  beforeText: Under microscopy, Poplar wood's surface reveals clustered dirt particles
    and oily smears, eroding fibers and causing micro-pitting. This degradation hinders
    effective cleaning in woodworking applications.
  afterText: Upon completing the cleaning process, the poplar wood surface displays
    a thoroughly restored condition, characterized by its smooth finish, vibrant natural
    color, and intact grain structure, devoid of any contaminants. The restoration
    quality proves exceptional, preserving complete material integrity and preventing
    any potential weakening. This is particularly valuable in applications for crafting
    durable laser optic mounts in the industry.

          treatment.

          For poplar (specifically yellow-poplar, *Liriodendron tulipifera*), the
          modulus of rupture (MOR), which is the standard measure of flexural/bending
          strength, is listed as 59.0 MPa at 12% moisture content, based on standardized
          3-point bend testing of small, clear specimens. This value is consistent
          with the known low density and hardness of poplar.

        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood is not
          defined by a single chemical transition but by the onset of pyrolysis and
          oxidative degradation. Authoritative sources like the FPL Wood Handbook
          and engineering material databases (e.g., CES EduPack) consistently report
          that significant thermal decomposition for most wood species, including
          poplar, begins around 200-250°C. The lower end of this range (200°C) is
          cited as the maximum safe long-term service temperature in air to avoid
          significant loss of mechanical properties and mass due to oxidation. Poplar,
          being a hardwood with typical lignocellulosic composition, fits within this
          general behavior.
