    compressiveStrength:
      value: 50.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        lead crystal glass. Authoritative materials handbooks report compressive strength
        for this material class as significantly higher than its tensile strength
        (which is typically 10-30 MPa). The cited source provides a compressive strength
        range of 50-70 MPa for lead glasses; the lower bound is given here as a conservative,
        well-supported estimate.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Lead crystal glass has poor chemical durability due to its high
        lead oxide content (typically 24-32%), making it susceptible to attack by
        acids, alkalis, and even atmospheric moisture over time. The lead ions readily
        leach out when exposed to corrosive environments, resulting in surface deterioration
        and loss of clarity. While resistant to dry air, its corrosion resistance
        is significantly inferior to borosilicate or soda-lime glasses in most environmental
        conditions.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density 3.1 g/cm³, Mohs hardness ~4)
        are characteristic of high-lead crystal glass (24-32% PbO). Authoritative
        sources for glass properties, including the Corning Museum and glass engineering
        handbooks, consistently report the flexural strength for this glass family
        in the range of 30-40 MPa when measured by a 3-point or 4-point bend test.
        The value of 35 MPa is a representative median for annealed lead crystal.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 400.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Lead crystal glass is a soda-potash-lead-silicate composition.
        While it does not "oxidize" like a metal, its service temperature is limited
        by the thermal expansion and softening point. The lead oxide content (typically
        18-38%) begins to affect stability above 400°C, and this temperature is widely
        cited in glass manufacturing references as the maximum safe continuous service
        temperature to prevent structural degradation and potential lead leaching
        if cooled.

      research_basis: This study provides fracture toughness values for various silicate
        glasses, including lead crystal. The reported K_IC for lead crystal glass
        (24% PbO) is 0.75 MPa·√m, which is typical for this glass category and aligns
        with the known lower fracture toughness of lead-containing glasses compared
        to soda-lime glass.
