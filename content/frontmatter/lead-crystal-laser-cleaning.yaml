caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the lead crystal surface reveals scattered dust
    particles and oily smudges clinging tightly. These contaminants etch micro-pits
    into the glass, dulling its clarity and promoting further degradation over time.
    This condition hinders effective cleaning for everyday use.
  afterText: The laser cleaning of lead crystal restores the surface to a smooth,
    lustrous finish, free from residues and minor scratches. This condition shows
    high restoration quality, as the glass regains its original clarity and sparkle.
    Material integrity remains intact, with no thermal distortion or refractive changes.
    The process gently removes contaminants and preserves the delicate structure for
    everyday decorative use.

          high lead oxide content (typically 24-32%), making it susceptible to attack
          by acids, alkalis, and even atmospheric moisture over time. The lead ions
          readily leach out when exposed to corrosive environments, resulting in surface
          deterioration and loss of clarity. While resistant to dry air, its corrosion
          resistance is significantly inferior to borosilicate or soda-lime glasses
          in most environmental conditions.

          While it does not "oxidize" like a metal, its service temperature is limited
          by the thermal expansion and softening point. The lead oxide content (typically
          18-38%) begins to affect stability above 400°C, and this temperature is
          widely cited in glass manufacturing references as the maximum safe continuous
          service temperature to prevent structural degradation and potential lead
          leaching if cooled.
