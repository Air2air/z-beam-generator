  description: Microscopic analysis of Lead Crystal surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the lead crystal surface reveals scattered dust
    particles and oily smudges clinging tightly. These contaminants etch micro-pits
    into the glass, dulling its clarity and promoting further degradation over time.
    This condition hinders effective cleaning for everyday use.
  afterText: The laser cleaning of lead crystal restores the surface to a smooth,
    lustrous finish, free from residues and minor scratches. This condition shows
    high restoration quality, as the glass regains its original clarity and sparkle.
    Material integrity remains intact, with no thermal distortion or refractive changes.
    The process gently removes contaminants and preserves the delicate structure for
    everyday decorative use.
