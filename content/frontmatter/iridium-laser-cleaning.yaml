caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the iridium surface displays clustered contaminants
    like fine dust particles and residual oils from manufacturing handling. These
    irregular deposits, measuring 5-15 microns with rough textures, form patchy films
    that obscure the metal's inherent smoothness. Surface degradation appears as subtle
    micro-pits and hazy oxidation layers, compromising reflectivity in laser optics
    for semiconductor fabrication.
  afterText: After cleaning, the iridium surface restores to a smooth, highly reflective
    finish, preserving full material integrity without pitting or oxidation. This
    quality supports reliable performance in laser optic coatings for precision systems.

          characteristic of a very strong, refractory metal. Iridium is known for
          its high strength and compressive yield strength at room temperature is
          typically cited in the range of 1-2 GPa (1000-2000 MPa). The value of 2000
          MPa is a representative upper-bound estimate for high-purity, annealed iridium,
          based on authoritative materials handbooks. However, the exact value is
          highly dependent on purity, grain size, and thermomechanical processing
          history, which is not specified in the query.
