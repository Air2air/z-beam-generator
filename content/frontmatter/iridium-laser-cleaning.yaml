          virtually unattacked by all mineral acids including aqua regia, and resistant
          to molten metals like silver, gold, and bismuth. Its primary limitation
          is oxidation at high temperatures (above 600°C), but it maintains excellent
          stability in general environmental conditions, ranking among the most corrosion-resistant
          metals.

        research_basis: Iridium has excellent oxidation resistance up to approximately
          1100°C in air, forming a thin, protective layer of IrO₂. Above this temperature,
          the oxide layer becomes volatile (forming IrO₃), leading to significant
          and catastrophic oxidative erosion, which is a well-documented limitation
          for its high-temperature use in air.

        research_basis: The provided value of 690 MPa (100 ksi) is the typical flexural
          strength for pure, recrystallized iridium at room temperature, as reported
          in a major materials handbook. This property is highly dependent on the
          material's purity and thermomechanical processing (e.g., grain size, work
          hardening). For high-purity, annealed iridium, values are generally in this
          range, while strength can be significantly higher for fine-grained or worked
          material.

        research_basis: The provided properties (high hardness, high density) are
          characteristic of a very strong, refractory metal. Iridium is known for
          its high strength and compressive yield strength at room temperature is
          typically cited in the range of 1-2 GPa (1000-2000 MPa). The value of 2000
          MPa is a representative upper-bound estimate for high-purity, annealed iridium,
          based on authoritative materials handbooks. However, the exact value is
          highly dependent on purity, grain size, and thermomechanical processing
          history, which is not specified in the query.
