caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, PTFE surface appears very-very rough with oily contaminants
    stuck and degradation spots visible.
  afterText: The ultrafast laser cleaning process removes contaminants very-very effectively
    from polytetrafluoroethylene surfaces, then restores smoothness and integrity.
    The cleaned surface appears pristine and glossy, with no damage to the plastic's
    chemical structure or mechanical properties. Restoration quality is high-high,
    preserving hydrophobicity and durability for general applications, so the material
    remains fully functional and reliable.

          databases and standards. MatWeb, a widely recognized database, lists a typical
          compressive strength of 12.5 MPa for unfilled PTFE when tested according
          to ASTM D695, the standard test method for compressive properties of rigid
          plastics. This value is consistent with PTFE's known soft, ductile nature
          compared to other engineering plastics.
