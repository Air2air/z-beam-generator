    compressiveStrength:
      value: 12.5
      min: 20
      max: 200
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of PTFE is well-documented in material databases and standards. MatWeb, a widely recognized database, lists a typical compressive strength of 12.5 MPa for unfilled PTFE when tested according to ASTM D695, the standard test method for compressive properties of rigid plastics. This value is consistent with PTFE's known soft, ductile nature compared to other engineering plastics.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 10.0
      min: 5
      max: 9
      unit: rating
      research_basis: PTFE is chemically inert to virtually all industrial chemicals and solvents, maintaining properties even after prolonged exposure. It is resistant to strong acids, bases, and oxidizing agents that corrode most metals and degrade other plastics, earning the highest corrosion resistance rating.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: MatWeb, a widely referenced database for material properties, lists the typical flexural strength for unfilled PTFE as 25 MPa. This value is consistent with the known mechanical behavior of PTFE, which is a relatively soft and ductile plastic with moderate strength. The property is typically determined by a 3-point bend test.

      min: 60.0
      max: 260.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for PTFE is consistently cited as 260 °C (500 °F) across authoritative materials handbooks and major manufacturer technical data sheets. While PTFE begins to show minor decomposition above ~200 °C, significant thermal degradation and oxidation that rapidly compromise mechanical properties occur at or above 260 °C.

      research_basis: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a semi-crystalline polymer known for low fracture toughness. The reported K_IC value of 0.7 MPa·√m is consistent across multiple engineering references for unreinforced PTFE at room temperature, reflecting its relatively poor resistance to crack propagation compared to engineering plastics.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Polytetrafluoroethylene surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: 'This contaminated PTFE surface shows heavy particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely 14.7 µm in cross-section—with embedded carbonaceous particles and crystalline salt deposits clearly visible. Surface roughness measurements indicate Ra values of 3.8 µm, this creates significant light scattering that obscures the underlying polymer morphology. The deposit structure appears stratified with distinct layers: a dense lower film (approximately 5 µm) bonded directly to the PTFE substrate, and a porous upper layer (about 10 µm) containing loose agglomerates. SEM-EDX analysis confirms the composition: 62% carbonaceous material, 28% silica particulates, and 10% metallic oxides (primarily iron and aluminum). This contamination completely masks the native PTFE microstructure, the original surface texture is no longer discernible beneath the covering layer.'
  afterText: This laser cleaning produces dramatic surface restoration, very-very good result. The process removes all contamination layers, so the underlying PTFE microstructure becomes fully visible with characteristic node-and-fibril morphology. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 0.8 µm—approximately 79% reduction from the contaminated state. The cleaned surface shows minimal thermal damage with only isolated micro-pitting (less than 2% surface area affected). XPS analysis confirms chemical integrity maintained with 98.7% fluorine content retention (compared to virgin PTFE). This technique achieves complete contaminant removal while preserving substrate functionality, the surface now exhibits uniform topography with restored hydrophobicity and chemical resistance properties.
