    compressiveStrength:
      value: 12.5
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of PTFE is well-documented in material
        databases and standards. MatWeb, a widely recognized database, lists a typical
        compressive strength of 12.5 MPa for unfilled PTFE when tested according to
        ASTM D695, the standard test method for compressive properties of rigid plastics.
        This value is consistent with PTFE's known soft, ductile nature compared to
        other engineering plastics.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 10.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: PTFE is chemically inert to virtually all industrial chemicals
        and solvents, maintaining properties even after prolonged exposure. It is
        resistant to strong acids, bases, and oxidizing agents that corrode most metals
        and degrade other plastics, earning the highest corrosion resistance rating.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: MatWeb, a widely referenced database for material properties,
        lists the typical flexural strength for unfilled PTFE as 25 MPa. This value
        is consistent with the known mechanical behavior of PTFE, which is a relatively
        soft and ductile plastic with moderate strength. The property is typically
        determined by a 3-point bend test.

        consistently cited as 260 °C (500 °F) across authoritative materials handbooks
        and major manufacturer technical data sheets. While PTFE begins to show minor
        decomposition above ~200 °C, significant thermal degradation and oxidation
        that rapidly compromise mechanical properties occur at or above 260 °C.

      research_basis: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a semi-crystalline polymer
        known for low fracture toughness. The reported K_IC value of 0.7 MPa·√m is
        consistent across multiple engineering references for unreinforced PTFE at
        room temperature, reflecting its relatively poor resistance to crack propagation
        compared to engineering plastics.
