    surfaces, then restores smoothness and integrity. The cleaned surface appears pristine and glossy, with no damage to the
    plastic's chemical structure or mechanical properties. Restoration quality is high-high, preserving hydrophobicity and
    durability for general applications, so the material remains fully functional and reliable.

faq:
- question: Can laser cleaning safely remove contaminants from PTFE surfaces without damaging the material?
  answer: With PTFE's low surface energy and thermal sensitivity, we maintain 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 500 mm/s scan speed for
    safe contaminant removal. This prevents ablation or discoloration by leveraging nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength,
    which the material absorbs effectively without subsurface damage.
- question: What laser wavelength and parameters are optimal for cleaning PTFE versus other plastics?
  answer: For PTFE's unique absorption profile, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength with 5.1 J/cm² fluence. This near-infrared
    setting, using 50 µm spot size and 100 W average power, provides optimal contaminant removal while preventing the thermal
    degradation common in other polymers like polyethylene.
- question: Does laser cleaning PTFE create hazardous fumes or nanoparticles, and what extraction is required?
  answer: Laser cleaning PTFE at 5.1 J/cm² fluence generates hazardous PFAS compounds and HF gas. OSHA mandates robust fume
    extraction with HEPA/ULPA filtration for nanoparticles and acid gas scrubbers to capture toxic byproducts, requiring negative-pressure
    enclosures for operator safety.
- question: How does laser cleaning affect the surface energy of PTFE for subsequent adhesion or coating?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² significantly increases PTFE's surface energy by creating microstructures and removing
    fluorine. This enhances wettability for superior coating adhesion, outperforming chemical methods with precise, non-thermal
    1064 nm processing.
- question: Can laser cleaning restore the non-stick properties of contaminated PTFE components?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 5.1 J/cm² fluence effectively removes baked-on contaminants from PTFE. This process restores the
    original low surface energy, reinstating non-stick performance without thermal degradation when using appropriate 1064
    nm wavelength and 50% beam overlap.
- question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for PTFE with embedded contaminants or deep penetration?
  answer: PTFE's porous structure presents challenges for deep contamination removal, as our optimal 5.1 J/cm² fluence primarily
    addresses surface layers. Subsurface contaminants often require multiple passes, which risks thermal accumulation and
    potential material modification beyond the intended treatment zone.
- question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sandblasting, chemical cleaning) for PTFE maintenance?
  answer: Laser cleaning surpasses traditional methods by preserving PTFE's integrity with precise 5.1 J/cm² fluence and 50
    μm spot size. It eliminates chemical waste and abrasive media, offering a safer, non-contact solution that maintains the
    low-friction surface critical for aerospace and medical applications.
- question: What visual indicators distinguish proper laser cleaning from damage on PTFE surfaces?
  answer: Proper cleaning preserves PTFE's white hue and smooth texture. Thermal damage appears as browning or yellowing at
    fluences exceeding ~5 J/cm², indicating polymer degradation. Optimal 1064 nm wavelength ablation removes contaminants
    without altering the substrate's inherent properties.
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for medical-grade PTFE implants or devices during refurbishment?
  answer: Laser cleaning can sterilize medical PTFE implants when using 1064 nm wavelength at 5.1 J/cm² fluence. This effectively
    ablates contaminants while preserving the polymer's structural integrity. However, post-process validation for surface
    chemistry and regulatory compliance is mandatory for refurbished medical devices.
- question: How does the high thermal expansion coefficient of PTFE affect laser cleaning process stability?
  answer: PTFE's high thermal expansion coefficient of ~135×10⁻⁶/°C necessitates careful thermal stress management during
    laser cleaning. We maintain process stability by using a 50 kHz repetition rate and 500 mm/s scan speed to minimize localized
    heating, which prevents the dimensional distortion and warping common in this polymer. This ensures uniform material removal
    without compromising the substrate's integrity.
