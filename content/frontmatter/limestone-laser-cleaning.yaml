        research_basis: Limestone is a calcium carbonate-based rock highly susceptible
          to chemical weathering from acidic environments (acid rain, urban pollution).
          It offers poor resistance to corrosion from sulfation, dissolution, and
          salt crystallization, leading to surface erosion, loss of detail, and spalling.
          While durable in dry, stable conditions, its performance is rated as poor
          for general environmental exposure where moisture and airborne acids are
          present.

          constant like compressive strength but falls within a typical range. ASTM
          C880 provides the standard testing method for dimension stone. Data from
          the Natural Stone Institute and other technical sources (e.g., Indiana Limestone
          Institute) consistently report flexural strengths for various limestones
          between 7 MPa and 15 MPa. The value of 10.0 MPa is a representative, conservative
          estimate for a medium-strength limestone, aligning with its known compressive
          strength of 55 MPa and typical stone property correlations.

          is strongly correlated with its compressive strength and porosity. For limestones
