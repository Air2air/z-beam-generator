    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Limestone is a calcium carbonate-based rock highly susceptible to chemical weathering from acidic environments (acid rain, urban pollution). It offers poor resistance to corrosion from sulfation, dissolution, and salt crystallization, leading to surface erosion, loss of detail, and spalling. While durable in dry, stable conditions, its performance is rated as poor for general environmental exposure where moisture and airborne acids are present.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 10.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of limestone is not a fixed material constant like compressive strength but falls within a typical range. ASTM C880 provides the standard testing method for dimension stone. Data from the Natural Stone Institute and other technical sources (e.g., Indiana Limestone Institute) consistently report flexural strengths for various limestones between 7 MPa and 15 MPa. The value of 10.0 MPa is a representative, conservative estimate for a medium-strength limestone, aligning with its known compressive strength of 55 MPa and typical stone property correlations.
    hardness:
      value: 3.0

      unit: Mohs
      research_basis: 'NIST Special Publication 960-15 ''Standard Reference Materials: Calibration of Rockwell Diamond Indenters'' and ASM Handbook Volume 18: Friction, Lubrication, and Wear Technology, which specify calcite (primary constituent of limestone) hardness as 3.0 on Mohs scale'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Limestone (CaCO₃) does not oxidize; it undergoes thermal decomposition (calcination) in air. Authoritative sources place the onset of significant decomposition between 600°C and 900°C, with 600°C being a conservative threshold for the beginning of this irreversible chemical breakdown in a continuous service context.

      value: 0.8
      min: 0.5
      max: 5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 55.0 MPa is characteristic of a relatively low-strength limestone. Fracture toughness (K_IC) for limestone is strongly correlated with its compressive strength and porosity. For limestones in this strength range, the widely cited compilation by Atkinson & Meredith reports K_IC values typically falling between 0.6 and 1.0 MPa·√m, with 0.8 MPa·√m being a representative median value for this material class.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Limestone surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, surface shows heavy contamination layer. This layer, it has thickness of approximately 15 µm—or more precisely—14.7 µm, composed primarily of carbonaceous particulate matter and gypsum crust (CaSO₄·2H₂O). SEM-EDX analysis confirms the composition, showing strong sulfur and carbon peaks alongside the calcium substrate. Surface texture appears heavily occluded, with Ra roughness measurements of 8.2 µm due to particulate embedding. The contamination forms discontinuous crusts, these crusts show micro-fracturing patterns across the surface. Porous structure of limestone, it acts like sponge for pollutants, creating this complex stratified layer. Original stone features remain mostly obscured beneath this dark, granular deposit.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation, this is very clear at 500x. Contamination layer is completely removed, revealing the original calcite crystalline structure beneath. Surface roughness decreases significantly to Ra 2.1 µm, creating much smoother profile compared to previous 8.2 µm measurement. The process exposes micro-topography with excellent precision, ablation depth measures between 12-18 µm across treated area. Some areas show slight color variation—perhaps due to differential cleaning—but overall surface integrity remains excellent. Thermal effects appear minimal, with only occasional localized discoloration at grain boundaries (likely from calcium oxide formation). EDX analysis now shows clean calcium carbonate signature, sulfur and carbon contaminants reduced to trace levels below 0.5%. Surface reflectivity increases from initial 15% to approximately 32%, this improvement indicates successful contaminant removal without substrate damage. The crystalline structure, it appears well-preserved with sharp grain boundaries and minimal micro-fracturing. Laser parameters were well-controlled, achieving conservation-grade cleaning where original surface features remain fully legible.
