    compressiveStrength:
      value: 200.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Compressive strength is a highly variable property for natural
        stone like basalt, dependent on mineralogy, porosity, and fracturing. The
        reported value of 200 MPa is a widely cited average for intact, unweathered
        basalt core specimens tested under standard laboratory conditions (uniaxial
        compression, room temperature/dry). However, values can range from approximately
        100 MPa for lower-quality or vesicular basalt to over 300 MPa for very dense,
        massive flows. The provided source (ASTM) defines the standard test method
        used to determine this property.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock with a fine-grained, dense
        microstructure that makes it highly resistant to environmental weathering
        and chemical attack. Its mineral composition (primarily plagioclase and pyroxene)
        is chemically stable. Authoritative stone conservation sources rate its durability
        and corrosion resistance as "high" to "very high," placing it in the upper
        tier of natural building stones, though not completely inert like some silica-rich
        stones (e.g., quartzite).

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 45.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is a median figure from authoritative engineering
        literature for basalt's flexural strength, which typically ranges from 20
        MPa to 70 MPa depending on mineralogy and test conditions (4-point bend).
        This range is consistent with basalt's known properties as a dense, fine-grained,
        and hard stone.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 850.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The cited NASA report details the performance of basalt fibers
        in high-temperature oxidizing environments. It identifies that basalt materials
        begin to experience significant oxidation and a corresponding rapid decrease
        in mechanical strength starting at approximately 850°C in air. This temperature
        is consistent with the oxidation of iron compounds within the basalt's mineral
        structure.

        fixed value and shows variation depending on factors like mineralogy, porosity,
        and microcrack density. However, experimental studies on intact basalt cores,
        such as those conducted by Nara et al. (2011) using the ISRM-suggested method,
        report typical Mode I fracture toughness (K_IC) values in the range of 1.0
        to 2.0 MPa·√m. The provided value of 1.5 MPa·√m is a representative median
        from such authoritative rock mechanics literature.
