        source: National Park Service, "Rock and Mineral Properties for Stone Conservation"
        research_basis: Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock with a fine-grained, dense
          microstructure that makes it highly resistant to environmental weathering
          and chemical attack. Its mineral composition (primarily plagioclase and
          pyroxene) is chemically stable. Authoritative stone conservation sources
          rate its durability and corrosion resistance as "high" to "very high," placing
          it in the upper tier of natural building stones, though not completely inert
          like some silica-rich stones (e.g., quartzite).

        research_basis: The cited NASA report details the performance of basalt fibers
          in high-temperature oxidizing environments. It identifies that basalt materials
          begin to experience significant oxidation and a corresponding rapid decrease
          in mechanical strength starting at approximately 850°C in air. This temperature
          is consistent with the oxidation of iron compounds within the basalt's mineral
          structure.

        research_basis: The provided value is a median figure from authoritative engineering
          literature for basalt's flexural strength, which typically ranges from 20
          MPa to 70 MPa depending on mineralogy and test conditions (4-point bend).
          This range is consistent with basalt's known properties as a dense, fine-grained,
          and hard stone.

          and Temperatures"
        research_basis: Compressive strength is a highly variable property for natural
          stone like basalt, dependent on mineralogy, porosity, and fracturing. The
          reported value of 200 MPa is a widely cited average for intact, unweathered
          basalt core specimens tested under standard laboratory conditions (uniaxial
          compression, room temperature/dry). However, values can range from approximately
          100 MPa for lower-quality or vesicular basalt to over 300 MPa for very dense,
          massive flows. The provided source (ASTM) defines the standard test method
          used to determine this property.
