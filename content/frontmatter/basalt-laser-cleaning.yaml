  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated basalt surface reveals a rough and pitted
    landscape dotted with fine dust particles and oily residues. These contaminants
    fill the natural pores, causing discoloration, micro-cracks, and dullness. The
    surface, it demonstrates early degradation signs, weakening the stone's integrity
    for general cleaning applications.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned basalt surface shows a smooth, even restoration. Material
    integrity stays strong, and the stone's natural durability remains unchanged.

        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.9
        research_basis: Compressive strength is a highly variable property for natural
          stone like basalt, dependent on mineralogy, porosity, and fracturing. The
          reported value of 200 MPa is a widely cited average for intact, unweathered
          basalt core specimens tested under standard laboratory conditions (uniaxial
          compression, room temperature/dry). However, values can range from approximately
          100 MPa for lower-quality or vesicular basalt to over 300 MPa for very dense,
          massive flows. The provided source (ASTM) defines the standard test method
          used to determine this property.

        research_basis: Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock with a fine-grained, dense
          microstructure that makes it highly resistant to environmental weathering
          and chemical attack. Its mineral composition (primarily plagioclase and
          pyroxene) is chemically stable. Authoritative stone conservation sources
          rate its durability and corrosion resistance as "high" to "very high," placing
          it in the upper tier of natural building stones, though not completely inert
          like some silica-rich stones (e.g., quartzite).
