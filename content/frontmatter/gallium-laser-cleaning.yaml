        research_basis: Gallium is highly reactive and corrosive. It readily alloys
          with and embrittles most metals (including aluminum and steel) by liquid
          metal embrittlement and diffusion. In air, it forms a passive oxide layer,
          but this offers minimal protection in practical applications, especially
          against other materials. Its corrosive nature is a primary limitation in
          handling and storage.

        research_basis: The provided hardness value of 60.0 MPa is used as a direct
          proxy for flexural strength. For extremely soft, low-melting-point metals
          like gallium, which cannot be tested in a standard bend test, hardness is
          often the only available mechanical property and is closely related to yield/flexural
          strength. MatWeb, an authoritative materials database, lists this hardness
          value as a key indicator of gallium's mechanical performance, as a conventional
          bend test is not feasible.

        research_basis: The provided hardness value of 60.0 MPa is used as a direct
          proxy for compressive strength. For soft, low-melting-point metals like
          gallium, the yield strength under compression is very close to its indentation
          hardness. MatWeb, a widely referenced database for material properties,
          lists this hardness value, which is consistent with the material's known
          softness and low mechanical strength.

        research_basis: Gallium is an extremely low-strength, ductile metal with a
          melting point of 29.8°C, very close to room temperature. At room temperature,
          it lacks a well-defined fracture toughness (K_IC) as it behaves in a ductile
          manner and cannot sustain a sharp crack necessary for a valid K_IC measurement.
          Standard fracture toughness testing is not applicable. The value is effectively
          zero as the material yields and flows instead of fracturing in a brittle
          manner.
