  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated gallium surface shows irregular oxide
    films and adherent dust particles, causing micro-pitting and dulled reflectivity.
    This degradation hinders precise cleaning in semiconductor laser optics.
  afterText: After cleaning, the gallium surface restores to a smooth, defect-free
    state, maintaining full material integrity and optical clarity. This high-quality
    restoration supports reliable performance in laser diode fabrication, ensuring
    long-term functionality.

        embrittlement and diffusion. In air, it forms a passive oxide layer, but this

      research_basis: The provided hardness value of 60.0 MPa is used as a direct

        like gallium, which cannot be tested in a standard bend test, hardness is
        often the only available mechanical property and is closely related to yield/flexural
        strength. MatWeb, an authoritative materials database, lists this hardness
        value as a key indicator of gallium's mechanical performance, as a conventional
        bend test is not feasible.

    fractureToughness:

      research_basis: Gallium is an extremely low-strength, ductile metal with a melting
        point of 29.8°C, very close to room temperature. At room temperature, it lacks
        a well-defined fracture toughness (K_IC) as it behaves in a ductile manner
        and cannot sustain a sharp crack necessary for a valid K_IC measurement. Standard
        fracture toughness testing is not applicable. The value is effectively zero
        as the material yields and flows instead of fracturing in a brittle manner.

        research_basis: The provided hardness value of 60.0 MPa is used as a direct
          proxy for flexural strength. For extremely soft, low-melting-point metals
          like gallium, which cannot be tested in a standard bend test, hardness is
          often the only available mechanical property and is closely related to yield/flexural
          strength. MatWeb, an authoritative materials database, lists this hardness
          value as a key indicator of gallium's mechanical performance, as a conventional
          bend test is not feasible.

        research_basis: Gallium is an extremely low-strength, ductile metal with a
          melting point of 29.8°C, very close to room temperature. At room temperature,
          it lacks a well-defined fracture toughness (K_IC) as it behaves in a ductile
          manner and cannot sustain a sharp crack necessary for a valid K_IC measurement.
          Standard fracture toughness testing is not applicable. The value is effectively
          zero as the material yields and flows instead of fracturing in a brittle
          manner.
