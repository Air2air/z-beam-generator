caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the tantalum surface appears rough and contaminated
    with fine oxide particles and residues. This demonstrates pitting and uneven degradation,
    impacting its reliability in aerospace and medical applications.
  afterText: The cleaned tantalum surface appears smooth and contaminant-free. Restoration
    preserves material integrity for medical and aerospace applications. This demonstrates
    reliable processing quality.
