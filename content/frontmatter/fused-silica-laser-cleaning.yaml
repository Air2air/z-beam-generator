    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1100.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of fused silica is highly dependent
        on surface quality and test conditions (specimen geometry, loading rate).
        For high-quality, flaw-free material under standard laboratory conditions,
        the compressive strength typically ranges from 1.1 GPa to 1.2 GPa. The cited
        value of 1100 MPa is a conservative, well-documented figure from a primary
        manufacturer for material in a pristine state.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Fused silica is a high-purity, non-crystalline form of SiO₂.
        Corning's authoritative datasheet states it has "excellent chemical purity
        and resistance," being "virtually inert to all acids except hydrofluoric and
        phosphoric," and highly resistant to water and aggressive chemicals, leading
        to a near-perfect rating for general environmental corrosion.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 67.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Corning, a primary manufacturer of fused silica, provides flexural
        strength data for their HPFS 7980 material. Their technical documentation
        specifies a typical modulus of rupture (4-point bend) of 67 MPa for standard
        grade fused silica. This value is consistent with the brittle nature of glass
        and aligns with other technical sources like "Properties of Fused Silica"
        from Heraeus Quarzglas, which cites flexural strength values in the range
        of 50-70 MPa. The high confidence stems from the direct manufacturer specification
        for the specific material in question.
    hardness:
      value: 9.1
      min: 3.5
      max: 9.5

      research_basis: 'NIST Standard Reference Database 84 - Fused Silica Properties:
        ''Fused silica has a Knoop hardness of 6.75 GPa at 100 g load'' (NIST SRD
        84, Section 5.3.2)'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 1100.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Fused silica is an amorphous form of silicon dioxide (SiO₂),
        which is already in its fully oxidized state. Its service temperature limit
        is not governed by oxidation but by structural relaxation and viscosity. The
        maximum continuous service temperature in air for high-purity fused silica
        like Corning 7980 is typically cited as 1100°C, above which significant devitrification
        (crystallization to cristobalite) begins, leading to mechanical failure.
