      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        a standard epoxy-based CFRP. The ASM Handbook, a leading authority, lists
        a typical compressive strength range of 500-700 MPa for unidirectional CFRP.
        The value of 570 MPa is a representative median for this common composite
        class under standard ambient test conditions (room temperature, quasi-static
        loading).

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: CFRP exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to a wide range
        of chemicals, salts, and atmospheric conditions because the polymer matrix
        (typically epoxy) protects the carbon fibers. It does not rust or corrode
        like metals. However, it is rated slightly below a '10' because it can suffer
        from galvanic corrosion when in contact with metals, and the polymer matrix
        can be susceptible to degradation from UV exposure and certain solvents over
        very long periods.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 600.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        a standard epoxy-based CFRP. Flexural strength is a primary design parameter
        for CFRP and is highly dependent on the fiber type, orientation, and volume
        fraction. For a common, quasi-isotropic layup, authoritative engineering databases
        (like ASM, MatWeb, CES EduPack) report typical flexural strength values in
        the range of 500-700 MPa. The value of 600 MPa is a representative median
        from these sources for a 3-point bend test, though the exact value can vary
        significantly with the specific composite formulation and manufacturing process.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 177.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for CFRP in air is
        limited by the polymer matrix (typically epoxy), not the carbon fibers. Epoxy
        resins begin significant oxidative degradation and loss of mechanical properties
        around 177°C (350°F). While carbon fibers are stable to much higher temperatures
        in inert atmospheres, this matrix-dominated property defines the material's
        upper use limit in an oxidative environment.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 38.5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: CFRP fracture toughness is highly dependent on fiber orientation,
        matrix type, and fiber volume fraction. For unidirectional CFRP in the fiber
        direction, K_IC typically ranges from 32-45 MPa·√m. The wide range accounts
        for variations in epoxy vs. thermoplastic matrices and testing methodologies.
        Lower values (32-38 MPa·√m) are typical for brittle epoxy systems, while toughened
        matrices can reach 45 MPa·√m.
