          Composites"'
        research_basis: CFRP exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to a wide range
          of chemicals, salts, and atmospheric conditions because the polymer matrix
          (typically epoxy) protects the carbon fibers. It does not rust or corrode
          like metals. However, it is rated slightly below a '10' because it can suffer
          from galvanic corrosion when in contact with metals, and the polymer matrix
          can be susceptible to degradation from UV exposure and certain solvents
          over very long periods.

          Reinforced Polymer (Epoxy) Composites"'
        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for CFRP in air
          is limited by the polymer matrix (typically epoxy), not the carbon fibers.
          Epoxy resins begin significant oxidative degradation and loss of mechanical
          properties around 177°C (350°F). While carbon fibers are stable to much
          higher temperatures in inert atmospheres, this matrix-dominated property
          defines the material's upper use limit in an oxidative environment.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a standard epoxy-based CFRP. Flexural strength is a primary design
          parameter for CFRP and is highly dependent on the fiber type, orientation,
          and volume fraction. For a common, quasi-isotropic layup, authoritative
          engineering databases (like ASM, MatWeb, CES EduPack) report typical flexural
          strength values in the range of 500-700 MPa. The value of 600 MPa is a representative
          median from these sources for a 3-point bend test, though the exact value
          can vary significantly with the specific composite formulation and manufacturing
          process.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent

          lists a typical compressive strength range of 500-700 MPa for unidirectional
          CFRP. The value of 570 MPa is a representative median for this common composite
          class under standard ambient test conditions (room temperature, quasi-static
          loading).

          direction, K_IC typically ranges from 32-45 MPa·√m. The wide range accounts
          for variations in epoxy vs. thermoplastic matrices and testing methodologies.
          Lower values (32-38 MPa·√m) are typical for brittle epoxy systems, while
          toughened matrices can reach 45 MPa·√m.
