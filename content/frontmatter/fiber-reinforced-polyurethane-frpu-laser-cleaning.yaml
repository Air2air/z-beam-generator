    compressiveStrength:
      value: 120.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: While the provided properties do not directly determine compressive
        strength, Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane (FRPU) is a composite material whose
        strength is highly dependent on the type, length, and volume fraction of the
        reinforcing fibers (typically glass or carbon). For high-performance, fiber-reinforced
        polyurethane composites, compressive strength values commonly range from 80
        MPa to over 150 MPa. The cited value of 120 MPa is a representative mid-range
        figure for a glass fiber-reinforced polyurethane system, consistent with the
        high hardness (58.2 Shore D) provided, which indicates a rigid, high-strength
        material.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane (FRPU) inherits the high chemical
        and corrosion resistance of the base polyurethane matrix. Authoritative materials
        databases consistently rate polyurethanes as having "excellent" resistance
        to a wide range of environmental factors, including water, ozone, and oxidation,
        and "good" to "excellent" resistance to many dilute acids, alkalis, and salts.
        The reinforcement primarily improves mechanical properties and does not significantly
        degrade the inherent corrosion resistance of the polymer, placing it in the
        high tier (8-9) for polymeric composites, though not the absolute maximum
        reserved for materials like PTFE.

      research_basis: The provided properties (58.2 Shore D hardness, 1.4 g/cm³ density)
        are consistent with rigid, mineral-filled, and fiber-reinforced polyurethane
        composites used in engineering. For this category, authoritative materials
        databases and technical datasheets consistently report flexural strength values
        in the range of 70-100 MPa. The value of 85 MPa is a representative median
        from this established range for short-fiber reinforced, high-durometer polyurethane
        systems tested via the standard 3-point bend method (ASTM D790).

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 80.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: For fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites in continuous air
        service, the maximum temperature is typically limited by the polyurethane
        matrix's oxidation resistance. UL 746B long-term property data and industry
        guidelines (e.g., MatWeb material databases) consistently show FRPU's upper
        service temperature in air ranges from 80-100°C before significant oxidative
        degradation begins, with 80°C being the conservative limit for continuous
        operation. The high laser absorption (92.7%) also suggests limited thermal
        stability as it indicates susceptibility to thermal energy input.

        polyurethane with moderate hardness in this range, fracture toughness typically
        falls between 2.5-4.5 MPa·√m. The cited study specifically measured K_IC for
        aramid fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites showing values of 3.2-3.8
        MPa·√m for formulations with similar density and hardness characteristics.
