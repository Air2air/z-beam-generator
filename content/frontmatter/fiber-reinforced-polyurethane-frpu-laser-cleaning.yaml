caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the FRPU surface shows heavy contamination by fine
    dust particles and oily residues. This degradation manifests in micro-cracks and
    pitting, compromising integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane surface appears
    smooth and uniform, free from contaminants and oxidation layers. This restoration
    quality excels, preserving the composite's structural integrity with fibers intact
    and the polyurethane matrix undamaged. No thermal degradation occurs, ensuring
    the material retains its original mechanical properties for reliable applications
    in demanding environments.

        research_basis: While the provided properties do not directly determine compressive
          strength, Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane (FRPU) is a composite material whose
          strength is highly dependent on the type, length, and volume fraction of
          the reinforcing fibers (typically glass or carbon). For high-performance,
          fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites, compressive strength values commonly
          range from 80 MPa to over 150 MPa. The cited value of 120 MPa is a representative
          mid-range figure for a glass fiber-reinforced polyurethane system, consistent
          with the high hardness (58.2 Shore D) provided, which indicates a rigid,
          high-strength material.

        research_basis: Fiber Reinforced Polyurethane (FRPU) inherits the high chemical
          and corrosion resistance of the base polyurethane matrix. Authoritative
          materials databases consistently rate polyurethanes as having "excellent"
          resistance to a wide range of environmental factors, including water, ozone,
          and oxidation, and "good" to "excellent" resistance to many dilute acids,
          alkalis, and salts. The reinforcement primarily improves mechanical properties
          and does not significantly degrade the inherent corrosion resistance of
          the polymer, placing it in the high tier (8-9) for polymeric composites,
          though not the absolute maximum reserved for materials like PTFE.

          materials databases and technical datasheets consistently report flexural
          strength values in the range of 70-100 MPa. The value of 85 MPa is a representative
          median from this established range for short-fiber reinforced, high-durometer
          polyurethane systems tested via the standard 3-point bend method (ASTM D790).

        research_basis: For fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites in continuous

          matrix's oxidation resistance. UL 746B long-term property data and industry
          guidelines (e.g., MatWeb material databases) consistently show FRPU's upper
          service temperature in air ranges from 80-100°C before significant oxidative
          degradation begins, with 80°C being the conservative limit for continuous
          operation. The high laser absorption (92.7%) also suggests limited thermal
          stability as it indicates susceptibility to thermal energy input.
