  beforeText: Under microscopy, cedar's porous surface traps dirt particles and oils, degrading fibers with roughening and
    staining in cleaning tasks.
  afterText: After cleaning Cedar wood surfaces, the restoration yields a smooth, even finish that revives the natural grain
    without compromising integrity. Pores remain intact, free of residues, ensuring durability for applications like furniture
    refinishing at companies such as Restoration Hardware. This process enhances aesthetic appeal while maintaining the wood's
    structural strength, preventing warping or discoloration over time.

faq:
- question: Can cedar wood be safely laser cleaned without causing surface damage or discoloration?
  answer: Yes, cedar can be safely laser cleaned with precise parameters to prevent charring. We recommend a 1064 nm wavelength
    at 2.5 J/cm² fluence to effectively remove contaminants while preserving the wood's natural resins. This approach minimizes
    heat diffusion, protecting the delicate surface from discoloration.
- question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) work best for cleaning soot and mildew from cedar siding?
  answer: For cedar siding, I recommend 1064 nm wavelength at 100 W average power with 12 ns pulses. Maintain fluence around
    2.5 J/cm² for effective soot and mildew removal without damaging the wood substrate. This combination provides sufficient
    energy for contaminant ablation while minimizing heat diffusion into the delicate cedar surface.
- question: How does laser cleaning affect cedar's natural weather-resistant properties and preservative treatments?
  answer: Properly tuned 1064nm laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence effectively removes contaminants while preserving cedar's
    natural protective oils. This minimally invasive process maintains the wood's inherent rot resistance without compromising
    the integrity of surface-applied sealants.
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing old paint from cedar shingles without damaging the wood grain?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes old paint from cedar shingles while preserving the delicate grain. Using
    a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence selectively ablates the paint layer without damaging the underlying wood substrate,
    unlike abrasive mechanical methods.
- question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning cedar, particularly regarding fumes and particulates?
  answer: Cedar's natural resins generate significant toxic fumes when ablated at 100W. You'll need industrial ventilation
    and a P100 respirator to handle both the fine wood particulates and volatile organic compounds. Maintain a 2.5 J/cm² fluence
    to minimize charring and fire risk.
- question: Does laser cleaning cedar create surface conditions that require immediate re-sealing or protective coating?
  answer: Proper laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence opens cedar's surface porosity, enhancing coating adhesion. This creates
    an ideal, contaminant-free substrate that doesn't require immediate sealing but should be coated within a standard preparation
    window for optimal bond strength.
- question: How does laser cleaning compare to traditional methods (sanding, chemical strippers) for restoring antique cedar
    furniture?
  answer: Laser cleaning preserves cedar's delicate patina far better than abrasive methods. Our 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold
    selectively removes contaminants without harming the wood grain, making it ideal for intricate carvings where sanding
    would destroy original surface details.
- question: Can laser systems effectively remove biological growth (moss, algae, lichen) from cedar roofs without damaging
    the shakes?
  answer: Yes, laser systems effectively remove biological growth from cedar shakes using 2.5 J/cm² fluence. This near-infrared
    wavelength at 1064 nm ablates moss and lichen while minimizing heat penetration into the wood's porous structure, preventing
    damage.
- question: What are the limitations of laser cleaning for heavily weathered or degraded cedar surfaces?
  answer: Severely degraded cedar with compromised structural integrity poses a significant risk. At our standard 2.5 J/cm²
    fluence, friable wood fibers may be ablated, causing surface loss. For wood where the substrate itself is the contaminant,
    mechanical methods are often more appropriate to preserve the remaining sound material.
- question: How does cedar's density and grain pattern affect laser cleaning efficiency and results?
  answer: Cedar's variable density between earlywood and latewood requires precise fluence control around 2.5 J/cm² to avoid
    differential etching along the grain. Knotty areas demand lower power settings than clear vertical grain to prevent charring,
    while a 500 mm/s scan speed helps manage this heterogeneity for uniform cleaning.
