caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, cedar's porous surface traps dirt particles and oils,
    degrading fibers with roughening and staining in cleaning tasks.
  afterText: After cleaning Cedar wood surfaces, the restoration yields a smooth,
    even finish that revives the natural grain without compromising integrity. Pores
    remain intact, free of residues, ensuring durability for applications like furniture
    refinishing at companies such as Restoration Hardware. This process enhances aesthetic
    appeal while maintaining the wood's structural strength, preventing warping or
    discoloration over time.

        research_basis: Cedar wood demonstrates moderate natural decay resistance
          due to extractives and oils that provide some protection against fungi and
          insects. However, it has limited resistance to moisture, weathering, and
          ground contact compared to more durable woods like teak or ipe. Western
          Red Cedar, for example, typically receives a "moderate" durability rating
          with a service life of 15-25 years for above-ground applications, placing
          it in the lower-middle range of wood durability scales.
