    compressiveStrength:
      value: 31.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database reports compressive strength (crushing strength)
        parallel to grain for Eastern White Cedar as 3,170 psi, which converts to
        31.0 MPa. This aligns with typical values for softwoods in this density range
        (0.37 g/cm³). Test conditions are standard ASTM D143 for small clear specimens
        at 12% moisture content.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 4.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Cedar wood demonstrates moderate natural decay resistance due
        to extractives and oils that provide some protection against fungi and insects.
        However, it has limited resistance to moisture, weathering, and ground contact
        compared to more durable woods like teak or ipe. Western Red Cedar, for example,
        typically receives a "moderate" durability rating with a service life of 15-25
        years for above-ground applications, placing it in the lower-middle range
        of wood durability scales.

      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
        reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Western Red Cedar as 7,500 psi, which
        converts to approximately 59.0 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength
        measured via standard 3-point bend testing per ASTM D143 standards for small
        clear wood specimens.

      research_basis: The source provides an ignition temperature range of 170-190°C
        for various wood species in long-term exposure. The lower end of this range
        (170°C) is the temperature at which significant thermal degradation and oxidation
        begin, but 177°C is a commonly cited maximum safe continuous service temperature
        for wood in engineering applications before charring and significant loss
        of mechanical properties occur.

      research_basis: The provided value is a typical range for clear wood in the
        radial-longitudinal (RL) crack propagation system. Cedar, being a softwood,
        generally has a fracture toughness between 0.3 and 0.5 MPa·√m. The value of
        0.37 MPa·√m is a representative mid-range figure for such species, consistent
        with data published by authoritative sources like the USDA Forest Products
        Laboratory.
