    compressiveStrength:
      value: 200.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of Porphyry is highly variable, ranging
        from approximately 150 MPa to over 250 MPa depending on its specific mineral
        composition and quarry source. The provided value is a conservative average
        based on industry-standard testing (ASTM C170) of saturated specimens, as
        reported by authoritative stone industry guides. The listed material properties
        (high density and hardness) are consistent with a rock possessing high compressive
        strength.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Porphyry is an igneous rock with high quartz content (SiO₂ >65%)
        and a dense, interlocking crystalline structure, making it highly resistant
        to chemical weathering and environmental corrosion. It is classified as a
        high-strength, durable dimension stone comparable to granite. Its performance
        in harsh environmental conditions and historical use in paving and monuments
        supports this high corrosion resistance rating, though it is slightly less
        resistant than some denser granites or quartzites.

        Specific Gravity of Dimension Stone, supplemented by geological studies of

      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided source compiles technical data from multiple international
        testing laboratories and standards (ASTM, EN). It reports a typical flexural
        strength range for porphyry of 10-20 MPa, with 15 MPa being a commonly cited
        average value for design purposes, typically determined via a 4-point bend
        test.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Porphyry is a textural term for igneous rocks, typically with
        a feldspar or quartz-feldspar groundmass. Authoritative geological guides
        (BGS) classify common igneous rocks like granite and andesite (which encompass
        most porphyries) as having a maximum service temperature of 600°C in air before
        significant mineral decomposition and oxidation begin, primarily due to the
        oxidation of iron minerals and thermal breakdown of feldspars. This is a conservative
        estimate for the porphyry category.

      research_basis: Fracture toughness (K_IC) for porphyry falls within a typical
        range for fine-grained igneous rocks. The cited value of 1.21 MPa·√m is derived
        from a statistical analysis of multiple rock types presented in this authoritative
        ISRM compilation, where porphyritic rocks consistently show values between
        1.0 and 1.5 MPa·√m. This range is characteristic of its mineralogy and interlocking
        crystalline texture.
