caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, contaminated porphyry surface appears very-very rough
    and degraded. Fine dust particles and organic residues cling tightly, so pitting
    forms and natural shine dims.
  afterText: The cleaned porphyry surface appears very-very smooth and clean. Restoration
    quality is high, so material integrity stays intact. Process removes stains then
    restores original texture without damage.

          from approximately 150 MPa to over 250 MPa depending on its specific mineral
          composition and quarry source. The provided value is a conservative average

          reported by authoritative stone industry guides. The listed material properties
          (high density and hardness) are consistent with a rock possessing high compressive
          strength.

          >65%) and a dense, interlocking crystalline structure, making it highly
          resistant to chemical weathering and environmental corrosion. It is classified
          as a high-strength, durable dimension stone comparable to granite. Its performance
          in harsh environmental conditions and historical use in paving and monuments
          supports this high corrosion resistance rating, though it is slightly less
          resistant than some denser granites or quartzites.

          a feldspar or quartz-feldspar groundmass. Authoritative geological guides
          (BGS) classify common igneous rocks like granite and andesite (which encompass
          most porphyries) as having a maximum service temperature of 600°C in air
          before significant mineral decomposition and oxidation begin, primarily
          due to the oxidation of iron minerals and thermal breakdown of feldspars.
          This is a conservative estimate for the porphyry category.
