  beforeText: Under microscopy, contaminated porphyry surface appears very-very rough and degraded. Fine dust particles and
    organic residues cling tightly, so pitting forms and natural shine dims.
  afterText: The cleaned porphyry surface appears very-very smooth and clean. Restoration quality is high, so material integrity
    stays intact. Process removes stains then restores original texture without damage.

faq:
- question: What are the best laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning biological growth like lichen
    and moss from Porphyry without damaging the crystalline matrix?
  answer: Untuk membersihkan pertumbuhan biologis pada Porphyry, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluens 12.7 J/cm² dan daya 100
    W. Durasi pulsa nanodetik ini mengablasikan organik secara selektif, menghindari kejutan termal pada matriks kristalin
    feldspar yang sensitif. Pengaturan ini mempertahankan integritas mineral tanpa menyebabkan perubahan warna.
- question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove black gypsum crusts from Porphyry surfaces, and what are the risks of leaving
    behind altered mineral phases?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively removes black gypsum crusts from Porphyry at 12.7 J/cm², but risks forming altered mineral
    phases like anhydrite. The 1064 nm wavelength minimizes sub-surface damage to phenocrysts. Verify complete removal using
    Raman spectroscopy to detect residual sulfates without surface etching.
- question: How does the variable composition and porosity of Porphyry affect the consistency of laser cleaning results across
    a single slab or facade?
  answer: Porphyry's variable crystal distribution and porous groundmass create inconsistent absorption of our 12.7 J/cm²
    fluence. This demands constant power and scan speed adjustments to prevent uneven cleaning, as denser areas resist ablation
    while pores may overheat.
- question: Is there a risk of thermal cracking or micro-fracturing in Porphyry's large feldspar phenocrysts during laser
    cleaning, especially with high-power or continuous-wave lasers?
  answer: Thermal cracking risk is significant due to differing expansion coefficients between feldspar phenocrysts and groundmass.
    Use nanosecond pulses at 12.7 J/cm² to confine thermal stress, preventing micro-fractures in the crystalline structure.
    This regime ensures controlled contaminant ablation.
- question: What is the recommended method for post-laser cleaning residue removal from the rough, often pitted, surface of
    Porphyry?
  answer: For Porphyry's pitted surface, I recommend combining low-pressure water rinsing with soft nylon brushing after laser
    ablation at 12.7 J/cm². This effectively dislodges trapped particles from vesicles without the risk of micro-fracture
    propagation that air abrasion can cause.
- question: For historical Porphyry monuments, does laser cleaning cause any irreversible color changes, particularly to the
    characteristic purplish-red hues?
  answer: At 12.7 J/cm² fluence, ns-pulsed 1064 nm lasers effectively remove contaminants without altering Porphyry's purplish-red
    hematite pigments. This wavelength's mineral-specific interaction preserves the stone's chromatic integrity, as demonstrated
    in European monument conservation projects.
- question: How do we validate the success of a laser cleaning process on Porphyry? What non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
    are most effective?
  answer: Validasi keberhasilan pada Porphyry memerlukan spektrofotometri untuk memastikan warna asli tercapai dan mikroskopi
    untuk memeriksa integritas permukaan. Pengujian ultrasonik juga efektif mendeteksi delaminasi sub-permukaan yang tak kasat
    mata akibat paparan fluence 12.7 J/cm².
- question: Why might laser cleaning be preferred over chemical or abrasive methods for sensitive Porphyry restoration?
  answer: Laser cleaning preserves Porphyry's delicate arrises and patina, unlike abrasive methods. With precise parameters
    like a 12.7 J/cm² fluence threshold, it selectively removes contaminants without chemical runoff or substrate damage,
    ensuring the stone's integrity.
- question: What are the specific safety considerations (e.g., fume extraction, PPE) when laser cleaning Porphyry, given its
    potential metal oxide content?
  answer: Porphyry's metal oxide content requires HEPA filtration for hazardous aerosols like crystalline silica. At 100 W
    and 1064 nm wavelength, proper fume extraction is critical. Operators must wear P3-rated respiratory protection to mitigate
    exposure to these fine particulates generated during the ablation process.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a Porphyry surface for subsequent treatments like consolidation or protective
    coatings?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 12.7 J/cm² effectively prepares Porphyry by removing contaminants to create a micro-rough, chemically
    clean surface that enhances coating adhesion. However, careful parameter control is essential to prevent surface glazing,
    which would reduce the permeability required for subsequent consolidation treatments. The 1064 nm wavelength is particularly
    suitable for this stone's mineralogy.
