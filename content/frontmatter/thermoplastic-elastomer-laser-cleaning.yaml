caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the thermoplastic elastomer composite surface shows
    uneven contamination from oil residues and particulates, forming irregular clusters
    that obscure the matrix. Contaminants exhibit hydrophobic beads and fibrous debris,
    accelerating degradation via micro-cracks and pitting. In aerospace seals, this
    compromises laser system integrity by promoting fatigue failure.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of the thermoplastic elastomer composite displays
    a smooth, residue-free finish, fully restoring its original texture and clarity.
    Restoration quality is exceptional, with no visible defects or discoloration.
    Material integrity stays intact, preserving elasticity and tensile strength without
    degradation. This supports durable performance in automotive seals exposed to
    harsh vibrations.
