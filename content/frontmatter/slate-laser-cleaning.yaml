        Durability of Slate as a Dimension Stone'' (P. Navarro et al., Construction

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Slate is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz, mica,
        and chlorite minerals, which are chemically inert and highly resistant to
        environmental degradation. The ASTM standard notes slate's exceptional durability
        and resistance to weathering, acid rain, and freeze-thaw cycles, making it
        a premier choice for exterior applications like roofing and flooring where
        long-term corrosion/weathering resistance is critical. Its low porosity and
        dense foliated structure prevent water and corrosive agents from penetrating
        the material.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 95.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is a typical average derived from standardized
        3-point bend tests on slate specimens as per ASTM C880. Slate's flexural strength
        is anisotropic and varies significantly (approximately 60-130 MPa) based on
        foliation orientation (rift, grain, head grain) and specific quarry. The value
        of 95 MPa represents a reasonable, conservative estimate for load-bearing
        calculations, supported by data from the Natural Stone Institute and technical
        stone literature.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Slate is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of quartz and
        muscovite/illite. Authoritative materials databases indicate its maximum service
        temperature in air is approximately 600°C. Beyond this temperature, the structural
        bound water in the clay minerals begins to decompose, and the iron-containing
        minerals start to oxidize, leading to significant degradation in strength
        and potential spalling.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.1
      min: 0.5
      max: 5
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Fracture toughness in slate is highly anisotropic due to its
        strong foliation. Values are typically low and vary with crack orientation
        relative to the cleavage planes. The cited value of 1.1 MPa·√m is a representative
        mean for splitting (division) fracture toughness parallel to the cleavage,
        which is the most common and critical mode of failure for this material. Data
        from standardized rock mechanics testing confirms slate's K_IC generally falls
        within the range of 0.8 to 1.5 MPa·√m.
