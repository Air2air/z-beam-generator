caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, slate surface appears very-very rough, covered by
    fine dust particles and sticky organic residues. These contaminants cling tightly,
    causing pitting degradation and discoloration.
  afterText: The cleaned slate surface shows very-very good restoration, appearing
    smooth and fresh after dirt removal then gentle polishing. Contaminants are eliminated
    completely, so natural stone texture returns without damage. Surface is treated
    softly, maintaining integrity fully—no cracks or weakening seen, and hardness
    preserved. Quality is high, making material look new for general uses.

          mica, and chlorite minerals, which are chemically inert and highly resistant
          to environmental degradation. The ASTM standard notes slate's exceptional
          durability and resistance to weathering, acid rain, and freeze-thaw cycles,
          making it a premier choice for exterior applications like roofing and flooring
          where long-term corrosion/weathering resistance is critical. Its low porosity
          and dense foliated structure prevent water and corrosive agents from penetrating
          the material.

        research_basis: Fracture toughness in slate is highly anisotropic due to its
          strong foliation. Values are typically low and vary with crack orientation
          relative to the cleavage planes. The cited value of 1.1 MPa·√m is a representative
          mean for splitting (division) fracture toughness parallel to the cleavage,
          which is the most common and critical mode of failure for this material.
          Data from standardized rock mechanics testing confirms slate's K_IC generally
          falls within the range of 0.8 to 1.5 MPa·√m.
