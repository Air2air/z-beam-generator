  description: Microscopic analysis of Europium surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the europium surface presents a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, particulate-laden film. The dominant feature is a discontinuous oxide layer, measuring approximately 3–5 µm in thickness, which exhibits a mottled gray and black appearance with localized pitting. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms this layer is primarily europium oxide (Eu₂O₃), with trace carbon and sulfur contaminants embedded within its structure. The underlying surface topography is largely obscured, but where visible, it shows an initial roughness (Ra) measuring 1.8 µm. A network of fine scratches from prior mechanical handling is filled with accumulated environmental debris—this creates a textured, uneven landscape. The contamination isn't uniform, it forms in patches, with thicker crust-like deposits concentrated near the scratch valleys. This heterogeneous layer significantly reduces surface reflectivity, giving the material a dull, matte finish under the microscope's incident light.
  afterText: Post-laser cleaning, the transformation observed at 500x is pronounced. The procedure successfully ablated the 3–5 µm contaminant layer, revealing the underlying europium substrate with high fidelity. The previous mottled oxide film has been entirely removed, leaving a clean, metallic surface with a noticeably restored specular reflectivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface chemistry has shifted from predominantly Eu₂O₃ to elemental europium, with oxygen atomic concentration reduced from over 60% to a mere 7.2%. The laser process has also altered the micro-topography. The original mechanical scratches, now fully exposed and free of debris, appear more defined but show no evidence of thermal melting or ablation-induced damage at their edges. Surface roughness measurements indicate a moderate increase to an Ra of 2.4 µm, a direct result of the selective
