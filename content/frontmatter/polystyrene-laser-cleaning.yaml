        and Elastomers'
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 95.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The reported compressive strength for general-purpose polystyrene
        typically ranges from 80 MPa to 110 MPa. The value of 95 MPa is a median figure
        from this established range, cited by materials databases and engineering
        references. The provided hardness of 80.0 MPa is consistent with this range,
        as compressive strength for rigid plastics is often higher than hardness.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Polystyrene exhibits excellent resistance to water, dilute acids,
        alkalis, and alcohols, which covers most general environmental corrosion factors.
        However, it is attacked by many hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents, and strong
        oxidizing acids, preventing a perfect rating.

      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 50.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The reported flexural strength for general-purpose polystyrene
        from authoritative material databases like MatWeb and CES EduPack typically
        falls in the range of 50-80 MPa. The value of 50 MPa is a conservative and
        commonly cited figure for the lower end of this range, representing a typical
        minimum for the material property.
    hardness:
      value: 80.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 8: Mechanical Testing and Evaluation (2000),
        Table 3 - Typical Mechanical Properties of Thermoplastics, and NIST PS-L Standard
        Reference Material documentation'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 80.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Authoritative materials databases consistently report the maximum
        continuous service temperature in air for General Purpose Polystyrene (GPPS)
        in the range of 70-85°C, with 80°C being a commonly cited upper limit before
        thermal degradation and oxidation become significant.
    tensileStrength:
      value: 45.0
      unit: MPa

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Polystyrene is a brittle, amorphous thermoplastic with low fracture
        toughness. Reported values for general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) typically
        range from 0.7 to 1.1 MPa·√m. The value of 1.0 MPa·√m is a commonly cited
        representative value from materials handbooks and engineering databases for
        this property at room temperature.
