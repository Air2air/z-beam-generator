caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, the polystyrene surface reveals a mottled
    condition, scarred by fine particulate contaminants like dust and oily residues.
    These clusters induce micro-pitting and subtle cracking, eroding the material's
    inherent smoothness.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the polystyrene surface regains its smooth, residue-free
    condition. This restoration preserves full material integrity, with no degradation
    to its plastic properties. Quality matches the original, perfect for general applications.

        research_basis: The reported compressive strength for general-purpose polystyrene
          typically ranges from 80 MPa to 110 MPa. The value of 95 MPa is a median
          figure from this established range, cited by materials databases and engineering
          references. The provided hardness of 80.0 MPa is consistent with this range,
          as compressive strength for rigid plastics is often higher than hardness.
