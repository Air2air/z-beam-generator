        research_basis: Polystyrene exhibits excellent resistance to water, dilute
          acids, alkalis, and alcohols, which covers most general environmental corrosion
          factors. However, it is attacked by many hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents,
          and strong oxidizing acids, preventing a perfect rating.

        research_basis: The reported flexural strength for general-purpose polystyrene
          from authoritative material databases like MatWeb and CES EduPack typically
          falls in the range of 50-80 MPa. The value of 50 MPa is a conservative and
          commonly cited figure for the lower end of this range, representing a typical
          minimum for the material property.

        research_basis: The reported compressive strength for general-purpose polystyrene
          typically ranges from 80 MPa to 110 MPa. The value of 95 MPa is a median
          figure from this established range, cited by materials databases and engineering
          references. The provided hardness of 80.0 MPa is consistent with this range,
          as compressive strength for rigid plastics is often higher than hardness.
