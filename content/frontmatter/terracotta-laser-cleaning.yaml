  beforeText: The microscopy reveals a contaminated terracotta surface, rough and
    porous with fine dust particles and organic residues clinging to the clay. This
    buildup clogs pores, causes discoloration, and promotes minor cracking. Such degradation
    weakens its role in architecture and cultural heritage.
  afterText: The cleaned terracotta surface looks smooth and fresh, with its warm
    reddish tone fully restored. Laser treatment removes dirt and old stains gently,
    and it preserves the material's porous texture without any cracks. This restoration
    quality is reliable for cultural heritage sites and buildings. It demonstrates
    careful integrity in processing.
