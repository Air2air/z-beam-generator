    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Terracotta demonstrates excellent corrosion resistance to atmospheric
        and environmental degradation due to its vitrified ceramic nature. As a fired
        clay product, it is chemically inert and highly resistant to acid rain, pollution,
        and weathering. ASTM standards classify brick and terracotta as having "severe
        weather" (SW) grade for maximum resistance to moisture penetration and frost
        action, indicating superior durability in corrosive environments. The material
        maintains structural integrity when exposed to common environmental corrosives
        that would degrade metals or other masonry materials.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2
      max: 20
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) is a standard property
        for masonry materials. For fired clay products like terracotta, the flexural
        strength is typically 15-25% of its compressive strength. The cited ASTM standard,
        a primary authority for clay-based masonry, lists a minimum modulus of rupture
        of 8.3 MPa (1200 psi) for severe weathering brick, which aligns with the derived
        range from the known compressive strength (45.0 MPa * 0.2 = ~9.0 MPa). The
        value of 8.0 MPa is a conservative, well-attested estimate for a typical terracotta
        body.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 800.0
      min: 300.0
      max: 1200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: While terracotta itself is not a standardized high-temperature
        ceramic, it is a fired clay product. ASTM C62 classifies brick (clay masonry)
        for severe weathering (SW) grade, which must withstand freeze-thaw cycles,
        implying high structural integrity after firing. Industrial and historical
        sources (e.g., National Terracotta Society, 1920s) specify that architectural
        terracotta is fired between 1000-1200°C, creating a stable, oxidized ceramic
        body. Its maximum continuous service temperature in air is limited not by
        oxidation but by the onset of vitrification and loss of mechanical strength,
        beginning around 800°C for typical clay compositions. This is well below its
        original firing temperature, ensuring no further oxidation occurs.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.1
      min: 0.15
      max: 1.1
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Direct fracture toughness (K_IC) data for terracotta is scarce.
        This value is derived from testing of mudstone, a material with a similar
        mineralogical composition (clay-based), porosity, and brittle failure mechanism.
        The cited study provides a K_IC range of 1.0-1.2 MPa·√m for such materials,
        consistent with the low compressive strength and hardness of terracotta.
