caption:
  beforeText: The microscopy reveals a contaminated terracotta surface, rough and porous with fine dust particles and organic
    residues clinging to the clay. This buildup clogs pores, causes discoloration, and promotes minor cracking. Such degradation
    weakens its role in architecture and cultural heritage.
  afterText: The cleaned terracotta surface looks smooth and fresh, with its warm reddish tone fully restored. Laser treatment
    removes dirt and old stains gently, and it preserves the material's porous texture without any cracks. This restoration
    quality is reliable for cultural heritage sites and buildings. It demonstrates careful integrity in processing.

faq:
- question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning terracotta surfaces without causing cracking or discoloration?
  answer: For terracotta cleaning, 1064 nm near-infrared lasers excel by matching the absorption of iron oxides and clays,
    avoiding cracking or discoloration—unlike 532 nm, which risks deeper heating. Aim for 2.5 J/cm² fluence, and always validate
    on sample tiles first.
- question: How does the high porosity of terracotta impact the laser cleaning process, particularly in removing embedded
    salts or dirt?
  answer: Terracotta's high porosity allows laser light at 1064 nm to seep deeper into pores, raising subsurface heating risks
    during embedded salt or dirt removal. To prevent structural weakening, dial pulse energy to 2.5 J/cm² with 10 ns widths,
    balancing ablation efficiency and thermal control for safe cleaning.
- question: What safety precautions are needed when using lasers to clean terracotta artifacts, especially regarding airborne
    clay particles or fumes?
  answer: When laser-cleaning terracotta artifacts at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a 1064 nm beam, prioritize robust ventilation
    systems to trap silica-laden clay particles and any fumes. Operators should don N95 masks, goggles, and gloves for dust
    protection. For painted surfaces, closely watch surface temperatures to avoid pigment degradation from localized heating.
- question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove black crusts from historical terracotta facades without damaging the underlying
    clay matrix?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning removes black crusts from historical terracotta facades effectively through layer-by-layer ablation,
    sparing the fragile clay matrix. At 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, it outperforms mechanical scraping by minimizing
    erosion, as shown in European architectural restorations.
- question: What are the optimal pulse durations and fluences for cleaning terracotta pottery in archaeological contexts?
  answer: For cleaning terracotta pottery in archaeological settings, I recommend nanosecond pulses around 10 ns at a fluence
    of 2.5 J/cm² using a 1064 nm wavelength. This short-pulse approach ablates organic residues selectively while sparing
    the delicate surface patina, unlike longer pulses that risk deeper thermal damage. Adjust scan speed to 500 mm/s for even
    coverage.
- question: How does the low thermal conductivity of terracotta affect heat buildup during laser surface treatment?
  answer: Terracotta's low thermal conductivity traps heat during laser treatment, risking localized cracks at 2.5 J/cm² fluence.
    Scanning at 500 mm/s with 50% overlap promotes dissipation, boosting cleaning efficiency equally for glazed and unglazed
    surfaces while using 100 W power.
- question: Are there specific concerns about laser cleaning terracotta roofs, such as potential for water absorption post-treatment?
  answer: Terracotta's inherent porosity can heighten re-wetting risks after laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence with a 1064
    nm wavelength, potentially accelerating weathering on roofs. Pairing the process with hydrophobic coatings enhances water
    repellency, ensuring long-term outdoor durability by mitigating moisture ingress.
- question: What chemical reactions might occur when lasers interact with mineral impurities in terracotta during cleaning?
  answer: When cleaning terracotta with a 1064 nm laser at 2.5 J/cm² fluence, carbonates in impurities like calcite can thermally
    decompose into lime and CO₂, while sulfates may release SO₂, creating off-gassing hazards that require ventilation. Pre-cleaning
    spectroscopic scans help detect these minerals, allowing safe parameter tweaks to avoid substrate damage.
- question: How do industry standards guide the use of laser cleaning for terracotta in museum conservation projects?
  answer: In museum conservation of terracotta, ICOM-CC guidelines stress non-destructive testing like spectroscopy before
    and after cleaning to safeguard the porous substrate. EN standards mandate detailed documentation of parameters, such
    as 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence, ensuring uniform removal of contaminants without thermal stress on the fragile
    material.
