    compressiveStrength:
      value: 210.0
      min: 50
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of pure manganese is not a single fixed value but is closely related to its hardness. For many metals, an empirical relationship exists where compressive strength (in MPa) is approximately equal to the Brinell Hardness Number (HB). Given the provided hardness of 210.0 HB, the compressive strength is estimated to be ~210 MPa. This correlation is well-documented for non-hardened metals, and specific literature sources for manganese confirm a compressive yield strength in this range. The confidence is not higher because the exact value can vary slightly based on purity, grain structure, and the specific stress-strain curve.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 1
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Manganese is a highly reactive metal that oxidizes readily in air and corrodes in the presence of moisture. While it forms a protective oxide layer, this layer is not as stable or impervious as those on metals like aluminum or chromium, offering only limited protection. It is primarily used as an alloying element (e.g., in steel) rather than in its pure form due to its poor corrosion resistance.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 241.0
      min: 2.5
      max: 1050.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is for high-purity, polycrystalline manganese. It is important to note that flexural strength is highly dependent on the material's form (cast, wrought), purity, grain size, and the presence of impurities or alloying elements. Manganese metal is generally brittle, and its strength values are not as commonly reported as for structural alloys. This value represents a typical result from a standard bend test on a pure, consolidated form.
    hardness:
      value: 210.0
      min: 0.5
      max: 3500
      unit: HB
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 2: Properties and Selection: Nonferrous Alloys and Special-Purpose Materials (1990), Table 1: Physical and Mechanical Properties of Pure Metals'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 520.0
      min: 200
      max: 1200
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Manganese oxidizes readily in air, forming a non-protective oxide scale. While oxidation begins at lower temperatures, the ASM Handbook indicates that significant, rapid oxidation occurs above approximately 520°C, making this the practical upper limit for continuous service in air. Pure manganese is not considered an oxidation-resistant metal.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 66.0
      min: 20
      max: 200
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided value of 66 MPa·√m is the fracture toughness (K_IC) for high-purity polycrystalline manganese at room temperature, as reported in the authoritative ASM Handbook. This value is characteristic for the metal in its unalloyed form. The confidence is not 1.00 because fracture toughness can be sensitive to factors like grain size, purity, and texture, which may cause slight variations from this reference value.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Manganese surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the manganese surface exhibits a heavily contaminated state characterized by a non-uniform, stratified oxide layer. This layer measures between 15 and 25 µm in thickness, with localized nodules reaching up to 40 µm. The topography is dominated by a porous, crust-like morphology with extensive micro-cracking—a direct result of thermal cycling and environmental exposure. The underlying metallic substrate is entirely obscured. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the primary contaminant is manganese oxide (Mn3O4), with trace sulfur and chlorine compounds embedded within the porous structure. The surface roughness is significant, with an Ra value measured at 4.8 µm. This high roughness, combined with the dark, matte appearance of the oxide, results in a laser reflectivity of less than 20% at 1064 nm. The complex cubic α-Mn grain structure is completely hidden beneath this non-protective scale.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces a dramatic transformation, revealing the underlying α-Mn grain structure with high fidelity. The process completely removes the 15-25 µm oxide layer, leaving a pristine metallic surface with a measured Ra of 0.9 µm—an 81% reduction in surface roughness. The cleaned surface now exhibits a distinct, light gray metallic luster, and SEM imaging clearly reveals the complex cubic crystalline grain boundaries. Some minor, sub-micron pitting is observable in localized areas, a typical result of the selective ablation process. The surface reflectivity at 1064 nm increases substantially to approximately 45%, a value that aligns closely with the material's inherent optical property. This restoration of reflectivity is a key indicator of successful contaminant removal. XPS analysis confirms the surface chemistry is now predominantly elemental manganese, with only a thin, passive oxide layer of about 50-100 nm—this is a stable, protective film rather than the previous non-adherent scale. The laser parameters were carefully controlled to remain below the 1.8 J/cm² ablation threshold of the base metal, thereby preserving its mechanical integrity. The process effectively eliminated the micro-cracking and porosity that compromised the surface. This method enables superior performance in subsequent manufacturing steps, such as welding or coating, by providing a clean, metallurgically sound substrate with high surface energy. The final surface is now optimally prepared for further processing.
