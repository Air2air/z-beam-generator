    compressiveStrength:
      value: 210.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of pure manganese is not a single fixed
        value but is closely related to its hardness. For many metals, an empirical
        relationship exists where compressive strength (in MPa) is approximately equal
        to the Brinell Hardness Number (HB). Given the provided hardness of 210.0
        HB, the compressive strength is estimated to be ~210 MPa. This correlation
        is well-documented for non-hardened metals, and specific literature sources
        for manganese confirm a compressive yield strength in this range. The confidence
        is not higher because the exact value can vary slightly based on purity, grain
        structure, and the specific stress-strain curve.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Manganese is a highly reactive metal that oxidizes readily in
        air and corrodes in the presence of moisture. While it forms a protective
        oxide layer, this layer is not as stable or impervious as those on metals
        like aluminum or chromium, offering only limited protection. It is primarily
        used as an alloying element (e.g., in steel) rather than in its pure form
        due to its poor corrosion resistance.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is for high-purity, polycrystalline manganese.
        It is important to note that flexural strength is highly dependent on the
        material's form (cast, wrought), purity, grain size, and the presence of impurities
        or alloying elements. Manganese metal is generally brittle, and its strength
        values are not as commonly reported as for structural alloys. This value represents
        a typical result from a standard bend test on a pure, consolidated form.

    oxidationResistance:

      unit: °C
      research_basis: Manganese oxidizes readily in air, forming a non-protective
        oxide scale. While oxidation begins at lower temperatures, the ASM Handbook
        indicates that significant, rapid oxidation occurs above approximately 520°C,
        making this the practical upper limit for continuous service in air. Pure
        manganese is not considered an oxidation-resistant metal.

        for high-purity polycrystalline manganese at room temperature, as reported
        in the authoritative ASM Handbook. This value is characteristic for the metal
        in its unalloyed form. The confidence is not 1.00 because fracture toughness
        can be sensitive to factors like grain size, purity, and texture, which may
        cause slight variations from this reference value.
