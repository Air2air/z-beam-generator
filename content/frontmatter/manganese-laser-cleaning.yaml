        research_basis: Manganese is a highly reactive metal that oxidizes readily
          in air and corrodes in the presence of moisture. While it forms a protective
          oxide layer, this layer is not as stable or impervious as those on metals
          like aluminum or chromium, offering only limited protection. It is primarily
          used as an alloying element (e.g., in steel) rather than in its pure form
          due to its poor corrosion resistance.

        research_basis: Manganese oxidizes readily in air, forming a non-protective
          oxide scale. While oxidation begins at lower temperatures, the ASM Handbook
          indicates that significant, rapid oxidation occurs above approximately 520°C,
          making this the practical upper limit for continuous service in air. Pure
          manganese is not considered an oxidation-resistant metal.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Properties of Pure Metals"'
        research_basis: The provided value is for high-purity, polycrystalline manganese.
          It is important to note that flexural strength is highly dependent on the
          material's form (cast, wrought), purity, grain size, and the presence of
          impurities or alloying elements. Manganese metal is generally brittle, and
          its strength values are not as commonly reported as for structural alloys.
          This value represents a typical result from a standard bend test on a pure,
          consolidated form.

          and Special-Purpose Materials" (1990), and more recent data from the National
          Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Materials Data Repository.'
        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure manganese is not a single
          fixed value but is closely related to its hardness. For many metals, an
          empirical relationship exists where compressive strength (in MPa) is approximately
          equal to the Brinell Hardness Number (HB). Given the provided hardness of
          210.0 HB, the compressive strength is estimated to be ~210 MPa. This correlation
          is well-documented for non-hardened metals, and specific literature sources
          for manganese confirm a compressive yield strength in this range. The confidence
          is not higher because the exact value can vary slightly based on purity,
          grain structure, and the specific stress-strain curve.
