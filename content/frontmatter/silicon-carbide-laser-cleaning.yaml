caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Silicon Carbide surface shows heavy contamination
    with dark particles and oily residues scattered across it, and this leads to pitting
    and uneven degradation. The semiconductor material appears rougher, impacting
    its general cleaning uses.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the Silicon Carbide surface looks smooth and restored.
    It maintains strong material integrity, and shows no damage for reliable semiconductor
    use.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of sintered silicon carbide is significantly
          higher than its tensile or flexural strength. Authoritative materials databases
          like MatWeb and supplier technical data sheets for sintered alpha SiC consistently
          report compressive strength values in the range of 3.8-4.1 GPa (3800-4100
          MPa). The provided value of 3900 MPa is a typical, well-cited average for
          high-purity, dense sintered SiC under standard test conditions (room temperature,
          uniaxial loading).

          alkalis, and saline solutions at elevated temperatures, with only concentrated
          hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, and strong alkalis at high temperatures
          causing significant attack. This places it among the most corrosion-resistant
          engineering ceramics.

          break down, and active oxidation or significant material degradation begins.
          This value is widely cited in ceramic and composite materials literature
          as the maximum continuous service temperature in air.
