  description: Microscopic analysis of Float Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the float glass surface appears very-very contaminated
    with fine dust particles and oily residues that stick and spread unevenly. Contaminants
    show irregular shapes, so surface degradation includes tiny pits and scratches
    that make texture rough and light-scattering.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the float glass surface appears very-very
    smooth and pristine. Contaminants are removed thoroughly, then the surface is
    restored to original clarity without scratches. Material integrity is preserved
    fully, so no structural damage occurs. This ensures high restoration quality for
    everyday glass applications.
