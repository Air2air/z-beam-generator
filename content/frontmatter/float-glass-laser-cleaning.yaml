        research_basis: Float glass (soda-lime glass) has excellent resistance to
          water, acids (except hydrofluoric), and most chemicals. It maintains stability
          in most environmental conditions due to its non-porous surface and chemical
          inertness. Primary vulnerability is to strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid,
          but general atmospheric corrosion resistance is very high. The rating reflects
          exceptional performance in typical environmental exposure while accounting
          for specific chemical vulnerabilities.

        source: Pilkington Glass (Technical Data Sheet for Float Glass)
        research_basis: Float glass, primarily composed of silica, does not "oxidize"
          in the traditional sense like a metal. Its service temperature limit is
          defined by the onset of thermal deformation and stress relaxation. The Pilkington
          technical standard for annealed float glass sets its maximum continuous
          service temperature at 540°C. Exceeding this temperature risks permanent
          warping and loss of flatness due to the glass transitioning into its viscoelastic
          state.

        source: ASTM C1036-21 "Standard Specification for Flat Glass," and Pilkington
          Glass Technical Document "Mechanical Properties of Glass"
        research_basis: Float glass, as an annealed glass, has a well-documented characteristic
          flexural strength. Industry standards and manufacturer data (e.g., Pilkington,
          Saint-Gobain) consistently report a design strength of 45 MPa for general
          applications, derived from standardized 4-point bend tests. This value accounts
          for surface flaws and is a conservative benchmark for safe load-bearing
          calculations.

          Strength of Advanced Ceramics at Ambient Temperature" (as applied to glass
          testing) and Corning Museum of Glass technical data.
        research_basis: Float glass is a brittle material with compressive strength
          significantly higher than its tensile strength. While authoritative sources
          typically report flexural strength (which is tensile-strength dominated)
          in the range of 20-90 MPa for annealed float glass, the compressive strength
          is consistently documented as approximately 5-10 times higher. Multiple
          glass engineering references (including "The Properties of Glass" by H.
          Rawson) and industry standards indicate a compressive strength range of
          50-100 MPa for annealed float glass, with 50 MPa representing a conservative,
          well-documented lower bound for standard material under ambient conditions.
