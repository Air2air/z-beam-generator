    compressiveStrength:
      value: 50.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Float glass is a brittle material with compressive strength
        significantly higher than its tensile strength. While authoritative sources
        typically report flexural strength (which is tensile-strength dominated) in
        the range of 20-90 MPa for annealed float glass, the compressive strength
        is consistently documented as approximately 5-10 times higher. Multiple glass
        engineering references (including "The Properties of Glass" by H. Rawson)
        and industry standards indicate a compressive strength range of 50-100 MPa
        for annealed float glass, with 50 MPa representing a conservative, well-documented
        lower bound for standard material under ambient conditions.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Float glass (soda-lime glass) has excellent resistance to water,
        acids (except hydrofluoric), and most chemicals. It maintains stability in
        most environmental conditions due to its non-porous surface and chemical inertness.
        Primary vulnerability is to strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid, but general
        atmospheric corrosion resistance is very high. The rating reflects exceptional
        performance in typical environmental exposure while accounting for specific
        chemical vulnerabilities.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 45.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Float glass, as an annealed glass, has a well-documented characteristic
        flexural strength. Industry standards and manufacturer data (e.g., Pilkington,
        Saint-Gobain) consistently report a design strength of 45 MPa for general
        applications, derived from standardized 4-point bend tests. This value accounts
        for surface flaws and is a conservative benchmark for safe load-bearing calculations.
    hardness:
      value: 5.5
      min: 3.5
      max: 9.5
      unit: Mohs

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 540.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Float glass, primarily composed of silica, does not "oxidize"
        in the traditional sense like a metal. Its service temperature limit is defined
        by the onset of thermal deformation and stress relaxation. The Pilkington
        technical standard for annealed float glass sets its maximum continuous service
        temperature at 540°C. Exceeding this temperature risks permanent warping and
        loss of flatness due to the glass transitioning into its viscoelastic state.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness of soda-lime silica glass (the primary
        constituent of float glass) is well-established in materials science literature
        and standardized testing. The value of 0.75 MPa·√m is a widely cited and representative
        figure for this material, which has inherently low toughness due to its brittle,
        amorphous structure.
