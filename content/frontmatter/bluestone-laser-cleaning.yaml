caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the bluestone surface displays a densely
    contaminated state, with irregular pores filled by fine dust particles and organic
    biofilms. These contaminants, they exhibit adhesive properties, fostering microbial
    growth. Consequently, surface degradation appears as etched micro-fissures and
    subtle discoloration, weakening the stone's natural durability.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the bluestone surface emerges restored to its original
    luster, with contaminants removed precisely without altering the stone's natural
    patina. This treatment ensures a smooth, even condition, free from residues or
    discoloration, while preserving material integrity—no microcracks or erosion observed.
    The restoration quality proves exceptional, enhancing durability for architectural
    applications.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with a dense, fine-grained sandstone or basalt, both of which are sometimes
          marketed as "Bluestone." The stated value of 180 MPa is a conservative,
          widely cited average for commercial bluestone (typically a feldspathic sandstone)
          used in construction, as per industry design manuals. However, "Bluestone"
          is a commercial name, and its compressive strength can vary significantly
          (typically 100-300 MPa) based on its specific geological formation and quarry
          location.

        research_basis: Bluestone (a dense quartzitic sandstone/graywacke) exhibits
          excellent corrosion resistance due to its high quartz content (hardness
          3.8 Mohs indicates substantial quartz), low porosity, and dense crystalline
          structure. Natural stone industry standards rate dense quartz-based stones
          as having very high resistance to environmental weathering, acid rain, and
          chemical degradation. The material properties align with granite/sandstone
          classifications known for superior durability in architectural applications.

          a pure chemical compound, its primary mineral components (e.g., quartz,
          feldspars) begin to experience significant oxidative degradation and structural
          weakening around 600°C in air. This temperature is cited in standards for
          natural building stones like granite and basalt as a safe upper limit for
          continuous service before mineralogical changes and loss of structural integrity
          occur.
