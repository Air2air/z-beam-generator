caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the alumina surface shows dense particulate contamination,
    with irregular oily residues causing pitting and erosion in the ceramic structure.
  afterText: In laser cleaning of alumina ceramics, the surface emerges pristine and
    uniform, free from contaminants like oxides or residues that compromise its dielectric
    strength and thermal stability. This restoration, achieved through precise ablation,
    revives the original microstructure without inducing cracks or phase changes.
    Material integrity remains intact, ensuring the ceramic's hardness and wear resistance
    for demanding applications in electronics and aerospace.

          It does not undergo further oxidation, so its "oxidation resistance temperature"
          is effectively its maximum use temperature in air, which is limited by creep
          and sintering rather than oxidation. Authoritative handbooks (ASM, Engineered
          Materials Handbook) consistently place this maximum continuous service temperature
          between 1700°C and 1950°C, with 1900°C being a commonly cited upper limit
          for high-purity, dense alumina before significant deformation occurs.
