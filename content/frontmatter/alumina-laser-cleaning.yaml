  description: Microscopic analysis of Alumina surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the alumina surface shows dense particulate contamination,
    with irregular oily residues causing pitting and erosion in the ceramic structure.
  afterText: In laser cleaning of alumina ceramics, the surface emerges pristine and
    uniform, free from contaminants like oxides or residues that compromise its dielectric
    strength and thermal stability. This restoration, achieved through precise ablation,
    revives the original microstructure without inducing cracks or phase changes.
    Material integrity remains intact, ensuring the ceramic's hardness and wear resistance
    for demanding applications in electronics and aerospace.
