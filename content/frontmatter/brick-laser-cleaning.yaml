  beforeText: Under microscopy, brick surfaces reveal clustered dirt particles and
    oily residues, leading to pitting and faded coloration. This degradation complicates
    laser-based cleaning in restoration projects.
  afterText: After thorough cleaning, the brick surface emerges smooth and vibrant,
    with restored original color and texture that preserves material integrity. No
    erosion or weakening occurs, maintaining structural strength for masonry in commercial
    facades.

          attack in normal environments. The material's high compressive strength
          (41.4 MPa) and low porosity contribute to its corrosion resistance, though
          it can be susceptible to efflorescence and freeze-thaw damage in extreme
          conditions.

        research_basis: For fired clay brick, a well-established empirical relationship
          exists where the flexural strength (modulus of rupture) is typically 1/6th
          of the compressive strength. Given the provided compressive strength of
          41.4 MPa, this ratio yields a value of 6.9 MPa. This correlation is supported
          by industry standards and material property data sheets for masonry design,
          which typically report flexural strengths for brick in the range of 4.8
          to 8.3 MPa, with 6.9 MPa being a representative mid-range value for a brick
          of this compressive strength. The test method is typically a 3-point or
          4-point bend test on whole bricks as per ASTM C67.

        research_basis: Brick is a fired clay ceramic. Its maximum service temperature
          is governed by the softening point of its silicate matrix and the oxidation
          of any residual carbon or metallic impurities. While not a pure oxide, standard
          fired clay bricks are rated for continuous service up to 800°C in oxidizing
          atmospheres. Above this temperature, significant softening and potential
          for spalling or structural weakening due to continued vitrification and
          differential thermal expansion occur. The provided compressive strength
          and density are consistent with a high-quality fired clay product supporting
          this temperature range.
