      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Brick is highly resistant to environmental corrosion due to
        its ceramic composition and firing process. ASTM standards note brick's exceptional
        durability against atmospheric degradation, moisture, and chemical attack
        in normal environments. The material's high compressive strength (41.4 MPa)
        and low porosity contribute to its corrosion resistance, though it can be
        susceptible to efflorescence and freeze-thaw damage in extreme conditions.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 6.9
      min: 2
      max: 20
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: For fired clay brick, a well-established empirical relationship
        exists where the flexural strength (modulus of rupture) is typically 1/6th
        of the compressive strength. Given the provided compressive strength of 41.4
        MPa, this ratio yields a value of 6.9 MPa. This correlation is supported by
        industry standards and material property data sheets for masonry design, which
        typically report flexural strengths for brick in the range of 4.8 to 8.3 MPa,
        with 6.9 MPa being a representative mid-range value for a brick of this compressive
        strength. The test method is typically a 3-point or 4-point bend test on whole
        bricks as per ASTM C67.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 800.0
      min: 300.0
      max: 1200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Brick is a fired clay ceramic. Its maximum service temperature
        is governed by the softening point of its silicate matrix and the oxidation
        of any residual carbon or metallic impurities. While not a pure oxide, standard
        fired clay bricks are rated for continuous service up to 800°C in oxidizing
        atmospheres. Above this temperature, significant softening and potential for
        spalling or structural weakening due to continued vitrification and differential
        thermal expansion occur. The provided compressive strength and density are
        consistent with a high-quality fired clay product supporting this temperature
        range.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.8
      min: 0.15
      max: 1.1
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Brick, as a quasibrittle masonry material, has fracture toughness
        values typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 MPa·√m. Based on compilations of
        fracture properties for construction materials, common brick falls in the
        lower end of this range, with 0.8 MPa·√m being a representative median value
        cited for standard fired clay brick. This value is consistent with the material's
        known compressive strength of 41.4 MPa and brittle ceramic-like behavior.
