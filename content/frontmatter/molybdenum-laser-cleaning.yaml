  beforeText: Under microscopy, the molybdenum surface reveals heavy contamination
    with dark oxide particles and oily residues. This causes pitting and rough texture,
    degrading its smoothness and integrity.
  afterText: Using laser cleaning, molybdenum surfaces restore to a smooth, contaminant-free
    condition. This surface, it shows uniform texture and no residue, demonstrating
    high restoration quality. Material integrity stays intact, with original strength
    and conductivity preserved for general applications.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, recrystallized molybdenum
          is significantly lower than its tensile strength at room temperature. The
          ASM Handbook, a highly authoritative source for material properties, provides
          a typical value of 550 MPa (80 ksi) for the compressive yield strength,
          which is the standard measure for compressive strength. This value is for
          annealed material at room temperature. The hardness (1500 MPa) is not a
          direct indicator of compressive strength, as it measures a different type
          of surface deformation.

        research_basis: Molybdenum has good resistance to many acids (HCl, sulfuric)
          and molten metals, but poor oxidation resistance above ~500°C in air and
          is susceptible to pitting in oxidizing environments like nitric acid. This
          mixed performance in general environments places it in the mid-range of
          the corrosion resistance scale.

        research_basis: The provided flexural strength is a typical minimum value
          for recrystallized molybdenum. The ASM Handbook is a premier reference for
          material properties. However, the flexural strength of molybdenum is highly
          dependent on its processing (e.g., powder metallurgy vs. arc-cast), purity,
          grain structure (worked vs. recrystallized), and temperature. At room temperature,
          values can range from approximately 345 MPa for recrystallized material
          to over 700 MPa for stress-relieved, worked material. This variability,
          while common for metals, is the primary reason the confidence is not higher.

          in air at temperatures as low as 300-400°C. Above 400°C, the oxide (MoO₃)
          is volatile and does not form a protective scale, leading to rapid, catastrophic
          oxidation. The 400°C value is widely cited in materials handbooks as the
          maximum continuous service temperature in an oxidizing environment.
