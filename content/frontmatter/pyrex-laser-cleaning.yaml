  description: Microscopic analysis of Pyrex surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the Pyrex surface displays a contaminated condition
    marked by clustered particulates and oily residues. These contaminants, fine dust
    and hydrocarbon films, adhere unevenly, forming hazy domains that obscure the
    glass's clarity. Surface degradation manifests in micro-pitting and faint cracks,
    eroding the material's smooth integrity and signaling potential long-term weakening.
  afterText: After meticulous cleaning, the Pyrex surface emerges pristine, with its
    inherent transparency fully restored. This clarity, it reveals no residual contaminants
    or micro-abrasions, ensuring optical purity akin to the original state. The restoration
    quality excels, preserving the glass's thermal resistance and structural integrity
    without compromising its borosilicate composition. For general applications, such
    as laboratory use, this condition guarantees reliable performance and longevity.

  damage
