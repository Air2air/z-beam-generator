  beforeText: Under the microscope, the Pyrex surface displays a contaminated condition
    marked by clustered particulates and oily residues. These contaminants, fine dust
    and hydrocarbon films, adhere unevenly, forming hazy domains that obscure the
    glass's clarity. Surface degradation manifests in micro-pitting and faint cracks,
    eroding the material's smooth integrity and signaling potential long-term weakening.
  afterText: After meticulous cleaning, the Pyrex surface emerges pristine, with its
    inherent transparency fully restored. This clarity, it reveals no residual contaminants
    or micro-abrasions, ensuring optical purity akin to the original state. The restoration
    quality excels, preserving the glass's thermal resistance and structural integrity
    without compromising its borosilicate composition. For general applications, such
    as laboratory use, this condition guarantees reliable performance and longevity.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of glass is significantly higher
          than its tensile strength. For borosilicate glass like Pyrex, authoritative
          manufacturer data from Corning specifies a typical compressive strength
          of 1 GPa (1000 MPa). This value is a standard reference for the material's
          failure point under a crushing load.
