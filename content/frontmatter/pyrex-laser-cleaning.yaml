caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the Pyrex surface displays a contaminated condition marked by clustered particulates and
    oily residues. These contaminants, fine dust and hydrocarbon films, adhere unevenly, forming hazy domains that obscure
    the glass's clarity. Surface degradation manifests in micro-pitting and faint cracks, eroding the material's smooth integrity
    and signaling potential long-term weakening.
  afterText: After meticulous cleaning, the Pyrex surface emerges pristine, with its inherent transparency fully restored.
    This clarity, it reveals no residual contaminants or micro-abrasions, ensuring optical purity akin to the original state.
    The restoration quality excels, preserving the glass's thermal resistance and structural integrity without compromising
    its borosilicate composition. For general applications, such as laboratory use, this condition guarantees reliable performance
    and longevity.

faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for cleaning contaminants from Pyrex
    without damaging the surface?
  answer: For Pyrex cleaning, employ a 1064 nm wavelength with ~25 W average power and 100 ns pulses. Maintain fluence below
    2.5 J/cm² to selectively remove organics and particulates without micro-cracking the substrate, as this wavelength is
    poorly absorbed by the pristine glass. A 50 μm spot size scanned at 500 mm/s ensures effective, non-damaging results.
- question: Can laser cleaning create micro-fractures or induce thermal stress in Pyrex, and how can this be prevented?
  answer: Yes, Pyrex's low thermal expansion makes it vulnerable to microfractures from excessive fluence. We prevent this
    using nanosecond pulses at 2.5 J/cm² and a 50 μm spot size. A defocused beam or thin water film further manages thermal
    stress, ensuring the integrity of your precision components.
- question: Is it safe to use a laser to remove labels, adhesives, or paint from Pyrex laboratory glassware?
  answer: Properly configured laser cleaning at 1064nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence safely removes labels from Pyrex.
    This process vaporizes adhesives without chemical residue, preserving the material's optical clarity and structural integrity
    for laboratory applications.
- question: How does laser cleaning affect the optical properties and surface roughness of Pyrex?
  answer: Properly calibrated laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence maintains Pyrex's optical clarity. This process avoids surface
    hazing and minimizes roughness changes, ensuring high transmission with negligible light scattering for demanding optical
    applications.
- question: What are the primary safety hazards when laser cleaning Pyrex, and what PPE is required?
  answer: Thermal shock from exceeding 2.5 J/cm² can shatter Pyrex. The 1064 nm wavelength requires IR-specific laser safety
    eyewear. Hazardous glass and coating particulates necessitate a properly fitted respirator to protect against inhalation.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a Pyrex surface for high-vacuum or thin-film deposition applications?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively prepares Pyrex for high-vacuum applications. Using a 1064 nm wavelength at ~2.5
    J/cm² removes contaminants and activates the surface without subsurface damage, outperforming solvent methods for superior
    thin-film adhesion.
- question: Why is a pulsed fiber laser often recommended for cleaning Pyrex over a continuous-wave (CW) laser?
  answer: Pulsed fiber lasers, typically at 1064 nm wavelength, provide nanosecond pulses that enable precise thermal control.
    This prevents heat diffusion into the Pyrex bulk, crucial as its low thermal conductivity makes it susceptible to thermal
    shock from continuous-wave exposure.
- question: What is the best method to verify the effectiveness and safety of laser cleaning on Pyrex?
  answer: First, inspect under 50× magnification for micro-cracks. For critical flatness in optics, use white-light interferometry
    to verify surface roughness remains below 10 nm Ra. Finally, conduct a helium leak test to ensure integrity for vacuum
    systems, confirming the 2.5 J/cm² fluence didn't compromise the material.
- question: How do you clean deeply embedded metallic stains or diffusion layers from Pyrex with a laser?
  answer: For deeply embedded metallic stains in Pyrex, we use a multi-step approach. First, a 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm²
    fluence selectively vaporizes the surface contaminant. A subsequent, gentler pass then removes any remaining diffusion
    layer without exceeding the ablation threshold of the Pyrex substrate itself.
