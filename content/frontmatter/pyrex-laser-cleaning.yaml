    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1000.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of glass is significantly higher than
        its tensile strength. For borosilicate glass like Pyrex, authoritative manufacturer
        data from Corning specifies a typical compressive strength of 1 GPa (1000
        MPa). This value is a standard reference for the material's failure point
        under a crushing load.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Pyrex borosilicate glass exhibits excellent chemical durability
        against water, acids, salt solutions, and halogens. It maintains stability
        in most environments except strong alkalis and hydrofluoric acid, where it
        shows moderate corrosion. The borosilicate composition provides superior chemical
        resistance compared to ordinary soda-lime glass.

      value: 69.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The manufacturer's technical data sheet is the definitive source
        for this property. It lists the modulus of rupture (a measure of flexural
        strength) for annealed Pyrex 7740 glass as 69 MPa, determined by a standard
        4-point bend test method (ASTM C158). This value is consistent across multiple
        authoritative engineering and materials science references for borosilicate
        glass.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 500.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for Pyrex 7740 borosilicate
        glass in air is consistently cited as 500°C by its primary manufacturer, Corning.
        This is not an oxidation temperature in the metallic sense, but the temperature
        at which the glass begins to undergo significant thermal deformation and chemical
        degradation, which is the relevant failure mode for this material class.

      research_basis: Pyrex, a borosilicate glass, has low fracture toughness typical
        of oxide glasses. Published values for borosilicate glass generally range
        from 0.70 to 0.85 MPa·√m, with 0.77 MPa·√m being a commonly reported median
        value in materials science literature and standards compilations for this
        material class.
