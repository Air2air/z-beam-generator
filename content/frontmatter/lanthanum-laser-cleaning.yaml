faq:
- question: Can a standard laser cleaning machine safely remove lanthanum oxide scale or contamination from components?
  answer: A standard 1064nm laser system can effectively remove lanthanum oxide scale, but requires precise fluence control
    near the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold. Its high absorption coefficient of 0.85 facilitates efficient cleaning, yet the
    low thermal conductivity of 13.4 W/(m·K) demands careful parameterization to prevent localized thermal effects and potential
    surface modification.
- question: What are the specific safety hazards of laser cleaning lanthanum or lanthanum-containing alloys?
  answer: Lanthanum's low 200°C oxidation threshold means laser cleaning readily generates hazardous oxide fumes. At our standard
    2.5 J/cm² fluence, you require a P100 particulate filter and powerful fume extraction. The fine, reactive particles necessitate
    this robust respiratory and ventilation control to mitigate inhalation risks.
- question: What is the best laser parameter setup (wavelength, power, pulse width) for cleaning lanthanum without damaging
    the substrate?
  answer: For lanthanum's high 85% absorptivity, use a 1064 nm wavelength at 90 W average power. Maintain fluence just above
    the 2.8 J/cm² ablation threshold with 12 ns pulses to remove oxides without melting the soft substrate, leveraging its
    low thermal conductivity.
- question: Does laser cleaning create a passivation layer on lanthanum metal, and is it desirable?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence does create a thin lanthanum oxide passivation layer. This is highly desirable,
    as it significantly improves the material's corrosion resistance, which is otherwise limited below 200°C, enhancing part
    longevity for subsequent applications.
- question: How do you verify the effectiveness of laser cleaning on lanthanum surfaces? What inspection methods are used?
  answer: We verify cleaning effectiveness using white light interferometry to confirm surface topography below 1 µm roughness.
    EDX analysis ensures oxide contaminants are reduced below 200 ppm, while a uniform matte finish at 2.5 J/cm² fluence indicates
    successful ablation.
- question: Is lanthanum considered a 'rare earth' in laser cleaning safety protocols, and does it require special handling
    like thorium?
  answer: Lanthanum is indeed classified as a rare earth, but unlike radioactive thorium, it presents no radiological hazard.
    Standard laser safety protocols apply, using 1064 nm wavelength at 2.5 J/cm² fluence for oxide removal. The primary concern
    is managing the fine particulate generated during ablation.
- question: What are the common industrial parts made of lanthanum that might require laser cleaning?
  answer: In electronics manufacturing, we frequently clean lanthanum-containing hydrogen storage alloys and optical components
    like LaFN21 glass. Their oxide layers, forming above 200°C, are effectively removed using a 1064 nm laser at 2.5 J/cm²
    fluence without damaging the soft substrate.
- question: Why is lanthanum often a contaminant on other materials, and how is it removed with a laser?
  answer: Lanthanum oxide contamination often occurs from catalyst residues or glass polishing. We remove it using a 1064
    nm laser at 2.5 J/cm², a fluence just above its ablation threshold. This effectively vaporizes the oxide layer without
    damaging the underlying nickel alloy or stainless steel substrate.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to prepare a lanthanum surface for subsequent processes like coating or welding?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively prepares lanthanum surfaces using a 1064 nm wavelength and fluence near 2.5 J/cm². This
    process removes oxides while creating a slightly roughened, activated surface ideal for adhesion. The low thermal conductivity
    of 13.4 W/(m·K) ensures minimal heat input, preserving the substrate integrity for subsequent coating or welding.
- question: How does the high reactivity of fresh lanthanum metal affect post-laser cleaning handling and storage?
  answer: Freshly laser-cleaned lanthanum surfaces re-oxidize almost instantly in air due to the metal's high reactivity.
    To preserve the pristine surface achieved with 2.5 J/cm² fluence, you must immediately transfer the component into an
    argon glovebox or proceed with the next manufacturing step, like coating, without delay.
