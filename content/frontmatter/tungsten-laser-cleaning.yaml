caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy shows the tungsten surface contaminated by fine oxide particles
    and residues, causing pitting and rough texture. This degradation affects its
    precision in aerospace and electronics uses.
  afterText: The cleaned tungsten surface appears smooth and uniform, free from oxidation
    residues and contaminants. This restoration process preserves the metal's exceptional
    hardness and high melting point, ensuring no compromise to its integrity. It demonstrates
    reliable quality for demanding uses in aerospace and electronics manufacturing,
    where precision matters. And the finish supports long-term durability without
    altering core properties.
