caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the GFRP surface appears very-very rough and uneven,
    with contaminants like fine dust particles and oily residues clinging tightly
    to the fibers. These contaminants form irregular clusters, blocking matrix interfaces
    and causing discoloration. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and fiber
    pull-outs, so the material looks weakened and porous, then invites further damage
    if not cleaned promptly.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) appears
    very-very smooth and glossy, with contaminants fully removed then original texture
    restored. This process cleans effectively so material integrity remains intact—no
    delamination or fiber damage occurs. Restoration quality is high, as surface looks
    pristine and ready for applications, maintaining composite strength and durability.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of GFRP is highly dependent on the
          fiber architecture (e.g., unidirectional, fabric) and resin system. The
          cited military handbook, a key authority for composite material properties,
          provides a typical range of 140-200 MPa for quasi-isotropic laminates under
          standard test conditions (ASTM D6641). The value of 150 MPa is a conservative,
          representative figure from the lower end of this range for general-purpose
          GFRP.

      corrosionResistance:
        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.87
        research_basis: GFRP exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to a wide range
          of chemicals and environments, including water, salt solutions, acids, and
          alkalis, because the polymer matrix (typically epoxy or vinyl ester) is
          non-metallic and does not corrode electrochemically. It is widely used in
          corrosive industrial applications like chemical processing and marine structures.
          The rating is not a perfect 10 because it can suffer from degradation in
          strong acids/bases at elevated temperatures and potential issues like fiber
          etching or blistering in specific long-term exposures.

        research_basis: GFRP's maximum service temperature is primarily limited by
          the polymer matrix (typically polyester or epoxy). The MIL-HDBK-17 states
          that for these matrices in air, significant property degradation, including
          oxidation of the resin and loss of interfacial bond strength, begins around
          150°C. This temperature is well below the glass transition temperature (Tg)
          of high-temperature epoxies, as oxidative aging is the dominant failure
          mechanism in air.

        research_basis: GFRP fracture toughness is highly dependent on fiber orientation,

          composites in the fiber direction, K_IC typically ranges from 20-45 MPa·√m.
