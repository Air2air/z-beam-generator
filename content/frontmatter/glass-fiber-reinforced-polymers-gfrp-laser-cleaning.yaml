    thermalExpansion:
      value: 18.5
      unit: μm/m·°C

        Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers, Table: Thermal Expansion Coefficients for
        GFRP with 60-70% E-glass fiber content in epoxy matrix'
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 150.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of GFRP is highly dependent on the
        fiber architecture (e.g., unidirectional, fabric) and resin system. The cited
        military handbook, a key authority for composite material properties, provides
        a typical range of 140-200 MPa for quasi-isotropic laminates under standard
        test conditions (ASTM D6641). The value of 150 MPa is a conservative, representative
        figure from the lower end of this range for general-purpose GFRP.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: GFRP exhibits excellent corrosion resistance to a wide range
        of chemicals and environments, including water, salt solutions, acids, and
        alkalis, because the polymer matrix (typically epoxy or vinyl ester) is non-metallic
        and does not corrode electrochemically. It is widely used in corrosive industrial
        applications like chemical processing and marine structures. The rating is
        not a perfect 10 because it can suffer from degradation in strong acids/bases
        at elevated temperatures and potential issues like fiber etching or blistering
        in specific long-term exposures.
    density:
      value: 1.9
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Specific data for E-glass
        fiber reinforced epoxy with ~60% fiber volume fraction, a common industrial
        GFRP formulation.'

      value: 120000000000000.0
      unit: Ω·m
      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 483.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        a standard E-glass/epoxy composite. Authoritative engineering databases (ASM,
        CES EduPack) report flexural strengths for this material category in the range
        of 350-600 MPa, with a typical value for a high-performance, unidirectional
        laminate being approximately 483 MPa. This value is determined via a standard
        3-point bend test (ASTM D790).
    hardness:
      value: 85.0
      unit: HRR
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Section: Mechanical Properties
        of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers, Rockwell R scale testing per ASTM D785'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: GFRP's maximum service temperature is primarily limited by the
        polymer matrix (typically polyester or epoxy). The MIL-HDBK-17 states that
        for these matrices in air, significant property degradation, including oxidation
        of the resin and loss of interfacial bond strength, begins around 150°C. This
        temperature is well below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of high-temperature
        epoxies, as oxidative aging is the dominant failure mechanism in air.
    tensileStrength:
      value: 3100.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Table ''Typical Mechanical
        Properties of Unidirectional Glass Fiber/Epoxy Composites'' specifying tensile
        strength range of 1000-3100 MPa for continuous fiber composites with 60-70%
        fiber volume fraction'
    youngsModulus:
      value: 40.0
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Table ''Mechanical Properties
        of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers'' citing specific E-glass/epoxy composites
        with 60-70% fiber volume fraction'
    fractureToughness:
      value: 30.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: GFRP fracture toughness is highly dependent on fiber orientation,
        volume fraction, and matrix properties. For continuous glass fiber/epoxy composites
        in the fiber direction, K_IC typically ranges from 20-45 MPa·√m. The cited
        value represents a conservative mid-range estimate for structural GFRP laminates,
        consistent with handbook values for epoxy-based composites with 50-60% fiber
        volume fraction.
