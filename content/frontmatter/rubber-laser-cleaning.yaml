caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the rubber composite surface appears uneven, with
    embedded dust particles and oily residues causing localized pitting and micro-cracks.
    This degradation weakens material integrity, as seen in laser optics cleaning
    tools where contaminants accelerate wear during routine surface wiping.
  afterText: After thorough cleaning, the rubber composite surface restores to a smooth,
    residue-free state, eliminating contaminants that could scatter laser light. Restoration
    quality excels, returning the material to its original elasticity and tensile
    strength without compromising integrity—no cracks, swelling, or degradation occur.
    In optical laser system seals, this upholds precise alignment and durability for
    reliable operation.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of rubber is not a single fixed value
          but is highly dependent on its hardness (provided as 60 Shore A). For a
          60 Shore A elastomer, typical compressive strength ranges from 15-25 MPa.
          The value of 20 MPa represents a standard mid-range value for this hardness
          under standard test conditions (ASTM D575, room temperature).

          EPDM) exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range of environmental factors
          including water, ozone, and weathering. It is highly resistant to galvanic
          corrosion and many dilute chemicals, though resistance varies by specific
          rubber type and can be degraded by oils, strong oxidizers, and prolonged
          UV exposure. The high rating reflects its general superior performance against
          atmospheric and aqueous corrosion compared to metals.

          of 60 Shore A, a typical flexural strength value is in the range of 3-7
