    compressiveStrength:
      value: 20.0
      min: 50
      max: 1000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of rubber is not a single fixed value
        but is highly dependent on its hardness (provided as 60 Shore A). For a 60
        Shore A elastomer, typical compressive strength ranges from 15-25 MPa. The
        value of 20 MPa represents a standard mid-range value for this hardness under
        standard test conditions (ASTM D575, room temperature).
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 5
      max: 9
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Rubber (particularly general-purpose elastomers like Nitrile,
        EPDM) exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range of environmental factors
        including water, ozone, and weathering. It is highly resistant to galvanic
        corrosion and many dilute chemicals, though resistance varies by specific
        rubber type and can be degraded by oils, strong oxidizers, and prolonged UV
        exposure. The high rating reflects its general superior performance against
        atmospheric and aqueous corrosion compared to metals.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 5.0
      min: 100
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of rubber is highly dependent on its specific
        formulation and hardness. For a general-purpose rubber with a hardness of
        60 Shore A, a typical flexural strength value is in the range of 3-7 MPa.
        The provided value of 5.0 MPa is a representative median for this hardness
        level, as cited by materials science databases and engineering handbooks.

        - Typical hardness values for carbon black-filled natural rubber compounds
        used in industrial applications range from 55-65 Shore A, with 60 Shore A
        being the most common specification for laser-cleaning applications'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 100.0
      min: 80.0
      max: 1650.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: General-purpose rubber materials (like natural rubber or SBR)
        typically have a maximum continuous service temperature in air in the range
        of 80-100°C before significant oxidative degradation begins. The provided
        hardness (60 Shore A) is consistent with these common, non-specialty elastomers,
        which have limited heat resistance.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.05
      min: 20
      max: 100
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Fracture toughness (K_IC) for rubber materials is typically
        very low (0.01-0.1 MPa·√m) due to their high elasticity and ability to undergo
        large deformations without crack propagation. The cited reference provides
        typical values for unfilled and filled rubber compounds in this range, with
        0.05 MPa·√m being representative for many rubber formulations.
