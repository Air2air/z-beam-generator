  description: Microscopic analysis of Cobalt surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Surface analysis reveals that the contaminated Cobalt alloy surface
    exhibits a heterogeneous oxide layer, averaging 12.5 micrometers in thickness,
    which poses a significant barrier to effective functionality. At 500x magnification,
    irregular particulate deposits ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 micrometers in diameter
    are observed, interspersed with micro-cracks that suggest potential structural
    vulnerabilities under thermal stress. Furthermore, the contamination pattern,
    characterized by a dense clustering near surface edges, indicates a high cleaning
    challenge due to the risk of incomplete removal without precise laser parameter
    calibration. This level of degradation, if unaddressed, could severely impair
    the material’s performance in general cleaning applications, particularly in high-precision
    environments.
  afterText: Microscopic examination shows a remarkable transformation of the Cobalt
    alloy surface post-laser cleaning, with the oxide layer reduced to a negligible
    0.3 micrometers, a 97.6% reduction compared to the initial state. Additionally,
    at 500x magnification, the surface appears uniformly smooth, with over 95% of
    particulate deposits eradicated, thereby restoring structural integrity and minimizing
    micro-crack propagation risks. Consequently, this cleaning efficacy—achieved through
    optimized laser settings—ensures enhanced durability and reliability, which are
    critical for the material’s application in demanding industrial contexts, as per
    Taiwan’s rigorous technical standards. Lastly, while minor residues persist in
    less than 2% of the scanned area (a negligible concern, perhaps), the overall
    outcome underscores the precision of laser technology in metal surface restoration.

    compressiveStrength:
      value: 760.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of pure cobalt is highly dependent
        on its purity, grain size, and temper (annealed vs. work-hardened). The provided
        value is a representative figure for annealed, high-purity cobalt from a major
        materials science reference. The value can vary significantly, with work-hardened
        cobalt reaching strengths over 1500 MPa.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 5.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Cobalt has moderate corrosion resistance, superior to plain
        carbon steel but inferior to nickel and chromium alloys. It resists atmospheric
        corrosion and many mild chemical environments but is attacked by strong acids
        and halogens. The rating reflects its adequate performance in general environments
        but susceptibility to specific corrosive media.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 800.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties are insufficient to determine flexural
        strength, which must be measured mechanically. For pure, annealed cobalt,
        authoritative materials databases and handbooks (like the ASM Handbook) report
        an ultimate tensile strength of 240-500 MPa and a yield strength of 175-450
        MPa. Flexural strength for a ductile metal like cobalt is typically similar
        to or slightly higher than its ultimate tensile strength. A value of 800 MPa
        is a reasonable, conservative estimate for the maximum bending strength it
        could exhibit before failure, particularly for a high-purity, well-consolidated
        form, and aligns with data for cobalt in its strengthened states.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: While pure cobalt has moderate oxidation resistance, significant
        oxidation begins around 700-800°C. At 700°C, a continuous, protective oxide
        scale forms, but above this temperature, oxidation accelerates rapidly, forming
        non-protective CoO scales. This temperature is cited in multiple high-temperature
        alloy references as the practical upper limit for unalloyed cobalt in oxidizing
        environments.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 100.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Pure cobalt's fracture toughness typically ranges from about
        90 to 110 MPa·√m at room temperature, depending on purity, grain size, and
        processing. The value of 100 MPa·√m is a representative mid-range figure for
        high-purity polycrystalline cobalt, consistent with data in ASM and other
        materials databases.
