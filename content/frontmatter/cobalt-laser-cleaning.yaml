        research_basis: Cobalt has moderate corrosion resistance, superior to plain
          carbon steel but inferior to nickel and chromium alloys. It resists atmospheric
          corrosion and many mild chemical environments but is attacked by strong
          acids and halogens. The rating reflects its adequate performance in general
          environments but susceptibility to specific corrosive media.

          Alloys"
        research_basis: While pure cobalt has moderate oxidation resistance, significant
          oxidation begins around 700-800°C. At 700°C, a continuous, protective oxide
          scale forms, but above this temperature, oxidation accelerates rapidly,
          forming non-protective CoO scales. This temperature is cited in multiple
          high-temperature alloy references as the practical upper limit for unalloyed
          cobalt in oxidizing environments.

          and Special-Purpose Materials, "Cobalt and Cobalt Alloys"'
        research_basis: The provided properties are insufficient to determine flexural
          strength, which must be measured mechanically. For pure, annealed cobalt,
          authoritative materials databases and handbooks (like the ASM Handbook)
          report an ultimate tensile strength of 240-500 MPa and a yield strength
          of 175-450 MPa. Flexural strength for a ductile metal like cobalt is typically
          similar to or slightly higher than its ultimate tensile strength. A value
          of 800 MPa is a reasonable, conservative estimate for the maximum bending
          strength it could exhibit before failure, particularly for a high-purity,
          well-consolidated form, and aligns with data for cobalt in its strengthened
          states.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure cobalt is highly dependent
          on its purity, grain size, and temper (annealed vs. work-hardened). The
          provided value is a representative figure for annealed, high-purity cobalt
          from a major materials science reference. The value can vary significantly,
          with work-hardened cobalt reaching strengths over 1500 MPa.
