    compressiveStrength:
      value: 60.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Bamboo's compressive strength is highly anisotropic and varies
        significantly with species, moisture content, and position along the culm
        (node vs. internode). The provided range of 40-80 MPa is well-established
        in composite and materials science literature for the longitudinal compressive
        strength of dry bamboo culm material, representing a consolidation of data
        from multiple standardized mechanical tests. The wide range accounts for natural
        variability.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Bamboo, while having good resistance to some environmental factors
        due to its silica content and natural waxes, has poor durability against fungal
        decay, insects, and moisture when untreated. It rates low on wood durability
        scales (Class 5 - not durable) with untreated bamboo typically lasting 1-3
        years in ground contact. Proper treatment can improve resistance, but base
        material has limited corrosion resistance comparable to other non-durable
        woods.

      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: This peer-reviewed study directly tested Bambusa vulgaris in
        a 3-point bend test, reporting a mean modulus of rupture (MOR), which is the
        flexural strength, of 140 MPa. This value is consistent with the established
        range for bamboo (typically 100-200 MPa) and aligns with its known high hardness
        (1580 MPa) and low density (0.6 g/cm³), indicating a strong, lightweight material.
        The confidence is slightly tempered by natural variability between bamboo
        species and test conditions.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 204.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Bamboo, as a lignocellulosic material, follows wood pyrolysis
        principles where significant thermal degradation begins around 200°C. The
        cited ASTM standard for wood-based materials establishes that prolonged exposure
        above 200°C in air leads to oxidative degradation, charring, and measurable
        strength reduction. This temperature represents the threshold where chemical
        decomposition of lignin and hemicellulose components becomes significant under
        oxidative conditions.
