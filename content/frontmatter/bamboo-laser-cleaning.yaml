caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the bamboo surface appears heavily contaminated
    with fine particulate matter and organic residues, likely from environmental exposure.
    These contaminants, irregular in shape and clustered, adhere tightly to the fibrous
    texture, causing localized discoloration and minor pitting. This degradation weakens
    the wood's natural structure, highlighting the need for effective cleaning in
    processing applications.
  afterText: The cleaned bamboo surface now exhibits a smooth, even finish that restores
    its natural grain and color vibrancy. Laser processing removes dirt and residues
    precisely, and it avoids any thermal alteration to the wood fibers. This condition
    demonstrates excellent restoration quality, with the material's integrity fully
    intact—no cracks or weakening observed—ensuring durability for everyday cleaning
    uses.

        research_basis: Bamboo's compressive strength is highly anisotropic and varies
          significantly with species, moisture content, and position along the culm
          (node vs. internode). The provided range of 40-80 MPa is well-established
          in composite and materials science literature for the longitudinal compressive
          strength of dry bamboo culm material, representing a consolidation of data
          from multiple standardized mechanical tests. The wide range accounts for
          natural variability.

        research_basis: Bamboo, while having good resistance to some environmental
          factors due to its silica content and natural waxes, has poor durability
          against fungal decay, insects, and moisture when untreated. It rates low
          on wood durability scales (Class 5 - not durable) with untreated bamboo
          typically lasting 1-3 years in ground contact. Proper treatment can improve
          resistance, but base material has limited corrosion resistance comparable
          to other non-durable woods.

        research_basis: Bamboo, as a lignocellulosic material, follows wood pyrolysis
          principles where significant thermal degradation begins around 200°C. The
          cited ASTM standard for wood-based materials establishes that prolonged
          exposure above 200°C in air leads to oxidative degradation, charring, and
          measurable strength reduction. This temperature represents the threshold
          where chemical decomposition of lignin and hemicellulose components becomes
          significant under oxidative conditions.
