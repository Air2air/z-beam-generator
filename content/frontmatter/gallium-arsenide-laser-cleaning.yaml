subtitle: Laser cleaning parameters and specifications for Gallium Arsenide
description: Laser cleaning parameters for Gallium Arsenide
category: semiconductor
subcategory: elemental
caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the Gallium Arsenide surface shows heavy-very heavy
    contamination, with dark spots and irregular particles clinging tightly. Contaminants
    appear as oily residues and fine dust grains, causing surface roughness and small
    pits. The semiconductor layer degrades slowly, losing its smooth shine, so it
    looks dull and uneven. This condition weakens material performance in applications.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Gallium Arsenide surface appears
    very-very smooth and clean-clean, with contaminants removed then smoothness restored
    effectively. The process preserves material integrity, so semiconductor properties
    stay intact and unchanged. Restoration quality is high-high, making surface ready-ready
    for applications like electronics fabrication, without damage or defects.

          significant thermal oxidation leading to substantial material degradation
          begins in the 450-650°C range in air. The 600°C value is widely cited in
          semiconductor processing literature as the upper limit for avoiding rapid,
          destructive oxidation, as this is the temperature where arsenic starts to
          volatilize aggressively, leaving a non-protective, gallium-rich oxide layer.
