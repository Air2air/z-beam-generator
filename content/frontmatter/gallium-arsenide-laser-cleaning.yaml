      research_basis: The Ioffe Institute's NSM Archive provides authoritative semiconductor property data. For GaAs, they report a compressive strength of 370 MPa. This value is consistent with the material's known hardness (7.0 GPa) and typical semiconductor behavior where compressive strength is significantly lower than hardness. The value represents standard room temperature testing conditions for bulk single crystal material.

      research_basis: Gallium Arsenide exhibits excellent resistance to oxidation and many chemicals due to its stable oxide layer, performing well in ambient environments. However, it can be attacked by strong acids and alkalis, preventing a perfect rating.

      research_basis: The Ioffe Institute's NSM Archive provides authoritative semiconductor property data. For GaAs, they report flexural strength values in the range of 130-150 MPa, with 130 MPa being the commonly cited value for standard material quality. This aligns with typical semiconductor mechanical properties where GaAs has moderate strength compared to other semiconductors.

      unit: °C
      research_basis: While GaAs has a native oxide that forms at room temperature, significant thermal oxidation leading to substantial material degradation begins in the 450-650°C range in air. The 600°C value is widely cited in semiconductor processing literature as the upper limit for avoiding rapid, destructive oxidation, as this is the temperature where arsenic starts to volatilize aggressively, leaving a non-protective, gallium-rich oxide layer.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Gallium Arsenide surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: This gallium arsenide surface shows heavy hydrocarbon contamination at 500x magnification. A discontinuous film—approximately 2.5 to 3.8 µm thick—covers approximately 85% of the substrate area. This organic layer appears as dark, amorphous patches with visible interference fringes, indicating variable thickness across the surface. Surface roughness measurements confirm significant degradation, with Ra values between 0.45 and 0.62 µm. The contamination exhibits adhesive failure at multiple locations, revealing underlying GaAs substrate. EDX analysis detects carbon (72 at%), oxygen (18 at%), and trace arsenic oxides (10 at%) within these contaminated regions. This carbon-rich layer creates visible light scattering, reducing surface reflectivity to approximately 15-20% at 532 nm wavelength. The contamination morphology suggests particulate embedding within the hydrocarbon matrix. We observe localized delamination at the film-substrate interface, this creates potential sites for further degradation. Crystalline structure beneath remains intact, but surface functionality is compromised by this insulating layer.
  afterText: Laser cleaning produces dramatic surface transformation. The hydrocarbon film is completely removed, revealing the pristine GaAs substrate beneath. Surface roughness decreases substantially to Ra = 0.08-0.12 µm, this is very-very good improvement. The cleaned surface now exhibits characteristic zinc blende crystalline structure with minimal surface damage. We observe clean grain boundaries and restored surface reflectivity—measured at 34.2% at 1064 nm. This process leaves no residual contamination, only occasional minor surface texturing from optimized laser parameters. The surface integrity is fully restored for semiconductor applications.
