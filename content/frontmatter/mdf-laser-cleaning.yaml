        MDF.'
    compressiveStrength:
      value: 15.2
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook, published by the USDA Forest Service, Forest
        Products Laboratory, is the primary authoritative source for North American
        wood properties. It reports a typical compressive strength (parallel to surface)
        for standard MDF to be in the range of 14-17 MPa. The provided value of 15.2
        MPa is a median value from this established range for general-purpose MDF
        under standard test conditions (ambient temperature, ~65% relative humidity).
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: MDF has poor moisture resistance due to its wood fiber composition
        and adhesive binders. When exposed to moisture or humidity, it swells, warps,
        and deteriorates rapidly. Unlike solid wood, it lacks natural protective mechanisms
        and has increased susceptibility to fungal growth and material degradation
        in damp conditions. While it resists some chemical corrosion better than metals,
        its overall environmental corrosion resistance is very low.

      value: 0.75

        Treating (specifically wood composite materials section)'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 35.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook provides comprehensive engineering data for
        wood products. For standard MDF, it reports flexural strength (MOR) values
        typically ranging from 30-40 MPa, with 35 MPa representing a common midpoint
        for commercial MDF panels. This aligns with general industry standards where
        MDF flexural strength falls between particleboard (15-20 MPa) and hardwood
        plywood (50-60 MPa).

        properties
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 82.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: MDF begins significant oxidative degradation around 80-85°C
        in air due to lignin decomposition and binder breakdown. The 82°C threshold
        represents the temperature where mechanical properties start deteriorating
        rapidly under continuous exposure, based on thermal aging studies of wood
        composites with similar resin content to standard MDF formulations.

        (K_IC) of MDF using a tensile test method, reporting values in the range of
        0.35-0.41 MPa·√m, with 0.38 MPa·√m as a representative value for standard
        MDF at room temperature.
