caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, the MDF surface exhibits severe contamination
    with clustered dust particles, 10-40 microns in size, and oily residues infiltrating
    the wood fibers. This condition fosters degradation, evident in swollen, separated
    fibers and micro-pitting, compromising overall material integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the MDF surface gleams smooth and pristine, free
    from residues and imperfections. This restoration preserves the wood's structural
    integrity fully, with no charring or fiber damage observed. Quality remains excellent,
    ideal for subsequent coatings or assemblies.

          Products Laboratory, is the primary authoritative source for North American
          wood properties. It reports a typical compressive strength (parallel to
          surface) for standard MDF to be in the range of 14-17 MPa. The provided
          value of 15.2 MPa is a median value from this established range for general-purpose
          MDF under standard test conditions (ambient temperature, ~65% relative humidity).

        research_basis: MDF has poor moisture resistance due to its wood fiber composition
          and adhesive binders. When exposed to moisture or humidity, it swells, warps,
          and deteriorates rapidly. Unlike solid wood, it lacks natural protective
          mechanisms and has increased susceptibility to fungal growth and material
          degradation in damp conditions. While it resists some chemical corrosion
          better than metals, its overall environmental corrosion resistance is very
          low.
