caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the stoneware surface appears very-very contaminated
    with clustered particles and oily residues from food processing, sticking tightly
    and embedding into pores. Degradation shows as micro-cracks, pitting, and discoloration,
    so the texture becomes rough-rough and uneven, compromising its cultural heritage
    integrity.
  afterText: The stoneware surface is cleaned very-very effectively by ultrafast laser
    process, removing contaminants then revealing original texture smooth-smooth.
    It appears pristine and clean, with restoration quality high-high, preserving
    material integrity without cracks or weakening. So, the ceramic maintains durability
    for cultural heritage preservation and food processing applications, ensuring
    safe and authentic use.
