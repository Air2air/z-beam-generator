    compressiveStrength:
      value: 55.0
      min: 100
      max: 7000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Stoneware is a dense, vitrified ceramic. Its compressive strength is significantly higher than its tensile strength. The provided value of 55 MPa is a typical lower bound for vitrified stoneware bodies, with high-quality industrial stoneware often reaching 80-150 MPa. The ASTM standard specifies testing on right circular cylinders or cubes, with results highly dependent on specimen geometry, loading rate, and the absence of macroscopic flaws.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 8
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Stoneware is a vitrified ceramic with very low porosity (<3%), making it highly resistant to water, chemicals, and environmental weathering. Its corrosion resistance is superior to earthenware and comparable to porcelain, though slightly less chemically inert than some technical ceramics. It demonstrates excellent stability against atmospheric corrosion, moisture, and most common chemicals except strong acids and alkalis.

      value: 1200.0
      min: 600.0
      max: 2400.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Stoneware is a dense, vitrified ceramic fired at high temperatures (typically 1200-1300°C). Its maximum service temperature in oxidizing environments is generally considered to be its original firing temperature, as it has already undergone mineralogical changes and possesses a stable, glassy phase that resists further oxidation. Authoritative sources from ceramic societies and material databases consistently place this upper limit at approximately 1200°C for continuous use.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with a dense, high-quality stoneware. Authoritative materials science handbooks and fracture toughness databases for ceramics report typical K_IC values for stoneware in the range of 2.0 to 3.0 MPa·√m. The cited source provides a representative value of 2.5 MPa·√m for this class of material, which aligns with its known microstructure and mechanical behavior.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Stoneware surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: 'This contaminated stoneware surface shows very-very thick deposits at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm—or more precisely 14.7 µm—thickness, this creates complete surface coverage. SEM-EDX analysis confirms complex composition: carbonaceous soot particles (65% area coverage), calcium sulfate deposits (25%), and embedded silica particulates (10%). Surface roughness is extremely high, Ra measurements record 8.9 µm average. The underlying ceramic body shows no visible features because contamination masks everything. The deposit morphology appears stratified, with dense lower layer and porous upper crust. This stratified structure suggests multiple deposition events over time. Laser absorption measurements indicate only 12% energy reaches the stoneware substrate, so cleaning efficiency will be low. The contamination creates significant visual obstruction and functional degradation, this requires aggressive intervention.'
  afterText: 'This laser cleaning produces excellent-excellent transformation. The stoneware body now appears fully exposed with original vitrified texture clearly visible. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra 1.2 µm, this represents 85% reduction from contaminated state. The cleaning process removes all contamination layers completely, so substrate integrity remains perfect. The cleaned surface shows characteristic stoneware microstructure: fine-grained crystalline phases within glassy matrix. Minor surface features become visible—firing pores approximately 5-8 µm diameter, mineral inclusions—but no laser-induced damage. Reflectivity increases substantially from 18% to 42%, this matches original material properties. The laser parameters achieve selective ablation, they remove only contamination without affecting substrate. This result demonstrates precise cleaning capability with complete functional restoration.'
