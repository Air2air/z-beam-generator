caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, teak wood's contaminated surface reveals
    irregular pitting and micro-cracks from prolonged marine exposure, such as saltwater
    corrosion in yacht decking. Fine particulate contaminants—salt crystals and organic
    residues—cling to fiber bundles, accelerating degradation by weakening lignin
    bonds and promoting fungal hyphae growth. This leads to surface erosion, reducing
    structural integrity in aerospace paneling applications.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned teak surface exhibits a smooth, even finish with restored
    natural grain, free of contaminants. Restoration quality is high, preserving material
    integrity for marine decking applications without fiber damage.
