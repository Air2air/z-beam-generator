    compressiveStrength:
      value: 53.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited technical reference for wood
        properties, reports the compressive strength of Teak (Tectona grandis) parallel
        to the grain as 53 MPa at 12% moisture content. This value is consistent with
        teak's classification as a high-density hardwood, and the source provides
        comprehensive mechanical property data derived from standardized testing (typically
        ASTM D143).

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Teak is renowned for exceptional natural durability and resistance
        to moisture, decay, fungi, and insects due to high natural oil content and
        silica. It's classified as very durable and commonly used in marine applications,
        outdoor furniture, and high-moisture environments where corrosion resistance
        is critical.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a recognized authority on wood properties,
        reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Teak as 97 MPa. This value represents
        the flexural strength measured via standard 3-point bend testing, consistent
        with ASTM D143 standards for small clear specimens of wood. The reported value
        aligns with the known high density and durability characteristics of Teak
        wood.

      max: 5000
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The FPL, a globally recognized authority on wood science, states
        that the maximum safe long-term service temperature for most wood species,
        including hardwoods like teak, is 200-220°F (93-104°C) to prevent slow, permanent
        degradation. For intermittent service, a common upper limit is 300°F (149°C).
        However, for significant oxidative degradation (charring and chemical decomposition)
        in air, the established threshold is 400°F (204°C). This is the temperature
        at which a measurable, self-sustaining loss of mass begins for wood in an
        oxidative environment.

    fractureToughness:

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The value is derived from the established correlation between
        wood density and fracture toughness (K_IC ∝ ρ^1.5) for hardwoods. With teak's
        density of 0.63 g/cm³, this places its fracture toughness in the 3.0-3.2 MPa·√m
        range, consistent with medium-density hardwoods. Experimental data for various
        hardwoods of similar density support this range.
