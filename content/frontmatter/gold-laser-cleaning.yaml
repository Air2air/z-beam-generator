  beforeText: Gold surface looks very-very dirty under microscope. Contaminants appear dark and sticky. Surface is damaged
    and rough.
  afterText: The cleaned gold surface appears very-very smooth and shiny. The restoration process removes dirt then makes
    it look new. Surface is cleaned by laser method, so quality is high. Material integrity stays strong, and gold remains
    perfect for electronics, aerospace, and medical devices with no damage at all.

faq:
- question: Can a laser cleaning system remove tarnish or surface contamination from gold without damaging the underlying
    material?
  answer: Ya, sistem laser dapat membersihkan emas tanpa merusak substratnya. Dengan fluensi di bawah 0.8 J/cm² dan panjang
    gelombang 532 nm, kontaminasi permukaan seperti sulfida perak dapat dihilangkan secara selektif. Konduktivitas termal
    emas yang tinggi memungkinkan pendinginan cepat, mencegah pelelehan material dasar saat menggunakan pulsa nanodetik.
- question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm) for cleaning delicate gold surfaces, such as historical
    artifacts or electronics contacts?
  answer: For delicate gold surfaces, the optimal wavelength is 532 nm green light. Gold's reflectivity drops significantly
    at shorter wavelengths, enabling efficient ablation at lower fluence near 0.8 J/cm². This approach minimizes thermal damage
    risks to sensitive substrates like historical artifacts or electronics, ensuring precise contaminant removal.
- question: How do you prevent the high reflectivity of gold from causing safety issues or damaging the laser cleaning equipment
    itself?
  answer: We utilize a 532 nm wavelength for enhanced gold absorption, minimizing hazardous reflections. Critical safety measures
    include optical isolators and beam dumps to protect the 15 W laser source from back-reflected energy. Operators must wear
    wavelength-specific eyewear.
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for removing oxidation or fire scale from gold alloys (like 14k or 18k gold) after
    heat treatment or soldering?
  answer: Laser cleaning can remove oxidation from gold alloys, but selective ablation of alloying elements like copper is
    a concern. Using a 532 nm wavelength at 0.8 J/cm² fluence minimizes this risk, preserving the surface composition and
    color integrity.
- question: What are the risks of causing discoloration or a matte finish on a polished gold surface during laser cleaning?
  answer: Discoloration and matte finishes arise from micro-melting and surface roughening if fluence exceeds ~0.8 J/cm².
    Maintaining the specular reflection of polished gold requires precise control of parameters like the 50 µm spot size and
    500 mm/s scan speed to avoid altering its microstructure.
- question: Can laser cleaning be used to selectively de-plate gold from a substrate without harming the base material?
  answer: Ya, ablasi laser dapat secara selektif menghilangkan lapisan emas tanpa merusak substrat. Dengan fluence terkontrol
    sekitar 0.8 J/cm² dan panjang gelombang 532 nm, proses ini sangat efektif untuk aplikasi perbaikan PCB dan pemulihan logam
    mulia dari komponen elektronik bekas.
- question: How does the karat (purity) of gold affect the laser cleaning process and the parameters required?
  answer: Lower karat gold's higher copper content increases oxidation risk during laser cleaning. We must reduce the fluence
    below 0.8 J/cm² and adjust the 50 kHz repetition rate to prevent thermal damage to the more susceptible alloy, ensuring
    a pristine surface.
- question: What is the recommended method for verifying that a laser cleaning process on gold has not caused any measurable
    material loss or thinning?
  answer: Untuk memastikan tidak ada penipisan yang terukur, gunakan white light interferometry untuk mengukur topografi permukaan
    secara non-destruktif. Proses harus dijalankan di bawah fluens ablasi emas 0.8 J/cm² pada 532 nm untuk hanya menghilangkan
    kontaminan.
- question: Are there any hazardous fumes generated when laser cleaning gold, especially from alloys or surface contaminants?
  answer: Laser cleaning gold at 532 nm wavelength and 0.8 J/cm² fluence can aerosolize hazardous alloying elements like nickel
    or cadmium. Proper fume extraction with HEPA/ULPA filtration is mandatory. Always consult the specific alloy's MSDS to
    identify and mitigate risks from vaporized contaminants.
- question: Why might a laser cleaning process that works on other precious metals (like silver) not be directly applicable
    to gold?
  answer: Gold's exceptional thermal conductivity and chemical inertness require distinct laser parameters compared to reactive
    metals like silver. We must carefully control the fluence near 0.8 J/cm² and use a 532 nm wavelength to ensure efficient
    energy coupling for contaminant removal without causing microstructural damage to the substrate.
