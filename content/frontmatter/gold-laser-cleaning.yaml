        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: Gold is an FCC metal with no allotropic transformations, making
          it exceptionally ductile and malleable. It has no true yield point and work
          hardens slowly. The compressive strength is not a fixed value but depends
          on the material's condition (e.g., annealed vs. cold-worked). The cited
          value of ~120 MPa is a representative ultimate compressive strength for
          annealed, high-purity gold, as reported in authoritative materials handbooks.
          The low confidence reflects the fact that compressive strength is rarely
          a critical design parameter for gold due to its primary use in applications
          where extreme ductility is paramount.

        research_basis: Gold is an extremely ductile face-centered cubic (FCC) metal
          with no discernible brittle-to-ductile transition. It does not fail in a
          brittle manner under standard conditions, making the concept of fracture
          toughness (K_IC) less meaningful. The reported value is an extremely low,
          effectively negligible, estimate based on its high ductility and the understanding
          that it yields and deforms plastically long before any linear-elastic fracture
          mechanics (LEFM) conditions can be met. The ASM Handbook and other materials
          science references confirm that pure gold's fracture toughness is not a
          standard property due to its exceptional malleability.
