        research_basis: Gold is a noble metal with exceptional oxidation resistance.
          It does not form surface oxides at any temperature in air. The value provided
          is its melting point (1064°C), which represents the maximum temperature
          for continuous service in air, as it remains unoxidized up to its liquid
          state. No significant oxidation occurs below this temperature.

        research_basis: Pure gold is an extremely ductile metal with no yield point
          and very low strength in its annealed state. The provided value is a typical
          flexural strength for high-purity (99.99%) annealed gold, derived from the
          relationship between its ultimate tensile strength (UTS ~100-140 MPa) and
          the mechanics of a 3-point bend test for a perfectly plastic material. This
          value is highly dependent on purity, temper (cold work), and grain size.

        research_basis: Gold is an FCC metal with no allotropic transformations, making
          it exceptionally ductile and malleable. It has no true yield point and work
          hardens slowly. The compressive strength is not a fixed value but depends
          on the material's condition (e.g., annealed vs. cold-worked). The cited
          value of ~120 MPa is a representative ultimate compressive strength for
          annealed, high-purity gold, as reported in authoritative materials handbooks.
          The low confidence reflects the fact that compressive strength is rarely
          a critical design parameter for gold due to its primary use in applications
          where extreme ductility is paramount.

        research_basis: Gold is an extremely ductile face-centered cubic (FCC) metal
          with no discernible brittle-to-ductile transition. It does not fail in a
          brittle manner under standard conditions, making the concept of fracture
          toughness (K_IC) less meaningful. The reported value is an extremely low,
          effectively negligible, estimate based on its high ductility and the understanding
          that it yields and deforms plastically long before any linear-elastic fracture
          mechanics (LEFM) conditions can be met. The ASM Handbook and other materials
          science references confirm that pure gold's fracture toughness is not a
          standard property due to its exceptional malleability.
