    compressiveStrength:
      value: 55.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of Polyvinyl Chloride is highly dependent
        on its formulation (rigid vs. flexible). For rigid PVC, which aligns with
        the provided high hardness (83 Shore D), authoritative engineering handbooks
        and material databases (ASM, MatWeb) consistently report compressive yield
        strength values in the range of 50-80 MPa. The value of 55 MPa is a conservative
        and commonly cited figure for general-purpose rigid PVC under standard test
        conditions (room temperature, 23°C).

    corrosionResistance:

      unit: rating
      research_basis: PVC is widely documented as having excellent resistance to a
        broad range of chemicals, including acids, alkalis, and salts, making it a
        standard material for corrosion-resistant piping and fittings. Its primary
        weakness is limited resistance to certain solvents and aromatic hydrocarbons,
        preventing a perfect score.

      value: 80.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: MatWeb, a widely recognized database of material properties
        used in engineering, reports a typical flexural strength range of 80-110 MPa
        for rigid, unfilled PVC. The lower end of this range (80 MPa) is a conservative
        and commonly cited value for general-purpose material. This property is typically
        determined by standardized 3-point bend test methods such as ASTM D790.

    oxidationResistance:

      research_basis: UL standards list PVC's maximum continuous service temperature
        in air as 60-75°C, with 60°C being the conservative rating for general purpose
        PVC formulations. PVC begins significant thermal degradation and oxidation
        around this temperature range, releasing hydrogen chloride.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 3.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: PVC's fracture toughness (K_IC) varies significantly with formulation
        (rigid vs. plasticized), molecular weight, and processing. Rigid PVC (uPVC)
        typically ranges from 2.0-4.0 MPa·√m at room temperature, with most engineering
        references clustering around 2.5-3.5 MPa·√m. The provided high hardness (83
        Shore D) confirms this is rigid PVC, placing it in the upper portion of this
        range.
