caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the polyvinyl chloride surface, contaminated, presents
    a rugged topography marred by clustered impurities. Contaminants feature fine
    dust particles, 1-10 microns in diameter, alongside oily organic residues that
    form adherent films. Surface degradation reveals micro-pitting and subtle cracking,
    eroding the polymer's smoothness and integrity. This state, it underscores the
    urgency of thorough cleaning to sustain PVC's reliability in everyday applications.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of Polyvinyl Chloride presents a smooth, contaminant-free
    finish, restored to its original luster without abrasions. This restoration achieves
    superior quality, preserving the material's integrity—its flexibility, durability,
    and chemical resistance remain fully intact. For general cleaning applications,
    such condition ensures reliable performance and longevity.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of Polyvinyl Chloride is highly dependent
          on its formulation (rigid vs. flexible). For rigid PVC, which aligns with
          the provided high hardness (83 Shore D), authoritative engineering handbooks
          and material databases (ASM, MatWeb) consistently report compressive yield
          strength values in the range of 50-80 MPa. The value of 55 MPa is a conservative
          and commonly cited figure for general-purpose rigid PVC under standard test
          conditions (room temperature, 23°C).

          it a standard material for corrosion-resistant piping and fittings. Its
          primary weakness is limited resistance to certain solvents and aromatic
          hydrocarbons, preventing a perfect score.

        research_basis: PVC's fracture toughness (K_IC) varies significantly with
          formulation (rigid vs. plasticized), molecular weight, and processing. Rigid
          PVC (uPVC) typically ranges from 2.0-4.0 MPa·√m at room temperature, with
          most engineering references clustering around 2.5-3.5 MPa·√m. The provided
          high hardness (83 Shore D) confirms this is rigid PVC, placing it in the
          upper portion of this range.
