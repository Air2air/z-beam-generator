  description: Microscopic analysis of Polyvinyl Chloride surface before and after
    laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the polyvinyl chloride surface, contaminated, presents
    a rugged topography marred by clustered impurities. Contaminants feature fine
    dust particles, 1-10 microns in diameter, alongside oily organic residues that
    form adherent films. Surface degradation reveals micro-pitting and subtle cracking,
    eroding the polymer's smoothness and integrity. This state, it underscores the
    urgency of thorough cleaning to sustain PVC's reliability in everyday applications.
  afterText: "The cleaned surface of Polyvinyl Chloride presents a smooth, contaminant-free\
    \ finish, restored to its original luster without abrasions. This restoration\
    \ achieves superior quality, preserving the material's integrity\u2014its flexibility,\
    \ durability, and chemical resistance remain fully intact. For general cleaning\
    \ applications, such condition ensures reliable performance and longevity."
