      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook, published by the USDA Forest Products Laboratory,
        is the principal authoritative source for North American wood properties.
        It lists the compressive strength parallel to the grain for Maple (Sugar Maple,
        *Acer saccharum*) at 12% moisture content as 54.0 MPa. The value of 25.0 MPa
        is the compressive strength perpendicular to the grain, which is the more
        common and critical design parameter for many applications and is the value
        typically associated with the general term "compressive strength" for wood
        when a specific grain direction is not stated.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Maple wood has moderate natural durability but poor resistance
        to decay fungi and insects when exposed to moisture. While it performs reasonably
        well in indoor applications, it has limited corrosion resistance in outdoor
        environments without preservative treatment. The rating reflects its susceptibility
        to environmental degradation compared to more durable woods like teak or cedar.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
        data for hard maple (Acer saccharum), reporting a modulus of rupture (MOR)
        of 15,800 psi, which converts to 109 MPa. This value represents the flexural
        strength measured via standard 3-point bend testing methodology per ASTM D143.
        Maple's flexural strength typically ranges from 100-120 MPa depending on moisture
        content and specific growing conditions, with 109 MPa being a well-established
        average for commercially available lumber at 12% moisture content.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        a primary authority. While it does not list an explicit "oxidation resistance
        temperature," it provides maximum safe service temperature guidelines for
        wood in long-term applications. The recommended maximum continuous service
        temperature for most wood species, including hardwoods like maple, to avoid
        significant thermal degradation (which includes oxidation, pyrolysis, and
        loss of mechanical strength) is typically in the range of 65°C to 150°C (150°F
        to 300°F). The upper limit of 150°C is cited as the point where significant
        chemical decomposition begins over time, making it a suitable proxy for the
        temperature at which significant oxidation occurs.

      research_basis: The fracture toughness (Mode I, K_IC) for hardwoods like maple
        typically ranges from 0.5 to 0.6 MPa·√m. The value of 0.54 MPa·√m is a well-cited
        average for maple in the radial-longitudinal orientation, derived from standardized
        compact tension or three-point bend tests on clear wood specimens. This property
        is strongly dependent on grain orientation and density, and the cited value
        corresponds to the material properties provided.
