  description: Microscopic analysis of Maple surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the maple wood surface reveals a porous texture
    marred by contaminants. Fine particulate matter, including dust and organic residues,
    adheres unevenly to the fibers, causing localized discoloration and subtle erosion.
    This degradation, it weakens the material's natural integrity, underscoring cleaning
    needs for preservation.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the maple surface gleams with renewed smoothness,
    its natural grain restored without abrasion. This restoration quality excels,
    eliminating contaminants while preserving the wood's inherent hardness and density.
    Material integrity stays fully intact, ensuring durability for subsequent uses
    in woodworking or finishing.
