caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the maple wood surface reveals a porous texture
    marred by contaminants. Fine particulate matter, including dust and organic residues,
    adheres unevenly to the fibers, causing localized discoloration and subtle erosion.
    This degradation, it weakens the material's natural integrity, underscoring cleaning
    needs for preservation.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the maple surface gleams with renewed smoothness,
    its natural grain restored without abrasion. This restoration quality excels,
    eliminating contaminants while preserving the wood's inherent hardness and density.
    Material integrity stays fully intact, ensuring durability for subsequent uses
    in woodworking or finishing.

        research_basis: Maple wood has moderate natural durability but poor resistance
          to decay fungi and insects when exposed to moisture. While it performs reasonably
          well in indoor applications, it has limited corrosion resistance in outdoor
          environments without preservative treatment. The rating reflects its susceptibility
          to environmental degradation compared to more durable woods like teak or
          cedar.

          is a primary authority. While it does not list an explicit "oxidation resistance
          temperature," it provides maximum safe service temperature guidelines for
          wood in long-term applications. The recommended maximum continuous service
          temperature for most wood species, including hardwoods like maple, to avoid
          significant thermal degradation (which includes oxidation, pyrolysis, and
          loss of mechanical strength) is typically in the range of 65°C to 150°C
          (150°F to 300°F). The upper limit of 150°C is cited as the point where significant
          chemical decomposition begins over time, making it a suitable proxy for
          the temperature at which significant oxidation occurs.
