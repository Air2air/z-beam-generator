  beforeText: Under microscopy, the contaminated polyester resin composite surface appears very-very rough and is covered
    by fine dust particles plus oily residues that stick tightly. Contaminants show as irregular clumps, causing degradation
    like micro-cracks and pitting, so the surface looks dull and uneven, then needs cleaning for better condition.
  afterText: After cleaning, the polyester resin composite surface appears very-very smooth and clean. The process removes
    dirt then restores original gloss without harm. Material integrity stays intact, so no cracks or weakening occur. Restoration
    quality is good, making surface look new and ready for use.

faq:
- question: What are the optimal laser parameters (wavelength, power, pulse duration) for safely removing contaminants from
    polyester resin composites without damaging the underlying material?
  answer: Untuk komposit resin poliester, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluensi 3.0 J/cm² dan daya 90 W untuk menghilangkan
    kontaminan secara efektif. Parameter nanodetik ini meminimalkan zona termal yang terpengaruh, mengurangi risiko pembakaran
    atau penguningan matriks resin yang sensitif panas. Selalu uji coba di area kecil terlebih dahulu untuk memverifikasi
    hasilnya.
- question: How do I clean soot, pollution, or biological growth (like mold) from a fiberglass/polyester composite boat hull
    without etching the gel coat?
  answer: Untuk kontaminan permukaan seperti jelaga pada gel coat, gunakan laser 1064 nm dengan fluence 3.0 J/cm² dan daya
    90 W. Pengaturan ini menguapkan polutan tanpa merusak resin poliester. Namun, pewarna yang meresap ke dalam matriks komposit
    tidak dapat dibersihkan dan memerlukan metode lain.
- question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove paint or coatings from polyester composites without causing delamination
    or fiber exposure?
  answer: Laser paint removal on polyester composites carries significant delamination risk. The 1064 nm wavelength and 3.0
    J/cm² fluence can be absorbed by the resin, generating internal gas pressure that blisters the matrix. This method is
    often not recommended due to the high probability of subsurface damage.
- question: What specific fumes and particulates are generated when laser cleaning polyester resin composites, and what filtration
    is required?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 3.0 J/cm² decomposes the polyester matrix, releasing hazardous styrene vapor and fine glass fibers.
    An extraction system with HEPA and activated carbon filtration is mandatory, alongside respiratory PPE, to capture these
    ultrafine particulates and volatile organic compounds.
- question: Is laser cleaning a viable method for preparing a polyester composite surface for repair or re-adhesion?
  answer: Laser cleaning is highly viable for polyester composites, achieving optimal surface roughness at 3.0 J/cm². This
    method avoids fiber damage from abrasion. However, a subsequent cleaning step is essential to remove any low-molecular-weight
    oxidized residues that could compromise the final bond strength.
- question: Why did my laser cleaning attempt on a black polyester composite part leave a white, chalky residue or discoloration?
  answer: The white residue indicates thermal degradation of the black polyester resin matrix. Your fluence of 3.0 J/cm² likely
    ablated the surface polymer, exposing the underlying glass fibers or mineral fillers like talc, which appear chalky.
- question: How does the presence of glass fibers versus carbon fibers in the composite change the laser cleaning approach?
  answer: Glass fibers' transparency allows 1064 nm laser energy to penetrate and clean the resin matrix effectively. In contrast,
    carbon fibers' high absorption at this wavelength causes rapid heating, demanding extreme precision with fluence below
    3.0 J/cm² to prevent thermal degradation.
- question: What is the fundamental ablation mechanism when a laser interacts with a polyester resin composite?
  answer: The fundamental mechanism is primarily thermal ablation. At our optimal 3.0 J/cm² fluence and 1064 nm wavelength,
    the laser energy is absorbed by the polymer matrix, causing rapid heating that decomposes and vaporizes contaminants before
    the underlying composite's damage threshold is reached. This ensures selective removal with minimal thermal impact on
    the material.
- question: Are there any regulatory or compliance issues (e.g., EPA, OSHA) specific to the laser ablation of composite materials
    like polyester resin?
  answer: OSHA mandates strict monitoring of airborne styrene and ultrafine particulates generated during laser ablation at
    3.0 J/cm². The ablated waste, a contaminated solid, falls under EPA regulations for hazardous material disposal. Proper
    fume extraction and waste capture systems are essential for compliance with these worker safety and environmental protocols.
