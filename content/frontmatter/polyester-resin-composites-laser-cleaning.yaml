subcategory: fiber-reinforced
caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the contaminated polyester resin composite surface
    appears very-very rough and is covered by fine dust particles plus oily residues
    that stick tightly. Contaminants show as irregular clumps, causing degradation
    like micro-cracks and pitting, so the surface looks dull and uneven, then needs
    cleaning for better condition.
  afterText: After cleaning, the polyester resin composite surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean. The process removes dirt then restores original gloss without
    harm. Material integrity stays intact, so no cracks or weakening occur. Restoration
    quality is good, making surface look new and ready for use.

          with typical polyester resin composites. Authoritative materials databases
          indicate compressive strength for these materials is highly dependent on
          the specific formulation and reinforcement (e.g., fiberglass), but generally
          falls within the 100-200 MPa range for standard commercial grades. The hardness
          value (42.0 Shore D) is a secondary indicator supporting this strength range.

        research_basis: Polyester resin composites demonstrate good resistance to
          mild chemical environments, water, and atmospheric exposure due to their
          cross-linked molecular structure. They resist many dilute acids, alkalis,
          and salts, though performance decreases with concentrated chemicals and
          strong solvents. Their corrosion resistance is superior to many metals but
          less than premium thermoset resins like vinyl ester or epoxy in aggressive
          conditions.

          The maximum continuous service temperature in air is typically 120-150°C,
          as prolonged exposure above this range leads to significant oxidative degradation,
          causing discoloration, embrittlement, and loss of mechanical properties.
          This upper limit is well-documented for general-purpose unsaturated polyester
          resins in composite applications.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness of polyester resin composites is highly
          dependent on the specific filler/reinforcement. For unfilled or particulate-filled
          polyester resins, K_IC values are typically low, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0
          MPa·√m. The provided value of 0.6 MPa·√m represents a typical mid-range
          value for a general-purpose, mineral-filled polyester composite system,
          as documented in composite materials handbooks. The low toughness is characteristic
          of the brittle polyester matrix.
