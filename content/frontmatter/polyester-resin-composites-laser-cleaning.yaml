    compressiveStrength:
      value: 150.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        typical polyester resin composites. Authoritative materials databases indicate
        compressive strength for these materials is highly dependent on the specific
        formulation and reinforcement (e.g., fiberglass), but generally falls within
        the 100-200 MPa range for standard commercial grades. The hardness value (42.0
        Shore D) is a secondary indicator supporting this strength range.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 7.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Polyester resin composites demonstrate good resistance to mild
        chemical environments, water, and atmospheric exposure due to their cross-linked
        molecular structure. They resist many dilute acids, alkalis, and salts, though
        performance decreases with concentrated chemicals and strong solvents. Their
        corrosion resistance is superior to many metals but less than premium thermoset
        resins like vinyl ester or epoxy in aggressive conditions.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Polyester resins are thermosets with moderate thermal stability.
        The maximum continuous service temperature in air is typically 120-150°C,
        as prolonged exposure above this range leads to significant oxidative degradation,
        causing discoloration, embrittlement, and loss of mechanical properties. This
        upper limit is well-documented for general-purpose unsaturated polyester resins
        in composite applications.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.6
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness of polyester resin composites is highly
        dependent on the specific filler/reinforcement. For unfilled or particulate-filled
        polyester resins, K_IC values are typically low, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 MPa·√m.
        The provided value of 0.6 MPa·√m represents a typical mid-range value for
        a general-purpose, mineral-filled polyester composite system, as documented
        in composite materials handbooks. The low toughness is characteristic of the
        brittle polyester matrix.
