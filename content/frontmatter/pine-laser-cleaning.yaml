  beforeText: Under microscopy, the pine surface reveals embedded dirt particles and
    slight pitting. This contamination erodes its smooth, natural grain.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the pine surface gleams with restored natural luster,
    its grain vividly revealed without blemish. This treatment upholds material integrity,
    preventing fiber degradation and ensuring superior restoration quality for enduring
    wood applications.

        research_basis: The provided hardness value of 40.0 MPa is identical to the
          typical compressive strength value for pine parallel to grain. For many
          softwoods like pine, there is a strong correlation between Janka hardness
          (measured in MPa) and compressive strength. The Wood Database lists the
          compressive strength of Eastern White Pine as 40 MPa, which aligns precisely
          with the given data point.

          fungi, insects, and moisture. The USDA Wood Handbook rates untreated pine
          species as "slightly resistant" to "non-resistant" to decay, placing it
          in the lowest durability categories. While not metallic corrosion, wood
          decay is the equivalent corrosion mechanism for this material.

        research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory, the primary wood research
          institution of the USDA, states that prolonged exposure to temperatures
          above 150°C (302°F) causes significant thermal degradation in wood, including
          hemicellulose decomposition and accelerated oxidative reactions, leading
          to permanent loss of mechanical properties. While wood can char at higher
          temperatures in short-term fire events, 150°C is the established maximum
          for continuous service in air before significant chemical degradation begins.
