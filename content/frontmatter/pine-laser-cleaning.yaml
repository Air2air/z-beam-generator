    compressiveStrength:
      value: 40.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided hardness value of 40.0 MPa is identical to the
        typical compressive strength value for pine parallel to grain. For many softwoods
        like pine, there is a strong correlation between Janka hardness (measured
        in MPa) and compressive strength. The Wood Database lists the compressive
        strength of Eastern White Pine as 40 MPa, which aligns precisely with the
        given data point.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Pine is a softwood with poor natural durability against decay
        fungi, insects, and moisture. The USDA Wood Handbook rates untreated pine
        species as "slightly resistant" to "non-resistant" to decay, placing it in
        the lowest durability categories. While not metallic corrosion, wood decay
        is the equivalent corrosion mechanism for this material.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 59.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        the preeminent authority on wood properties. It reports the modulus of rupture
        (MOR), which is the standard measure of flexural/bending strength, for pine
        species at 12% moisture content. The value of 59.0 MPa is a representative
        average for common structural pine species.
    hardness:
      value: 40.0
      min: 1
      max: 5000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Products Laboratory Wood Handbook (Chapter 4: Mechanical
        Properties of Wood), ASTM D143-14 Standard Test Methods for Small Clear Specimens
        of Timber, with specific data for Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus) under
        standardized moisture content conditions'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory, the primary wood research institution
        of the USDA, states that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 150°C (302°F)
        causes significant thermal degradation in wood, including hemicellulose decomposition
        and accelerated oxidative reactions, leading to permanent loss of mechanical
        properties. While wood can char at higher temperatures in short-term fire
        events, 150°C is the established maximum for continuous service in air before
        significant chemical degradation begins.
