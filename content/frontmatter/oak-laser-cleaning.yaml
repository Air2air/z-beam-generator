    compressiveStrength:

      research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
        data for various oak species. The reported compressive strength (crushing
        strength) parallel to grain for white oak is approximately 46 MPa, while red
        oak is around 43 MPa. This value represents the stress at the proportional
        limit during standard testing per ASTM D143. Test conditions assume 12% moisture
        content and loading parallel to grain, which is the standard reporting method
        for wood compressive strength.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 7.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Oak is a durable hardwood with good resistance to decay and
        environmental corrosion when not in ground contact. Its natural tannins and
        dense cell structure provide protection against fungal decay and weathering,
        though it is not as resistant as some tropical hardwoods or treated woods.
        The rating reflects its performance in above-ground, non-marine environments.

      research_basis: The USDA Forest Products Laboratory is the preeminent authority
        on North American wood properties. The Wood Handbook provides a flexural strength
        (modulus of rupture) value of 97 MPa for White Oak, a primary species of Oak
        used in engineering applications, based on standardized 3-point and 4-point
        bend tests on small, clear specimens. This value is widely cited and accepted
        in engineering and design standards.

      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        a primary authoritative source for wood properties. It states that prolonged
        exposure to temperatures above 150 °C (300 °F) leads to significant chemical
        degradation, including pyrolysis and oxidation, which reduces strength and
        mass. This temperature is widely cited as the maximum for continuous service
        before significant thermal decomposition begins.

        oak in the radial-longitudinal orientation, which is the most commonly reported
        orientation for wood fracture toughness testing. The value falls within the
        typical range of 0.3-0.6 MPa·√m for hardwoods and is consistent with oak's
        density and mechanical properties.
