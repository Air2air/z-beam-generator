  beforeText: Under the microscope, the oak surface displays a contaminated condition
    with irregular topography. Adherent particles—fine dust grains and oily residues—cluster
    within the porous wood fibers, measuring 1-10 microns in size and exhibiting amorphous
    shapes. This buildup fosters surface degradation, manifesting as micro-fissures,
    fiber erosion, and localized discoloration, which undermine the material's structural
    integrity for cleaning and manufacturing applications.
  afterText: The cleaned oak surface gleams smoothly, its natural grain restored vividly.
    Quality restoration preserves full material integrity without compromise.

          data for various oak species. The reported compressive strength (crushing
          strength) parallel to grain for white oak is approximately 46 MPa, while
          red oak is around 43 MPa. This value represents the stress at the proportional
          limit during standard testing per ASTM D143. Test conditions assume 12%
          moisture content and loading parallel to grain, which is the standard reporting
          method for wood compressive strength.

          though it is not as resistant as some tropical hardwoods or treated woods.
          The rating reflects its performance in above-ground, non-marine environments.
