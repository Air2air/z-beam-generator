  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, the alabaster surface reveals a network
    of fine cracks and pitting from prolonged exposure. Contaminants appear as clustered
    particulate matter—dust, organic residues, and mineral deposits—adhering unevenly,
    causing localized discoloration and erosion. This degradation, it compromises
    the stone's natural translucency and structural integrity.
  afterText: The cleaned alabaster surface gleams with pristine smoothness. Restoration
    achieves high quality, fully preserving the stone's delicate integrity.

  after_text: What strikes me about this material now is the captivating transformation
    after laser cleaning; the alabaster reveals a beautiful clarity, almost as if
    it breathes again, with surface contaminants reduced to near imperceptible traces—likely
    less than 0. 01 mm if I were to guess without precise tools at hand. I find remarkable
    how the laser’s technical artistry, tuned to a gentle 45 W power and 50 kHz repetition
    rate, has restored visual harmony, echoing the meticulous care of Italian artisans
    who’ve shaped such stone for centuries in architectural and artistic masterpieces.
    This elegant transformation not only revives the stone’s intrinsic charm but also
    offers practical benefits for Italy’s heritage conservation, ensuring sculptures
    and ornaments in our historic cities withstand time without chemical harm or water
    waste, well, one hopes at least.

  before_text: Examining this beautiful surface of alabaster, I must confess a deep
    appreciation for its delicate translucency, yet I’m struck by the uneven layer
    of contamination—perhaps a mix of organic residues and atmospheric deposits, roughly
    0. 2 to 0. 5 mm thick in patches, obscuring its natural elegance. One cannot help
    but notice how these impurities cling stubbornly to the soft, porous structure,
    a challenge we often face in Italy when restoring cultural heritage pieces where
    alabaster’s aesthetic excellence must be preserved with utmost care.

        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: Alabaster (a form of gypsum) is known for its low compressive
          strength compared to other stones. Authoritative geotechnical and materials
          engineering handbooks consistently report its unconfined compressive strength
          in the range of 10-15 MPa for air-dry specimens tested at room temperature.
          The value of 12 MPa is a representative median from these sources, reflecting
          the material's soft and friable nature.

          due to high solubility in water, susceptibility to acid rain dissolution,
          and physical degradation from salt crystallization. While chemically more
          stable than some carbonates, it rapidly deteriorates in polluted urban environments
          and areas with freeze-thaw cycles, earning a low durability rating among
          natural building stones.
