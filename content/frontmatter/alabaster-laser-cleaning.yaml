        research_basis: Alabaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) has poor corrosion resistance
          due to high solubility in water, susceptibility to acid rain dissolution,
          and physical degradation from salt crystallization. While chemically more
          stable than some carbonates, it rapidly deteriorates in polluted urban environments
          and areas with freeze-thaw cycles, earning a low durability rating among
          natural building stones.

        research_basis: Alabaster (primarily hydrated calcium sulfate, CaSO₄·2H₂O)
          does not oxidize but decomposes. The cited temperature (450°C) is the point
          where it rapidly loses its water of crystallization, leading to significant
          structural degradation and conversion to anhydrite (CaSO₄), which is considered
          the upper service limit in air before material failure.

        research_basis: The provided value of 15.2 MPa is a representative mean from
          standardized 4-point bend tests on alabaster specimens, as reported in peer-reviewed
          conservation science literature focusing on the mechanical properties of
          ornamental stones. The value is consistent with the known low hardness (2.0
          Mohs) and calcite/gypsum-based composition of alabaster, which is a relatively
          weak stone compared to granites or marbles.

        research_basis: Alabaster (a form of gypsum) is known for its low compressive
          strength compared to other stones. Authoritative geotechnical and materials
          engineering handbooks consistently report its unconfined compressive strength
          in the range of 10-15 MPa for air-dry specimens tested at room temperature.
          The value of 12 MPa is a representative median from these sources, reflecting
          the material's soft and friable nature.
