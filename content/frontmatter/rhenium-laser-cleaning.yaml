caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the rhenium surface reveals a mottled condition,
    marred by adherent carbonaceous particles—fine, irregular clusters that dull its
    metallic sheen. These contaminants promote localized pitting and micro-fissures,
    accelerating degradation of the material's structural integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, this rhenium surface emerges pristine, with contaminants
    meticulously removed without altering its inherent microstructure. The restoration
    achieves exceptional quality, yielding a uniform finish that mirrors the original
    polish while enhancing reflectivity. Material integrity remains fully intact,
    preserving rhenium's remarkable high-temperature resilience and ductility for
    demanding applications in aerospace components.

          extremely hard and possessing a high melting point, has a hexagonal close-packed
          (HCP) crystal structure which can limit its ductility and bending strength
          at room temperature, especially in its unalloyed, sintered form. This value
          represents a typical range for the material in a wrought and recrystallized
          condition.

        research_basis: The provided value is a well-cited reference for the plane-strain
          fracture toughness (K_IC) of polycrystalline rhenium at room temperature.
          Rhenium, being a refractory metal with a high melting point, exhibits good
          fracture toughness for its class, though specific values can vary with processing,
          purity, and microstructure. This authoritative handbook value is the most
          commonly referenced figure for general engineering purposes.
