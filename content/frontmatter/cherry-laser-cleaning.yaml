        research_basis: Cherry wood has poor natural corrosion resistance, rated as
          non-durable to perishable regarding decay resistance. It has low resistance
          to insect attack and fungal decay, with limited weathering capabilities.
          The Wood Database specifically notes its susceptibility to rot when exposed
          to moisture and outdoor conditions, classifying it below most commonly used
          outdoor woods.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
          is the authoritative source on wood properties. It states that significant
          thermal degradation (including oxidative processes) for most wood species
          begins in the range of 150-200°C under prolonged exposure. Cherry wood,
          being a hardwood with moderate density, is consistently referenced in industry
          guidelines (e.g., for kiln drying and heat treatment) with a maximum safe
          continuous service temperature of 150°C to avoid charring, weight loss,
          and significant loss of mechanical strength.
