      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority for wood properties,
        lists the compressive strength of Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) parallel
        to the grain at 12% moisture content as 6,670 psi, which converts to 46.0
        MPa. This value is consistent with the provided hardness and density data,
        indicating a medium-strength hardwood.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Cherry wood has poor natural corrosion resistance, rated as
        non-durable to perishable regarding decay resistance. It has low resistance
        to insect attack and fungal decay, with limited weathering capabilities. The
        Wood Database specifically notes its susceptibility to rot when exposed to
        moisture and outdoor conditions, classifying it below most commonly used outdoor
        woods.

      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,

        to approximately 85 MPa. This value is derived from standardized 3-point and
        4-point bend tests and is consistent with the known density and hardness properties
        provided.

      value: 150.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory is
        the authoritative source on wood properties. It states that significant thermal
        degradation (including oxidative processes) for most wood species begins in
        the range of 150-200°C under prolonged exposure. Cherry wood, being a hardwood
        with moderate density, is consistently referenced in industry guidelines (e.g.,
        for kiln drying and heat treatment) with a maximum safe continuous service
        temperature of 150°C to avoid charring, weight loss, and significant loss
        of mechanical strength.

      research_basis: The fracture toughness (Mode I, K_IC) of wood is highly dependent
        on grain orientation. For common hardwoods, including species like cherry,
        values typically range from 0.3 to 0.6 MPa·√m for crack propagation perpendicular
        to the grain. The provided value is a conservative estimate for cherry based
        on its density and hardness relative to other hardwoods documented in this
        authoritative source.
