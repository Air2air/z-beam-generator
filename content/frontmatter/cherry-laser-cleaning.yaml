caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the cherry wood surface shows a rough, fibrous texture
    marred by clustered dust particles and sticky organic residues. Contaminants feature
    fine silica grains and lipid films that infiltrate pores, causing degradation
    like micro-fissures and subtle discoloration. This impacts laser enclosure aesthetics,
    demanding targeted cleaning in optical assemblies.
  afterText: After cleaning, the cherry wood surface regains its smooth, even texture
    and vibrant reddish-brown patina, restoring near-original vibrancy without residue
    buildup. Restoration quality excels, upholding material integrity by avoiding
    grain distortion or fiber weakening, ensuring long-term durability. This supports
    applications in precision laser-cut furniture for optical system enclosures.

          being a hardwood with moderate density, is consistently referenced in industry
          guidelines (e.g., for kiln drying and heat treatment) with a maximum safe
          continuous service temperature of 150°C to avoid charring, weight loss,
          and significant loss of mechanical strength.
