        research_basis: Platinum is a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal with high ductility,
          and pure metals in this group typically do not have a definitive compressive
          strength as they yield and deform plastically rather than fracture. The
          provided range represents the compressive yield strength (typically at 0.2%
          offset) for annealed, high-purity platinum, which is highly dependent on
          purity, grain size, and prior work hardening. The value is derived from
          the material's known tensile behavior and hardness correlation, as compressive
          strength for such ductile metals is generally similar to tensile strength.

          does not form a stable oxide (platinum oxide decomposes around 500-600 °C).
          The limit of ~1000 °C in air is not due to catastrophic oxidation but to
          a slow, continuous loss of material through the formation of volatile PtO₂,
          which becomes significant at this temperature. Below this, it is considered
          highly stable.

        research_basis: Platinum, as a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal, exhibits high
          ductility and good fracture toughness. The reported K_IC value for high-purity
          platinum falls within the range of approximately 35-40 MPa·√m at room temperature.
          The value of 38.0 MPa·√m is a representative mid-range value cited in authoritative
          materials handbooks for general design purposes.
