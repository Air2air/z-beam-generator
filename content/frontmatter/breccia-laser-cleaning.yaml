    compressiveStrength:
      value: 120.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock with highly variable properties
        depending on its composition and cementing material. The cited ASTM compilation
        provides a typical compressive strength range of 80-160 MPa for commercial
        breccia varieties. The value of 120 MPa represents a conservative, widely
        cited average for competent, well-cemented breccia used in construction.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Breccia, as a natural stone composed of angular mineral/rock
        fragments cemented in a fine-grained matrix, shares the high corrosion/weathering
        resistance of quartz-based dimension stones like granite and sandstone. Its
        low porosity and high density (2.6 g/cm³) provide inherent resistance to environmental
        chemical attack, freeze-thaw cycles, and pollutant erosion. While not as chemically
        inert as pure quartzite, its performance in architectural applications under
        general atmospheric conditions is rated as very high.
    density:
      value: 2.6
      min: 1.5
      max: 6.0
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: ASTM C97/C97M-18 Standard Test Methods for Absorption and Bulk
        Specific Gravity of Dimension Stone, supplemented by geological surveys of
        breccia compositions from USGS Bulletin 1450 and specific density measurements
        of polymict breccias in construction materials databases
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 15.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is a conservative estimate derived from the
        cited peer-reviewed source, which tested various dimension stones. Breccia,
        being a polymict conglomerate with a variable composition and clast-matrix
        bond, has a wide potential strength range (approximately 10-25 MPa). The value
        of 15 MPa represents a typical mid-to-lower range figure suitable for general
        engineering assessments, as the specific strength is highly dependent on the
        quarry source and the orientation of foliation or bedding.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Breccia, as a carbonate-rich sedimentary rock, is primarily
        composed of calcite and other carbonate minerals. Authoritative engineering
        geology texts indicate that the calcite (CaCO₃) in such stones begins to dissociate
        (calcine) in air at temperatures around 600-750°C, with 600°C being the conservative
        threshold for the onset of significant chemical decomposition and loss of
        structural integrity. This is not oxidation in the metallic sense, but a thermally-driven
        chemical breakdown which is the relevant failure mode for this material in
        high-temperature, oxidative environments.

      research_basis: Breccia is a elastic sedimentary rock composed of angular fragments.
        Its fracture toughness is estimated based on its composition and comparison
        with similar rocks like sandstone and limestone, which typically range from
        0.5 to 1.5 MPa·√m. The given value represents a conservative estimate for
        a medium-strength breccia.
