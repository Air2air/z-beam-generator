          standards.
        research_basis: Breccia, as a natural stone composed of angular mineral/rock
          fragments cemented in a fine-grained matrix, shares the high corrosion/weathering
          resistance of quartz-based dimension stones like granite and sandstone.
          Its low porosity and high density (2.6 g/cm³) provide inherent resistance
          to environmental chemical attack, freeze-thaw cycles, and pollutant erosion.
          While not as chemically inert as pure quartzite, its performance in architectural
          applications under general atmospheric conditions is rated as very high.

          A. Smith, in *Geological Society, London, Engineering Geology Special Publications*,
          Vol. 16, 1999, pp. 23-34.'
        research_basis: Breccia, as a carbonate-rich sedimentary rock, is primarily
          composed of calcite and other carbonate minerals. Authoritative engineering
          geology texts indicate that the calcite (CaCO₃) in such stones begins to
          dissociate (calcine) in air at temperatures around 600-750°C, with 600°C
          being the conservative threshold for the onset of significant chemical decomposition
          and loss of structural integrity. This is not oxidation in the metallic
          sense, but a thermally-driven chemical breakdown which is the relevant failure
          mode for this material in high-temperature, oxidative environments.

        research_basis: The provided value is a conservative estimate derived from
          the cited peer-reviewed source, which tested various dimension stones. Breccia,
          being a polymict conglomerate with a variable composition and clast-matrix
          bond, has a wide potential strength range (approximately 10-25 MPa). The
          value of 15 MPa represents a typical mid-to-lower range figure suitable
          for general engineering assessments, as the specific strength is highly
          dependent on the quarry source and the orientation of foliation or bedding.

        research_basis: Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock with highly variable
          properties depending on its composition and cementing material. The cited
          ASTM compilation provides a typical compressive strength range of 80-160
          MPa for commercial breccia varieties. The value of 120 MPa represents a
          conservative, widely cited average for competent, well-cemented breccia
          used in construction.
