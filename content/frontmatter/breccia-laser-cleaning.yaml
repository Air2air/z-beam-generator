caption:
  beforeText: Under microscope, Breccia stone surface appears dirty-dirty and uneven,
    with fine dust particles and oily residues clinging tightly to its porous texture.
    Contaminants form clusters that block natural cracks, causing discoloration and
    dull shine. Surface degradation shows as micro-pits and slight etching, where
    material wears slowly then weakens overall structure.
  afterText: The cleaned breccia surface appears very-very smooth and restored, with
    dirt removed then natural colors revealed clearly. The process cleans effectively,
    so original textures shine without damage. Material integrity stays intact, no
    cracks form, and stone strength remains strong. Restoration quality is high, making
    the surface look fresh and beautiful for general uses.

        research_basis: Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock with highly variable
          properties depending on its composition and cementing material. The cited
          ASTM compilation provides a typical compressive strength range of 80-160
          MPa for commercial breccia varieties. The value of 120 MPa represents a
          conservative, widely cited average for competent, well-cemented breccia
          used in construction.

          fragments cemented in a fine-grained matrix, shares the high corrosion/weathering
          resistance of quartz-based dimension stones like granite and sandstone.
          Its low porosity and high density (2.6 g/cm³) provide inherent resistance
          to environmental chemical attack, freeze-thaw cycles, and pollutant erosion.
          While not as chemically inert as pure quartzite, its performance in architectural
          applications under general atmospheric conditions is rated as very high.

          bond, has a wide potential strength range (approximately 10-25 MPa). The
          value of 15 MPa represents a typical mid-to-lower range figure suitable

          composed of calcite and other carbonate minerals. Authoritative engineering
          geology texts indicate that the calcite (CaCO₃) in such stones begins to
          dissociate (calcine) in air at temperatures around 600-750°C, with 600°C
          being the conservative threshold for the onset of significant chemical decomposition
          and loss of structural integrity. This is not oxidation in the metallic
          sense, but a thermally-driven chemical breakdown which is the relevant failure
          mode for this material in high-temperature, oxidative environments.
