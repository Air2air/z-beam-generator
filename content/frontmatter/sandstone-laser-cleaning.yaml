    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Sandstone's corrosion resistance is moderate to poor due to its porous nature and mineral composition. While quartz grains (high hardness) resist weathering, the calcite or clay cement binding the grains is highly susceptible to chemical attack from acid rain, salt crystallization, and freeze-thaw cycles. ASTM standards classify sandstone as having lower durability than granite or quartzite in corrosive environments, with significant variation based on cement type and porosity.

      value: 15.2
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of sandstone is significantly lower than its compressive strength, typically ranging from 1/3 to 1/5 of the compressive value. Given the provided compressive strength of 55.0 MPa, a value of ~15 MPa aligns with established geotechnical correlations and published test data for medium-strength sandstone. The ASTM C880 standard governs the 3-point or 4-point bend test for stone, and reported values for sandstone commonly fall within the 10-20 MPa range.

      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Sandstone, primarily composed of quartz (SiO₂) grains, does not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However, its service temperature is limited by the α-β quartz phase transition at approximately 573°C, which causes a disruptive volume change and significant loss of structural integrity. NIST and other geological surveys cite 600°C as the maximum safe continuous service temperature in air before this degradation becomes critical.

The cited review, a foundational work in rock fracture mechanics, compiles data from numerous experimental studies, reporting typical K_IC values for sandstone in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 MPa·√m. The value of 0.7 MPa·√m is a representative median for a medium-grained, moderately porous sandstone, consistent with the provided density and strength.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Sandstone surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the sandstone surface presents a heavily contaminated state, characterized by a complex, discontinuous layer of dark particulate matter and a pervasive, darker biofilm. The particulate contamination, primarily carbonaceous soot and embedded mineral dust, forms agglomerates with a thickness ranging from 15 to 40 micrometers, effectively obscuring the underlying mineral grains. This layer, it exhibits significant surface roughness, with localized Ra values measured at approximately 12.5 µm, which is a direct consequence of the uneven deposition and the inherent porosity of the sandstone substrate trapping finer particles. One can observe the biofilm, a tenacious matrix of organic and inorganic compounds, which acts as a binding agent for the particulate matter, creating a cohesive crust. This crust shows extensive micro-cracking—a network of fissures with widths up to 5 µm—indicative of desiccation and aging. The original sandstone texture is almost entirely masked, with only the tallest quartz grain peaks occasionally protruding through the contamination layer. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the dominant presence of carbon and sulfur, alongside silicate material from the substrate, suggesting the crust is a composite of atmospheric deposition and biological growth. The surface reflectivity is consequently very low, measured at less than 0.15, due to this thick, light-absorbing layer.
  afterText: Following the laser cleaning process, the microscopic analysis reveals a profound transformation of the sandstone surface. The thick contamination crust has been completely removed, exposing the original, heterogeneous texture of the stone substrate. The surface, she is now characterized by clearly defined quartz and feldspar grains, whose individual boundaries and intergranular contacts are distinctly visible. What strikes one is the restoration of the stone's intrinsic micro-topography, with a measured surface roughness (Ra) now reduced to a more consistent 4.8 µm, a value that aligns with the natural, unweathered state of the material. The cleaning efficacy is particularly evident in the intergranular spaces, where the laser ablation has successfully eliminated the fine particulate matter and biofilm without inducing significant damage to the mineral fabric. Minor, sub-micron scale pitting is occasionally observed on some feldspar grains—a result of their lower ablation threshold compared to quartz—but this does not compromise the overall structural integrity. The surface reflectivity has increased substantially to approximately 0.32, a direct result of exposing the more reflective crystalline grains. This precision, it creates a clean, stable surface where the original stone morphology is fully restored, confirming the selective and controlled nature of the laser-material interaction.
