  beforeText: Under the microscope, the sandstone surface reveals a rugged terrain
    marred by irregular pitting and micro-cracks, indicative of degradation from prolonged
    exposure. Embedded contaminants—fine particulate dust, organic residues, and mineral
    salts—clump in porous voids, forming adherent layers that exacerbate erosion.
    This contamination, it weakens the stone's integrity, promoting further spalling
    and loss of textural cohesion.
  afterText: The laser cleaning of sandstone surfaces achieves a pristine condition,
    removing encrustations without altering the stone's natural porosity or grain
    structure. This restoration quality revives the original patina and texture, ensuring
    aesthetic fidelity. Material integrity stays fully preserved, with no microcracks
    or thermal effects—ideal for heritage applications.

        research_basis: Sandstone's corrosion resistance is moderate to poor due to
          its porous nature and mineral composition. While quartz grains (high hardness)
          resist weathering, the calcite or clay cement binding the grains is highly
          susceptible to chemical attack from acid rain, salt crystallization, and
          freeze-thaw cycles. ASTM standards classify sandstone as having lower durability
          than granite or quartzite in corrosive environments, with significant variation
          based on cement type and porosity.

        research_basis: The flexural strength of sandstone is significantly lower
          than its compressive strength, typically ranging from 1/3 to 1/5 of the
          compressive value. Given the provided compressive strength of 55.0 MPa,
          a value of ~15 MPa aligns with established geotechnical correlations and
          published test data for medium-strength sandstone. The ASTM C880 standard
          governs the 3-point or 4-point bend test for stone, and reported values
          for sandstone commonly fall within the 10-20 MPa range.

        research_basis: Sandstone, primarily composed of quartz (SiO₂) grains, does
          not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However, its service temperature
          is limited by the α-β quartz phase transition at approximately 573°C, which
          causes a disruptive volume change and significant loss of structural integrity.
          NIST and other geological surveys cite 600°C as the maximum safe continuous
          service temperature in air before this degradation becomes critical.
