  description: Microscopic analysis of Yttrium surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: This surface analysis at 500x magnification reveals significant contamination
    layers on the yttrium substrate. The primary contaminant appears as a non-uniform
    oxide layer—perhaps Y₂O₃—with measured thickness varying between 8 and 15 micrometers.
    This layer shows a cracked, mudflat morphology, with visible spallation at the
    interface regions. Surface roughness measurements confirm substantial texture
    degradation, with Ra values reaching approximately 12.4 µm. Multiple particulate
    deposits are embedded within the oxide matrix. EDX analysis identifies carbonaceous
    soot (65 at% C) and silicate particles (Si, O, Al) concentrated in surface valleys.
    These contaminants create a mottled, dark-gray appearance that obscures the underlying
    metallic luster. The interface between contamination and substrate shows poor
    adhesion, with delamination cracks measuring 3-7 µm in width. This compromised
    surface integrity would negatively impact functional performance, particularly
    for applications requiring precise reflectivity or thermal conductivity. The contamination
    creates a barrier, so the true surface characteristics cannot be properly evaluated.
  afterText: This laser cleaning process produces dramatic surface transformation,
    very-very good result for material restoration. At 500x magnification, the contaminated
    layer is completely removed, revealing the underlying yttrium substrate with characteristic
    metallic gray appearance. Surface roughness shows remarkable improvement—Ra measurements
    now register 0.8 µm, compared to the initial 12.4 µm. This represents approximately
    94% reduction in surface
