  beforeText: Under microscope, yttrium surface shows contamination very-very severe,
    with fine particles clinging tightly and forming uneven layers. Contaminants appear
    as dark specks and oily films, likely from manufacturing residues in electronics
    or magnet production, then blocking optical clarity. Surface degradation is evident
    in small pits and cracks, so material weakens and loses smoothness, making cleaning
    essential for applications.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, yttrium surface appears very-very smooth
    and clean, free from contaminants. Process removes residues then restores original
    luster, so material integrity stays intact without thermal damage or cracks. Restoration
    quality is high-high, preserving rare-earth properties for electronics and optics
    use. Surface condition supports reliable performance in manufacturing.
