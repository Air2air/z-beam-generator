    compressiveStrength:
      value: 350.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with
        a common class of MMCs like aluminum matrix composites reinforced with silicon
        carbide (SiC). For a typical Al/SiC MMC with ~20-30% reinforcement, the compressive
        strength is often in the range of 300-400 MPa, with 350 MPa being a representative
        mid-range value. The hardness of 55 HRB further supports this strength range
        for a discontinuously reinforced MMC.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: MMCs typically have poor to fair corrosion resistance (2-4/10)
        due to galvanic coupling between the conductive reinforcement (e.g., ceramics
        like SiC) and the metal matrix, creating preferential corrosion sites. While
        specific ratings vary by matrix/reinforcement combination, general environmental
        corrosion resistance is significantly compromised compared to the monolithic
        base metal.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 450.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The oxidation resistance of MMCs is not a single value but is
        highly dependent on the specific matrix alloy (e.g., aluminum, titanium, magnesium)
        and the reinforcement. For the most common class, Aluminum Matrix Composites
        (AMCs), which align with the provided density, the maximum continuous service
        temperature in air is typically limited to 300-450°C. This upper limit is
        due to the rapid degradation of the aluminum matrix and the potential for
        accelerated oxidation at reinforcement/matrix interfaces. The cited ASM Handbook
        provides this range for high-performance AMCs, with 450°C representing a practical
        upper bound before significant oxidation and property loss occur.
