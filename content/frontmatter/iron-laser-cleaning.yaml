  beforeText: Under microscopy, the iron surface appears very-very rough and degraded,
    with deep-deep pits and cracks formed by corrosion. Contaminants, including rust
    oxides and sticky oil residues, cluster and cover the metal, blocking natural
    shine. Surface is weakened so, degradation spreads then makes material brittle
    over time.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the iron surface appears very-very smooth
    and shiny, with dirt and rust removed completely then polished gently. Restoration
    quality is excellent, as the process cleans without heating deeply, so material
    integrity stays strong—no cracks or weakening occur. The metal looks restored
    to original condition, ready for general use and applications.

        ai_verified: true

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure iron is highly dependent
          on its purity, grain size, and temper condition (e.g., cast, wrought, annealed).
          For annealed, relatively pure iron (e.g., Armco iron), the compressive yield
          strength is typically in the range of 150-250 MPa. The value of 200 MPa
          is a representative mid-range figure for general reference. It is significantly
          lower than its tensile strength due to the ductile nature of the metal.

        research_basis: Iron has poor corrosion resistance, readily forming iron oxide
          (rust) in normal atmospheric conditions with moisture and oxygen. While
          pure iron has slightly better resistance than some carbon steels, it still
          receives very low ratings in corrosion resistance scales used by materials
          engineering authorities. NACE guidelines consistently rank iron and mild
          steels among the lowest tier materials for general corrosion resistance.

        research_basis: Flexural strength is not a standard property reported for
          basic metals like pure iron, as it is highly dependent on the material's
          form (cast, wrought), purity, and microstructure. For pure, annealed iron,
          the ultimate tensile strength is typically 150-300 MPa. The flexural strength
          in a 3-point bend test is analogous to the ultimate tensile strength for
          ductile materials. The provided value is a conservative estimate from the
          lower end of the tensile strength range for pure iron, as found in authoritative
          materials handbooks. The confidence is not 1.00 because the value can vary
          significantly with the specific grade and processing of the iron.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness of pure iron is highly dependent on
          grain size and purity. For high-purity, fine-grained iron at room temperature,
          K_IC values are typically in the range of 50-200 MPa·√m. The lower end of
          this range (around 50 MPa·√m) is representative of commercial purity iron,
          which has lower toughness than ultra-high-purity material due to impurity
          segregation and carbide formation. This value aligns with data from standardized
          materials handbooks for general iron.
