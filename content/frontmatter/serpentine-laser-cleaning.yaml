    compressiveStrength:
      value: 170.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of serpentine is highly variable (50-300
        MPa) depending on mineralogical composition (antigorite vs. chrysotile) and
        anisotropy. The provided value of 170 MPa is a median value for massive, blocky
        serpentinite rock used in construction/dimension stone applications, as cited
        in authoritative geotechnical and stone industry references.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Serpentine stones (commercially known as "verde antique" or
        serpentinite marble) are recognized in dimension stone standards for good
        to excellent weathering resistance and durability. While not completely inert,
        serpentine's low porosity and mineral composition provide high resistance
        to atmospheric corrosion, salt spray, and environmental pollutants compared
        to other natural stones. Its main vulnerability is acid attack, which is less
        common in general environmental exposure.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 31.0
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided value is based on a 4-point bend test of massive
        serpentinite rock (antigorite-rich) as reported in USGS geological and engineering
        property compilations. Flexural strength for serpentine is highly dependent
        on its specific mineralogical composition (e.g., antigorite vs. chrysotile),
        texture, and porosity, leading to a typical range of 15-50 MPa. The cited
        value represents a reliable average for competent, non-fibrous serpentinite
        used as a dimension stone.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 500.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 870.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Serpentine minerals (e.g., chrysotile) are hydrous silicates
        that begin to dehydroxylate (lose structural water) around 500-600°C in air,
        which is the primary oxidation/decomposition mechanism rather than reaction
        with oxygen. The 500°C threshold represents the maximum continuous service
        temperature before significant structural breakdown and mass loss begins.
