  beforeText: Under microscopy, Serpentine's surface reveals clustered dust grains
    and organic films, eroding its fibrous texture. This contamination dulls optical
    clarity for laser calibration tools.
  afterText: After cleaning, the Serpentine stone surface regains its smooth, polished
    finish and vivid green tones, with no etching or discoloration. This restoration
    maintains full material integrity, supporting durable applications in architectural
    countertops for everyday use.

          to excellent weathering resistance and durability. While not completely
          inert, serpentine's low porosity and mineral composition provide high resistance
          to atmospheric corrosion, salt spray, and environmental pollutants compared
          to other natural stones. Its main vulnerability is acid attack, which is
          less common in general environmental exposure.

          on its specific mineralogical composition (e.g., antigorite vs. chrysotile),
          texture, and porosity, leading to a typical range of 15-50 MPa. The cited

          used as a dimension stone.

        research_basis: Serpentine minerals (e.g., chrysotile) are hydrous silicates
          that begin to dehydroxylate (lose structural water) around 500-600°C in
          air, which is the primary oxidation/decomposition mechanism rather than
          reaction with oxygen. The 500°C threshold represents the maximum continuous
          service temperature before significant structural breakdown and mass loss
          begins.
