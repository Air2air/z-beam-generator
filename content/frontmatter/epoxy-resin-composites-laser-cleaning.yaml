    compressiveStrength:
      value: 110.0
      min: 50
      max: 1000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of epoxy resin composites is highly
        dependent on the type and volume fraction of reinforcing fibers (e.g., carbon,
        glass). For a typical structural composite with a moderate fiber volume fraction
        (50-60%), the compressive strength generally falls in the range of 80-150
        MPa. The provided value of 110 MPa is a representative median for a glass/epoxy
        composite system, which is the most common type. The known properties (high
        hardness, density) are consistent with a filled or reinforced epoxy system,
        but without specific reinforcement details, this is an estimated range.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 5
      max: 9
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Epoxy resin composites exhibit excellent resistance to a wide
        range of chemicals, solvents, and moisture, with degradation primarily limited
        to strong oxidizing acids and certain alkalis. The polymer matrix provides
        a protective barrier, making them superior to metals in most corrosive environments,
        though not as universally resistant as some fluoropolymers.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 100.0
      min: 100
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Epoxy resin composites typically exhibit flexural strengths
        in the 80-120 MPa range for standard formulations, though this varies significantly
        with fiber type, fiber content, and filler materials. The provided properties
        (density, hardness) are consistent with typical filled or reinforced epoxy
        composites. While the given properties don't directly predict flexural strength,
        they help confirm this is a standard epoxy composite material where 3-point
        bend testing commonly yields values in this range.
    hardness:
      value: 85.0
      min: 5.0
      max: 120
      unit: Shore D
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 21: Composites, Section: Polymer Matrix
        Composites, pp. 243-257 (2001) with specific reference to epoxy resin composite
        formulations containing 60-70% fiberglass reinforcement'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      min: 80.0
      max: 1650.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for standard epoxy
        resins in an air/oxidizing environment is typically 130-150°C. Above this
        range, thermal degradation and oxidation processes accelerate, leading to
        significant loss of mechanical properties. The provided material properties
        (85 Shore D hardness, 1000 J·kg⁻¹·K⁻¹ specific heat) are consistent with a
        standard cured epoxy system, supporting this temperature range assessment.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.6
      min: 20
      max: 100
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Epoxy resins typically have low fracture toughness (0.5-0.8
        MPa·√m) due to their brittle thermoset nature. While fiber reinforcement can
        significantly improve toughness, the provided properties (density 1.25 g/cm³,
        hardness 85 Shore D) suggest an unfilled or minimally filled epoxy system,
        consistent with the lower end of this range. The cited ASM Handbook provides
        characteristic values for unreinforced epoxy polymers.
