caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy shows the epoxy resin composite surface rough and dotted
    with fine dust particles and oily residues. This causes pitting, and slight degradation
    appears.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of the epoxy resin composite now looks smooth and
    even, free from contaminants like oils or particles. This restoration demonstrates
    good quality, and it preserves the material's integrity without any damage to
    its layered structure. The process restores functionality effectively, keeping
    strength and durability intact for everyday applications.

      compressiveStrength:
        ai_verified: true
        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: The compressive strength of epoxy resin composites is highly
          dependent on the type and volume fraction of reinforcing fibers (e.g., carbon,
          glass). For a typical structural composite with a moderate fiber volume
          fraction (50-60%), the compressive strength generally falls in the range
          of 80-150 MPa. The provided value of 110 MPa is a representative median
          for a glass/epoxy composite system, which is the most common type. The known
          properties (high hardness, density) are consistent with a filled or reinforced
          epoxy system, but without specific reinforcement details, this is an estimated
          range.

          to strong oxidizing acids and certain alkalis. The polymer matrix provides
          a protective barrier, making them superior to metals in most corrosive environments,
          though not as universally resistant as some fluoropolymers.

          with fiber type, fiber content, and filler materials. The provided properties
          (density, hardness) are consistent with typical filled or reinforced epoxy
          composites. While the given properties don't directly predict flexural strength,
          they help confirm this is a standard epoxy composite material where 3-point
          bend testing commonly yields values in this range.

          resins in an air/oxidizing environment is typically 130-150°C. Above this
          range, thermal degradation and oxidation processes accelerate, leading to
          significant loss of mechanical properties. The provided material properties
          (85 Shore D hardness, 1000 J·kg⁻¹·K⁻¹ specific heat) are consistent with
          a standard cured epoxy system, supporting this temperature range assessment.

          can significantly improve toughness, the provided properties (density 1.25
