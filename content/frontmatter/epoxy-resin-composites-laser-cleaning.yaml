  beforeText: Microscopy shows the epoxy resin composite surface rough and dotted with fine dust particles and oily residues.
    This causes pitting, and slight degradation appears.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of the epoxy resin composite now looks smooth and even, free from contaminants like oils
    or particles. This restoration demonstrates good quality, and it preserves the material's integrity without any damage
    to its layered structure. The process restores functionality effectively, keeping strength and durability intact for everyday
    applications.

faq:
- question: Can you safely remove epoxy resin from a composite surface with a laser without damaging the underlying carbon
    or glass fibers?
  answer: Yes, with precise 1064 nm wavelength and 2.5 J/cm² fluence control, you can selectively ablate the epoxy matrix.
    The key is ensuring the laser's energy is absorbed by the resin before penetrating to the underlying fibers, thus preventing
    their exposure or thermal degradation.
- question: What is the best laser wavelength (e.g., 1064nm, 532nm, or 355nm) for cleaning epoxy composite surfaces without
    causing yellowing or chemical changes?
  answer: For epoxy composite cleaning, 355nm UV lasers are optimal. This wavelength enables photochemical ablation below
    the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold, efficiently breaking molecular bonds without significant heat generation. This process
    prevents the thermal degradation that causes yellowing, preserving the chemical integrity of the polymer matrix.
- question: How do you clean contaminated epoxy composites (e.g., mold release, grease, paint) with a laser without just embedding
    the contaminants deeper?
  answer: Using nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with fluence above 2.5 J/cm², we selectively ablate contaminants.
    This process vaporizes surface layers without melting the epoxy, effectively lifting material away to prevent infusion.
- question: Does laser cleaning epoxy composites release hazardous fumes, and what specific filtration or extraction is required?
  answer: Yes, laser ablation of epoxy composites at 2.5 J/cm² releases hazardous pyrolysis byproducts like benzene and phenol.
    You must use a high-efficiency fume extraction system with HEPA and activated carbon filtration, coupled with appropriate
    respiratory protection for operators.
- question: What laser parameters should I use to ablate a precise depth of epoxy resin for repair or inspection purposes?
  answer: For controlled epoxy resin ablation, maintain fluence near 2.5 J/cm² with a 50 µm spot size. Adjust the number of
    passes and a 50% beam overlap to precisely manage depth removal, even on uneven composite surfaces.
- question: After laser cleaning an epoxy composite, is the surface properly activated for bonding, or does it require a secondary
    treatment?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² fluence activates epoxy composites by increasing surface energy and creating micro-roughness.
    This typically provides excellent adhesion readiness, often eliminating the need for secondary treatments like abrasion,
    unlike mechanical methods that can leave contaminants.
- question: Why does my laser-cleaned epoxy composite surface sometimes look hazy or have a changed texture?
  answer: Hazing often results from excessive fluence above 2.5 J/cm², which thermally degrades the epoxy matrix. This creates
    micro-roughness from selective resin removal. Optimize your scan speed near 500 mm/s and manage overlap to minimize heat
    accumulation for a clearer surface.
- question: Is laser cleaning effective for removing carbonized epoxy after a fire or thermal event?
  answer: Laser cleaning can remove carbonized epoxy, but requires precise fluence control near 2.5 J/cm². The char layer's
    altered absorption risks damaging underlying fibers, demanding careful parameter tuning to selectively ablate residue
    without harming the composite substrate.
- question: How does the performance of laser cleaning epoxy composites compare to traditional methods like grit blasting
    or chemical stripping?
  answer: Laser cleaning outperforms traditional methods by selectively removing epoxy at 2.5 J/cm² fluence without damaging
    underlying fibers. This non-contact process eliminates secondary waste from grit or chemicals, offering superior surface
    preservation. With precise control at 500 mm/s scan speeds, it ensures consistent, high-quality results for critical aerospace
    and marine components.
- question: What are the critical safety considerations when using a high-power laser on an epoxy composite, beyond standard
    laser safety?
  answer: Beyond standard laser protocols, the primary concern is toxic fume generation from the 1064 nm ablation process.
    At the 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold, epoxy decomposes into hazardous compounds, necessitating integrated fume extraction
    with real-time air monitoring to protect personnel from these carcinogenic byproducts.
