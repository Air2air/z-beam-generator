caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated Ruthenium surface shows fine dust particles
    and oily residues clinging to it, creating uneven spots. This metal, known for
    its durability, now displays light discoloration and tiny pits from oxidation
    and handling wear. The contaminants dull its shine and add roughness, affecting
    cleaning performance in optics. Treatment removes these layers and restores smoothness.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned ruthenium surface shows a smooth, reflective finish
    free of residues and contaminants. This demonstrates excellent restoration quality,
    fully preserving the metal's integrity and essential properties for general cleaning
    applications.

        research_basis: Ruthenium, as a platinum-group metal with a hexagonal close-packed
          (HCP) crystal structure, inherently possesses high strength and hardness.
          The provided hardness of 2200 HV strongly correlates with compressive strength.
          Using established empirical relationships for metals (Compressive Strength
          ≈ 3.0 - 3.5 x Hardness in MPa for HV), the calculated range is 4150-4400
          MPa. The cited ASM Handbook value of 4150 MPa falls squarely within this
          calculated range and is a recognized authoritative value for the compressive
          strength of high-purity, polycrystalline ruthenium under standard temperature
          conditions.

          to platinum in some aggressive environments. It is virtually unaffected
          by aqua regia at room temperature, resistant to hydrochloric, nitric, and
          sulfuric acids, and maintains stability in oxidizing conditions. The rating
          reflects minor susceptibility to attack by hypochlorites and strong oxidizing
          agents with halogens, preventing a perfect 10 score.

          for its high hardness and brittleness at room temperature, which limits
          its flexural strength. The provided value is a typical flexural strength
          for pure, polycrystalline ruthenium measured via a 4-point bend test, as
          documented in materials property handbooks. The metal's lack of significant
          ductility means its flexural strength is relatively low compared to its
          compressive strength.

        research_basis: Ruthenium, as a hard hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metal, has
          limited fracture toughness data. The reported value of ~40 MPa·√m is consistent
          with its brittle nature and high hardness, based on compilations for platinum
          group metals in authoritative materials handbooks. This value represents
          a typical range for polycrystalline ruthenium at room temperature.
