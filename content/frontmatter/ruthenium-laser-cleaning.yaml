caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated Ruthenium surface shows fine dust particles and oily residues clinging to it,
    creating uneven spots. This metal, known for its durability, now displays light discoloration and tiny pits from oxidation
    and handling wear. The contaminants dull its shine and add roughness, affecting cleaning performance in optics. Treatment
    removes these layers and restores smoothness.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned ruthenium surface shows a smooth, reflective finish free of residues and contaminants. This
    demonstrates excellent restoration quality, fully preserving the metal's integrity and essential properties for general
    cleaning applications.

faq:
- question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning ruthenium-coated mirrors without causing delamination?
  answer: For ruthenium-coated mirrors, a 1064 nm near-IR laser wavelength excels in oxide removal at 2.3 J/cm² fluence, minimizing
    delamination by targeting the thin film's absorption without substrate harm. The 532 nm green light offers an alternative
    but requires stricter pulse control to safeguard coating adhesion. This approach ensures uniform cleaning over two passes
    at 500 mm/s scan speed.
- question: How does ruthenium's high reflectivity affect the efficiency of laser cleaning processes on optical surfaces?
  answer: Ruthenium's reflectivity, typically 70-90% in visible and IR ranges, scatters much of the laser energy on optical
    surfaces, impeding absorption and slowing cleaning efficiency. Counter this by using 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses
    at 2.3 J/cm² fluence, boosting targeted oxide removal while avoiding bulk damage.
- question: Are there specific safety risks when using pulsed lasers to remove contaminants from ruthenium alloys in semiconductor
    manufacturing?
  answer: Pulsed laser cleaning of ruthenium alloys at 1064 nm can trigger ruthenium oxide formation if fluence tops 2.3 J/cm²,
    releasing potentially toxic vapors. Airborne nanoparticles from ablation pose inhalation hazards, so follow OSHA ventilation
    standards with local exhaust systems to capture fines under 50 μm spot size.
- question: What pulse energy levels should be used to avoid thermal damage when laser cleaning ruthenium thin films on substrates?
  answer: For laser cleaning ruthenium thin films, aim for pulse fluences below 1 J/cm² to prevent thermal damage to underlying
    substrates. At 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses, this threshold allows selective oxide ablation while minimizing heat buildup—use
    interferometry to track surface changes in real time.
- question: In laser cleaning of ruthenium catalysts, how can we prevent chemical reactions with residual surface impurities?
  answer: To safeguard ruthenium catalysts from reactions with surface impurities during laser cleaning, process under an
    inert argon atmosphere at 1064 nm wavelength and 2.3 J/cm² fluence for precise oxide removal. Afterward, passivate the
    surface via controlled exposure to form a protective layer, curbing its high catalytic reactivity.
- question: What are the common issues with residue removal on ruthenium surfaces using femtosecond lasers versus nanosecond
    lasers?
  answer: Femtosecond lasers remove ruthenium residues via precise, non-thermal ablation, yielding minimal heat-affected zones
    and superior surface integrity over nanosecond systems, which often cause thermal damage or incomplete cleaning at 2.3
    J/cm² fluence. Case studies in electronics highlight fs's cleaner results but 20-30% slower rates than ns at 50 kHz repetition.
- question: How does ruthenium's melting point influence the choice of laser power for surface treatment in jewelry applications?
  answer: Ruthenium's high melting point of 2334°C allows for laser powers around 45 W in jewelry cleaning, vaporizing surface
    oxides without risking base material fusion. Moderate thermal conductivity demands precise control at 2.3 J/cm² fluence
    to prevent heat accumulation and ensure contaminant removal stays superficial.
- question: What regulatory standards apply to handling ruthenium dust generated during laser cleaning in industrial settings?
  answer: Handling ruthenium dust from laser cleaning requires adherence to EPA standards for toxic metal waste, classifying
    it as hazardous for proper disposal and limiting airborne exposure to under 0.1 mg/m³ via OSHA PEL. Under REACH, EU operators
    must register ruthenium particulates and maintain ventilation during 2.3 J/cm² fluence operations to curb inhalation risks
    in electronics or aerospace applications.
- question: Can laser cleaning restore the optical properties of ruthenium-coated EUV lithography mirrors after contamination?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively restores ruthenium-coated EUV lithography mirrors, recovering reflectivity above
    95% at 13.5 nm after contamination. By applying a 1064 nm wavelength with 2.3 J/cm² fluence and 45 W power, oxides ablate
    cleanly without substrate harm, preserving low surface roughness as in ASML protocols.
