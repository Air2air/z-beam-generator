  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated Ruthenium surface shows fine dust particles and oily residues clinging to it, creating uneven spots. This metal, known for its durability, now displays light discoloration and tiny pits from oxidation and handling wear. The contaminants dull its shine and add roughness, affecting cleaning performance in optics. Treatment removes these layers and restores smoothness.

title: Ruthenium Laser Cleaning
faq:
- question: What laser wavelengths are most effective for cleaning ruthenium-coated mirrors without causing delamination?
  answer: For ruthenium-coated mirrors, a 1064 nm near-IR laser wavelength excels in oxide removal at 2.3 J/cm² fluence, minimizing delamination by targeting the thin film's absorption without substrate harm. The 532 nm green light offers an alternative but requires stricter pulse control to safeguard coating adhesion. This approach ensures uniform cleaning over two passes at 500 mm/s scan speed.
- question: How does ruthenium's high reflectivity affect the efficiency of laser cleaning processes on optical surfaces?
  answer: Ruthenium's reflectivity, typically 70-90% in visible and IR ranges, scatters much of the laser energy on optical surfaces, impeding absorption and slowing cleaning efficiency. Counter this by using 1064 nm wavelength with 8 ns pulses at 2.3 J/cm² fluence, boosting targeted oxide removal while avoiding bulk damage.
- question: Are there specific safety risks when using pulsed lasers to remove contaminants from ruthenium alloys in semiconductor manufacturing?
  answer: Pulsed laser cleaning of ruthenium alloys at 1064 nm can trigger ruthenium oxide formation if fluence tops 2.3 J/cm², releasing potentially toxic vapors. Airborne nanoparticles from ablation pose inhalation hazards, so follow OSHA ventilation standards with local exhaust systems to capture fines under 50 μm spot size.
- question: What pulse energy levels should be used to avoid thermal damage when laser cleaning ruthenium thin films on substrates?
  answer: For laser cleaning ruthenium thin films, aim for pulse fluences below 1 J/cm² to prevent thermal damage to underlying substrates. At 1064 nm with 8 ns pulses, this threshold allows selective oxide ablation while minimizing heat buildup—use interferometry to track surface changes in real time.
- question: In laser cleaning of ruthenium catalysts, how can we prevent chemical reactions with residual surface impurities?
  answer: To safeguard ruthenium catalysts from reactions with surface impurities during laser cleaning, process under an inert argon atmosphere at 1064 nm wavelength and 2.3 J/cm² fluence for precise oxide removal. Afterward, passivate the surface via controlled exposure to form a protective layer, curbing its high catalytic reactivity.
- question: What are the common issues with residue removal on ruthenium surfaces using femtosecond lasers versus nanosecond lasers?
  answer: Femtosecond lasers remove ruthenium residues via precise, non-thermal ablation, yielding minimal heat-affected zones and superior surface integrity over nanosecond systems, which often cause thermal damage or incomplete cleaning at 2.3 J/cm² fluence. Case studies in electronics highlight fs's cleaner results but 20-30% slower rates than ns at 50 kHz repetition.
- question: How does ruthenium's melting point influence the choice of laser power for surface treatment in jewelry applications?
  answer: Ruthenium's high melting point of 2334°C allows for laser powers around 45 W in jewelry cleaning, vaporizing surface oxides without risking base material fusion. Moderate thermal conductivity demands precise control at 2.3 J/cm² fluence to prevent heat accumulation and ensure contaminant removal stays superficial.
- question: What regulatory standards apply to handling ruthenium dust generated during laser cleaning in industrial settings?
  answer: Handling ruthenium dust from laser cleaning requires adherence to EPA standards for toxic metal waste, classifying it as hazardous for proper disposal and limiting airborne exposure to under 0.1 mg/m³ via OSHA PEL. Under REACH, EU operators must register ruthenium particulates and maintain ventilation during 2.3 J/cm² fluence operations to curb inhalation risks in electronics or aerospace applications.
- question: Can laser cleaning restore the optical properties of ruthenium-coated EUV lithography mirrors after contamination?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively restores ruthenium-coated EUV lithography mirrors, recovering reflectivity above 95% at 13.5 nm after contamination. By applying a 1064 nm wavelength with 2.3 J/cm² fluence and 45 W power, oxides ablate cleanly without substrate harm, preserving low surface roughness as in ASML protocols.
