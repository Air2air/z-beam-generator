caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the cast iron surface appears very-very rough and
    is covered densely by contaminants. These contaminants show as clustered dark
    particles and oily residues, so surface degrades with visible pits, cracks, and
    oxidation layers. The condition looks damaged and uneven, then requires careful
    cleaning.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the cast iron surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean, with contaminants removed then oxidized layers lifted away.
    The process restores original texture so precisely, and material integrity remains
    intact—no cracks or weakening occurs. Surface is polished by laser action, enhancing
    durability for general applications, while preserving metal's strong, heat-resistant
    properties. Restoration quality is high-high, ideal for long-lasting use.
