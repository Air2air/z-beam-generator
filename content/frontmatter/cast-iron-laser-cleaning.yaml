  beforeText: Under microscopy, the cast iron surface appears very-very rough and is covered densely by contaminants. These
    contaminants show as clustered dark particles and oily residues, so surface degrades with visible pits, cracks, and oxidation
    layers. The condition looks damaged and uneven, then requires careful cleaning.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the cast iron surface appears very-very smooth and clean, with contaminants removed
    then oxidized layers lifted away. The process restores original texture so precisely, and material integrity remains intact—no
    cracks or weakening occurs. Surface is polished by laser action, enhancing durability for general applications, while
    preserving metal's strong, heat-resistant properties. Restoration quality is high-high, ideal for long-lasting use.

faq:
- question: What laser parameters work best for cleaning rust from cast iron without damaging the base metal?
  answer: Untuk membersihkan karat dari besi cor tanpa merusak substrat, gunakan laser serat 1064 nm dengan daya ~100 W dan
    fluens 5 J/cm². Kecepatan pemindaian 500 mm/s dengan spot 50 μm memberikan ablasi oksida yang efektif, melestarikan mikrostruktur
    logam dasar melalui kontrol energi pulsa nanodetik yang tepat.
- question: Does laser cleaning affect the machinability or future processing of cast iron components?
  answer: Laser cleaning with optimal 5 J/cm² fluence and 100W power preserves cast iron's machinability by removing oxides
    without altering bulk hardness. The process leaves a pristine surface that enhances coating adhesion and maintains weldability,
    ensuring no adverse effects on subsequent manufacturing steps.
- question: How do I prevent white cast iron from cracking during laser cleaning due to thermal stress?
  answer: Untuk mencegah retak pada white cast iron, gunakan fluence rendah mendekati 5 J/cm² dan scan speed tinggi ~500 mm/s.
    Strategi ini meminimalkan thermal shock dengan membatasi input panas pada material getas berkarbon tinggi.
- question: Can laser cleaning effectively remove burned-in sand and casting residues from iron castings?
  answer: Ya, laser pembersih sangat efektif untuk menghilangkan residu pengecoran dari besi tuang. Dengan fluence ~5 J/cm²
    dan kecepatan scan 500 mm/s, proses ini mengablasikan pasir yang terbakar dan agen pelepas cetakan dari permukaan berpori
    tanpa merusak substrat.
- question: What safety precautions are needed when laser cleaning cast iron containing graphite?
  answer: Cast iron's graphite content generates hazardous ultrafine particulates during ablation at 100W power. Implement
    local exhaust ventilation with HEPA filtration and wear a P100 respirator. The 1064nm wavelength process demands full-face
    protection against reflected radiation.
- question: Does laser cleaning alter the corrosion resistance of cast iron surfaces?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 5 J/cm² fluence actually enhances corrosion resistance by removing contaminants and creating a
    refined surface layer. This process promotes superior passive oxide formation compared to mechanical methods, significantly
    improving rust protection for cast iron components.
- question: How does the graphite flake structure in gray iron affect laser cleaning results?
  answer: Graphite flakes in gray iron selectively absorb the 1064 nm laser energy, causing preferential ablation at fluences
    around 5 J/cm². This can create micro-pitting, leading to a rougher final surface finish compared to other cast iron microstructures.
- question: What's the maximum material removal rate for heavy scale on cast iron without causing damage?
  answer: Untuk scale tebal pada besi cor, laju pembersihan maksimum sekitar 0.3 m²/jam dapat dicapai dengan fluence 5 J/cm².
    Kecepatan scan 500 mm/s dengan beberapa pass lebih aman untuk mencegah pemanasan substrat berlebihan dan mempertahankan
    integritas permukaan.
- question: Can laser cleaning restore sealing surfaces on cast iron engine blocks or pump housings?
  answer: Laser cleaning effectively restores cast iron sealing surfaces using 5 J/cm² fluence and 50 μm spot size. This selectively
    ablates gasket residue and oxides while preserving the substrate's flatness. The process maintains dimensional integrity,
    creating an ideal surface for re-sealing without mechanical damage.
- question: How do I verify laser cleaning hasn't compromised the structural integrity of critical cast iron components?
  answer: Proper parameter control below 5 J/cm² fluence prevents cast iron's structural compromise. Post-cleaning, employ
    microhardness testing and eddy current inspection to verify subsurface integrity. These NDT methods detect any potential
    alterations in the material's mechanical properties, ensuring component reliability.
