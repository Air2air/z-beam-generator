caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic examination, the chromium surface reveals a pitted
    and uneven topography, marred by adherent contaminants like fine dust particles
    and organic residues that form irregular clusters. These contaminants, often sub-micron
    in size, promote localized oxidation, leading to surface degradation through micro-cracks
    and tarnish layers. This compromises reflectivity in laser optics cleaning applications,
    necessitating precise removal to restore integrity.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the chromium surface restores to a pristine, mirror-like
    condition, free of residues and defects. In laser optics manufacturing, like at
    Coherent Inc., this yields high restoration quality, fully preserving material
    integrity—including the metal's hardness, reflectivity, and corrosion resistance—without
    any pitting or degradation.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed chromium is significantly
          lower than its tensile strength due to its brittle nature. The cited value
          is a typical room-temperature compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) for
          high-purity chromium, as reported in a leading materials science reference.
          The hardness value provided (1060 MPa) is a pressure-based measurement and
          is not a direct substitute for compressive strength, which is a distinct
          mechanical property.
