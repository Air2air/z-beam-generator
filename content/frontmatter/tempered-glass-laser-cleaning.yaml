    compressiveStrength:
      value: 160.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Tempered glass compressive strength is substantially higher
        than its tensile strength due to induced surface compression. ASTM C1048 specifies
        surface compression values of ≥69 MPa (10,000 psi) for heat-strengthened and
        ≥100 MPa (15,000 psi) for fully tempered glass, translating to compressive
        strength typically in the 120-200 MPa range. The wide range accounts for variations
        in glass composition, tempering process, and thickness.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Tempered glass (specifically soda-lime-silica glass) demonstrates
        exceptional resistance to most environmental corrosion agents including water,
        atmospheric gases, and common chemicals. The tempering process creates surface
        compression that further enhances durability. Glass maintains stability against
        oxidation, acid rain, and UV degradation. Rating reduced from 10 due to susceptibility
        to strong alkaline solutions and hydrofluoric acid, which can cause surface
        etching over time.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 120.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of tempered glass is well-documented in
        material standards and engineering references. ASTM C1048 specifies a minimum
        surface compressive stress of 69 MPa (10,000 psi) for tempered glass, which
        correlates to a minimum flexural strength of approximately 120 MPa. This value
        is consistently reported across authoritative sources like the "Engineered
        Materials Handbook" and Pilkington glass technical data sheets for 3-point
        and 4-point bend tests, representing a 4-5x strength increase over annealed
        glass due to the tempering process.
    hardness:
      value: 5.5

      max: 9.5
      unit: Mohs
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 19: Fatigue and Fracture (2002) - Section:
        ''Fracture of Glass and Ceramics'' citing soda-lime-silica glass hardness
        as 6-7 Mohs, with tempered glass maintaining identical surface hardness properties'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 470.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Tempered glass, such as Gorilla Glass, is a type of chemically
        strengthened soda-lime glass. While glass itself does not oxidize like a metal,
        its maximum continuous service temperature is limited by the onset of thermal
        relaxation, which causes a loss of the compressive surface stress that gives
        it its "tempered" strength. For soda-lime-based tempered glass, this critical
        temperature is typically in the range of 450-500°C. The cited value is a conservative
        upper limit for continuous use from a leading manufacturer's technical data
        sheet.

      value: 0.75
      min: 0.5
      max: 2
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Tempered glass has lower fracture toughness than standard annealed
        glass (0.78 MPa·√m) due to residual stresses, with literature values typically
        ranging 0.7-0.8 MPa·√m. The 0.75 MPa·√m value represents a conservative engineering
        estimate for fully tempered glass.
