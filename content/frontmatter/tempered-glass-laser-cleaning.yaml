  description: Microscopic analysis of Tempered Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: "Under microscopic scrutiny, the tempered glass surface displays a heavily\
    \ contaminated condition, with adherent particulates of irregular morphology.\
    \ These contaminants\u2014fine silica dust and hydrocarbon residues, ranging 2-15\
    \ microns\u2014feature porous textures and clustered formations. Degradation manifests\
    \ as etched pits and incipient microcracks, undermining durability in aerospace\
    \ and electronics uses."
  afterText: The cleaned surface of this tempered glass exhibits a pristine, uniform
    finish, free from residues or micro-defects that could compromise its optical
    clarity. Restoration via laser-based additive manufacturing achieves exceptional
    quality, seamlessly reintegrating material layers without altering the inherent
    compressive stresses. Integrity remains fully intact, ensuring reliability for
    aerospace, automotive, and electronics applications.
