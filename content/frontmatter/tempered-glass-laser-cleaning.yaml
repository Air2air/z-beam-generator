  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the tempered glass surface displays a heavily
    contaminated condition, with adherent particulates of irregular morphology. These
    contaminants—fine silica dust and hydrocarbon residues, ranging 2-15 microns—feature
    porous textures and clustered formations. Degradation manifests as etched pits
    and incipient microcracks, undermining durability in aerospace and electronics
    uses.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of this tempered glass exhibits a pristine, uniform
    finish, free from residues or micro-defects that could compromise its optical
    clarity. Restoration via laser-based additive manufacturing achieves exceptional
    quality, seamlessly reintegrating material layers without altering the inherent
    compressive stresses. Integrity remains fully intact, ensuring reliability for
    aerospace, automotive, and electronics applications.
