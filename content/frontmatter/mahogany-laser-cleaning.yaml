  beforeText: Under microscopic view, mahogany's contaminated surface displays adhered
    dust particles and oily residues on wood fibers, causing micro-pitting and fiber
    swelling. Contaminants, 1-10 μm irregular specks, unevenly coat the area, degrading
    smoothness for laser-based woodworking applications.
  afterText: After meticulous cleaning, the mahogany surface emerges smooth and radiant,
    its rich grain patterns revitalized without streaks or haze. Restoration quality
    excels, preserving the wood's natural density and moisture balance to prevent
    cracking or fading. This approach upholds material integrity fully, ideal for
    optical lab furniture where precise surface clarity supports laser alignment in
    California tech firms.

          It performs well against environmental corrosion factors including moisture,
          fungal decay, and insect infestation. The wood contains natural oils and
          extractives that provide moderate protection against biological degradation,
          though it's not as resistant as pressure-treated woods or tropical hardwoods
          like teak.

          degradation (pyrolysis) and oxidative damage between 150-200°C. The 150°C
          threshold represents the maximum continuous service temperature where mechanical
          properties remain stable and charring/weight loss from oxidation becomes
          measurable over time. This is consistent with thermal decomposition data
          for lignocellulosic materials where hemicellulose degradation begins around
