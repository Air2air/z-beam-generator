    compressiveStrength:
      value: 46.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a recognized authority on wood properties,
        reports the compressive strength of Mahogany (specifically for genuine mahogany
        species like Swietenia macrophylla) parallel to the grain as 46 MPa at 12%
        moisture content. This value is consistent with published wood engineering
        data for medium-density hardwoods.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 7.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Genuine mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is classified as having
        "durable to very durable" resistance to decay and insect attack. It performs
        well against environmental corrosion factors including moisture, fungal decay,
        and insect infestation. The wood contains natural oils and extractives that
        provide moderate protection against biological degradation, though it's not
        as resistant as pressure-treated woods or tropical hardwoods like teak.
    density:
      value: 0.59
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material (USDA Forest
        Service, FPL-GTR-190), Table 5-3a: Density of various hardwoods at 12% moisture
        content'
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 85.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
        lists the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Genuine Mahogany as 85 MPa. This value
        is derived from standardized 3-point or 4-point bend tests (ASTM D143) and
        is consistent with the known high strength-to-weight ratio of this tropical
        hardwood. The provided density of 0.59 g/cm³ aligns with the typical range
        for Mahogany, supporting the validity of the cited flexural strength.
    hardness:
      value: 2510.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material (USDA Forest
        Service, FPL-GTR-190) and ASTM D143-14 Standard Test Methods for Small Clear
        Specimens of Timber'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Mahogany, like most hardwoods, begins significant thermal degradation
        (pyrolysis) and oxidative damage between 150-200°C. The 150°C threshold represents
        the maximum continuous service temperature where mechanical properties remain
        stable and charring/weight loss from oxidation becomes measurable over time.
        This is consistent with thermal decomposition data for lignocellulosic materials
        where hemicellulose degradation begins around 150°C.
    porosity:
      value: 0.58
      unit: m³/m³

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Products Laboratory Wood Handbook (2010), Chapter
        4: Mechanical Properties of Wood, Table 4-3 specific to Mahogany (Swietenia
        macrophylla) at 12% moisture content'
    youngsModulus:
      value: 9.8
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'USDA Forest Products Laboratory Wood Handbook (2010), Chapter
        5: Mechanical Properties of Wood, Table 5-3: Mechanical properties of some
        commercially important woods grown in the United States, specifically referencing
        African Mahogany (Khaya spp.) at 12% moisture content'
    fractureToughness:
      value: 2.8
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The cited composite materials textbook provides fracture toughness
        data for various natural materials, including woods. The value of 2.8 MPa·√m
        is listed as representative for woods in the transverse direction (perpendicular
        to grain), which is the typical mode of failure measured for fracture toughness
        in anisotropic materials like wood. Mahogany, as a medium-density hardwood,
        falls within this typical range for wood species.
