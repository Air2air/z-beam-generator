        research_basis: Genuine mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is classified as
          having "durable to very durable" resistance to decay and insect attack.
          It performs well against environmental corrosion factors including moisture,
          fungal decay, and insect infestation. The wood contains natural oils and
          extractives that provide moderate protection against biological degradation,
          though it's not as resistant as pressure-treated woods or tropical hardwoods
          like teak.

          for Wood Products"'
        research_basis: Mahogany, like most hardwoods, begins significant thermal
          degradation (pyrolysis) and oxidative damage between 150-200°C. The 150°C
          threshold represents the maximum continuous service temperature where mechanical
          properties remain stable and charring/weight loss from oxidation becomes
          measurable over time. This is consistent with thermal decomposition data
          for lignocellulosic materials where hemicellulose degradation begins around
          150°C.

        research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
          lists the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Genuine Mahogany as 85 MPa. This
          value is derived from standardized 3-point or 4-point bend tests (ASTM D143)
          and is consistent with the known high strength-to-weight ratio of this tropical
          hardwood. The provided density of 0.59 g/cm³ aligns with the typical range
          for Mahogany, supporting the validity of the cited flexural strength.
