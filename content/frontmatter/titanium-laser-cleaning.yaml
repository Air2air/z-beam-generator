  beforeText: Under microscopy, the titanium surface appears uneven with scattered
    dark contaminants, likely oxide particles and residues from processing. These
    clusters create rough patches and micro-pits, degrading smoothness. This condition,
    it shows, could weaken performance in aerospace or automotive uses, and calls
    for cleaning before laser treatment.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the titanium surface shows a smooth, contaminant-free
    finish with no visible residues. This restoration demonstrates high quality, fully
    preserving material integrity and microstructure. The metal's strength and corrosion
    resistance remain intact, and no defects like pitting appear. It supports durable
    performance in aerospace, automotive, and chemical processing applications.

    description: Titanium laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste streams by removing
      surface contaminants through ablation, avoiding the hazardous etchants and solvents
      traditionally required for titanium surface preparation. This provides a dry,
      residue-free process ideal for high-purity applications in semiconductor, medical,
      and nuclear industries.
    quantifiedBenefits: Chemical waste elimination in Titanium laser cleaning reduces
      hazardous waste disposal by 100%, cuts operational costs by 15%, and increases
      processing throughput by 20%.
- Water Usage Reduction:
    applicableIndustries: []
    description: Titanium's tenacious oxide layer is removed without the chemical
      dissolution or abrasive media blasting that typically generates large volumes
      of contaminated water waste. The laser process ablates contaminants directly,
      eliminating the need for water-based rinsing or slurry handling.
- Energy Efficiency:
    applicableIndustries: []
    description: Titanium's low thermal conductivity confines laser energy to the
      surface contaminant layer, enabling its removal with minimal energy transfer
      into the substrate. This precise ablation process significantly reduces the
      total energy consumption compared to conventional thermal cleaning methods.
- Air Quality Improvement:
    applicableIndustries: []
    description: Titanium laser cleaning eliminates airborne particulate matter by
      selectively ablating contaminants without vaporizing the underlying substrate,
      as the process operates below titanium's vaporization threshold. This prevents
      the generation of hazardous metal fumes and respirable dust, ensuring no secondary
      air pollution from the base material.
