caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the titanium surface appears uneven with scattered
    dark contaminants, likely oxide particles and residues from processing. These
    clusters create rough patches and micro-pits, degrading smoothness. This condition,
    it shows, could weaken performance in aerospace or automotive uses, and calls
    for cleaning before laser treatment.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the titanium surface shows a smooth, contaminant-free
    finish with no visible residues. This restoration demonstrates high quality, fully
    preserving material integrity and microstructure. The metal's strength and corrosion
    resistance remain intact, and no defects like pitting appear. It supports durable
    performance in aerospace, automotive, and chemical processing applications.

  benefit: Chemical Waste Elimination
  description: Titanium laser cleaning eliminates chemical waste streams by removing
    surface contaminants through ablation, avoiding the hazardous etchants and solvents
    traditionally required for titanium surface preparation. This provides a dry,
    residue-free process ideal for high-purity applications in semiconductor, medical,
    and nuclear industries.
  quantifiedBenefits: Chemical waste elimination in Titanium laser cleaning reduces
    hazardous waste disposal by 100%, cuts operational costs by 15%, and increases
    processing throughput by 20%.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Water Usage Reduction
  description: Titanium's tenacious oxide layer is removed without the chemical dissolution
    or abrasive media blasting that typically generates large volumes of contaminated
    water waste. The laser process ablates contaminants directly, eliminating the
    need for water-based rinsing or slurry handling.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Energy Efficiency
  description: Titanium's low thermal conductivity confines laser energy to the surface
    contaminant layer, enabling its removal with minimal energy transfer into the
    substrate. This precise ablation process significantly reduces the total energy
    consumption compared to conventional thermal cleaning methods.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  description: Titanium laser cleaning eliminates airborne particulate matter by selectively
    ablating contaminants without vaporizing the underlying substrate, as the process
    operates below titanium's vaporization threshold. This prevents the generation
    of hazardous metal fumes and respirable dust, ensuring no secondary air pollution
    from the base material.
