      unit: rating
      research_basis: Granite is an igneous rock composed primarily of quartz and
        feldspar, making it highly resistant to chemical weathering and environmental
        corrosion. ASTM standards classify granite as having "excellent" weathering
        durability and chemical resistance, with minimal degradation from atmospheric
        exposure, acid rain, and temperature variations. Its low porosity and crystalline
        structure provide superior corrosion resistance compared to other natural
        stones.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: This authoritative geophysics reference provides typical flexural
        strength values for common rock types. For granite, it lists a range of 10-20
        MPa, with 15 MPa being a representative median value. This aligns with the
        material's known high compressive strength (200 MPa), as flexural strength
        is typically 1/10 to 1/15 of compressive strength for brittle rocks like granite.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Granite, as a silicate rock composed primarily of quartz and
        feldspars, does not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However, its
        primary limitation in air at high temperature is the α-β quartz phase transition
        at approximately 573°C. This transition involves a disruptive volume change
        and significant loss of mechanical strength, which is the critical failure
        mode considered for its maximum service temperature. NIST and other geological
        references cite 600°C as a practical upper limit for continuous service before
        this degradation becomes significant.

        typically falls between 0.5 and 1.5 MPa·√m, with most common values clustering
