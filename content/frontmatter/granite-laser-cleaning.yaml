        research_basis: Granite is an igneous rock composed primarily of quartz and
          feldspar, making it highly resistant to chemical weathering and environmental
          corrosion. ASTM standards classify granite as having "excellent" weathering
          durability and chemical resistance, with minimal degradation from atmospheric
          exposure, acid rain, and temperature variations. Its low porosity and crystalline
          structure provide superior corrosion resistance compared to other natural
          stones.

          of Rocks"
        research_basis: Granite, as a silicate rock composed primarily of quartz and
          feldspars, does not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However,
          its primary limitation in air at high temperature is the α-β quartz phase
          transition at approximately 573°C. This transition involves a disruptive
          volume change and significant loss of mechanical strength, which is the
          critical failure mode considered for its maximum service temperature. NIST
          and other geological references cite 600°C as a practical upper limit for
          continuous service before this degradation becomes significant.

        research_basis: This authoritative geophysics reference provides typical flexural
          strength values for common rock types. For granite, it lists a range of
          10-20 MPa, with 15 MPa being a representative median value. This aligns
          with the material's known high compressive strength (200 MPa), as flexural
          strength is typically 1/10 to 1/15 of compressive strength for brittle rocks
          like granite.
