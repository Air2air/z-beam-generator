  beforeText: Under microscopy, granite's contaminated surface reveals etched pits and micro-cracks from degradation, with
    contaminants as fine dust particles and oily residues clinging to pores. This buildup, typical in laser optics cleaning,
    dulls reflectivity and invites further erosion in high-precision applications.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the granite surface restores to a smooth, polished state, preserving its inherent strength and
    uniformity. This upholds integrity for stable optical tabletops in laser systems.

faq:
- question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) are most effective for cleaning biological growth like
    lichen and moss from granite without damaging the surface?
  answer: For granite, a 1064 nm wavelength at approximately 100 W average power is optimal. Use nanosecond pulses with a
    fluence around 2.5 J/cm² to effectively remove biological growth while preserving the mineral substrate. This method avoids
    the surface etching common with abrasive or chemical techniques.
- question: Can laser cleaning remove paint, graffiti, or cement residues from granite without causing discoloration or leaving
    a 'ghost' shadow?
  answer: Yes, laser cleaning effectively removes paint and cement from granite without ghosting when using proper parameters.
    At 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 50% beam overlap, we selectively ablate contaminants while preserving the mineral matrix. This
    prevents differential etching of feldspar and quartz, ensuring uniform results.
- question: How does the varying mineral composition (e.g., quartz, feldspar, mica) in different types of granite affect the
    laser cleaning process and its safety?
  answer: The varying mineral absorption in granite demands careful fluence control. Quartz's low thermal expansion risks
    micro-fracturing above 2.5 J/cm², while mica can vaporize, causing surface pitting. A 1064 nm wavelength at 100W helps
    manage these differential responses.
- question: What are the specific safety hazards when laser cleaning granite, such as the production of crystalline silica
    dust, and what protective equipment (PPE) is required?
  answer: Laser ablation of granite at 1064 nm generates hazardous crystalline silica dust. You must use a PAPR respirator
    and local exhaust ventilation, as the 2.5 J/cm² fluence required creates respirable LGACs that demand strict containment.
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for delicate historical granite monuments and statues, and what are the risks of altering
    the stone's patina or surface texture?
  answer: Laser cleaning can preserve historical granite when using low fluence below 2.5 J/cm². The non-abrasive nature protects
    surface morphology, but uncontrolled thermal impact risks altering the stone's prized patina. Meticulous testing on a
    small area is absolutely essential first.
- question: What is the typical operational cost and cleaning speed (e.g., m²/hour) for laser cleaning granite compared to
    traditional methods like sandblasting or chemical poultices?
  answer: Laser cleaning granite typically achieves 5-10 m²/hour using a 100 W system at 2.5 J/cm². While initial equipment
    costs are higher, this method eliminates abrasive and chemical disposal, offering superior cost-efficiency for large architectural
    facades over time.
- question: Does laser cleaning make the granite surface more susceptible to future soiling or water penetration by opening
    up the micro-topography?
  answer: Properly calibrated laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² removes contaminants without enlarging the granite's micro-topography.
    The process doesn't seal pores, so for exterior applications, applying a hydrophobic coating post-cleaning is recommended
    to prevent future water penetration and soiling.
- question: How do you validate the success of a laser cleaning process on granite? What metrics or tests are used to ensure
    cleanliness without damage?
  answer: We validate granite cleaning using microscopy and colorimetry to confirm contaminant removal while preserving the
    mineral matrix. The process must maintain surface integrity, verified through water absorption tests. Critical laser parameters
    like a 2.5 J/cm² fluence threshold and 100 µm spot size ensure efficacy without thermal damage.
