  beforeText: Under microscopy, granite's contaminated surface reveals etched pits
    and micro-cracks from degradation, with contaminants as fine dust particles and
    oily residues clinging to pores. This buildup, typical in laser optics cleaning,
    dulls reflectivity and invites further erosion in high-precision applications.
  afterText: Post-cleaning, the granite surface restores to a smooth, polished state,
    preserving its inherent strength and uniformity. This upholds integrity for stable
    optical tabletops in laser systems.

          durability and chemical resistance, with minimal degradation from atmospheric
          exposure, acid rain, and temperature variations. Its low porosity and crystalline
          structure provide superior corrosion resistance compared to other natural
          stones.

        research_basis: Granite, as a silicate rock composed primarily of quartz and
          feldspars, does not oxidize in the traditional metallic sense. However,
          its primary limitation in air at high temperature is the α-β quartz phase
          transition at approximately 573°C. This transition involves a disruptive
          volume change and significant loss of mechanical strength, which is the
          critical failure mode considered for its maximum service temperature. NIST
          and other geological references cite 600°C as a practical upper limit for
          continuous service before this degradation becomes significant.
