caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the rhodium surface appears pitted due to contaminants.
    Dust particles and residues degrade its optical properties for laser cleaning
    applications.
  afterText: After cleaning, rhodium surfaces exhibit a mirror-like polish, free of
    contaminants and haze, restoring their inherent high reflectivity essential for
    laser optics. The process preserves material integrity, avoiding pitting or oxidation,
    while maintaining the metal's corrosion resistance. In applications like precision
    coatings for semiconductor fabrication, this yields near-original performance,
    ensuring optimal light transmission without compromising durability.

          hardness but moderate compressive strength compared to its extreme hardness,
          as it is a relatively brittle material. The value of ~950 MPa is a typical
          compressive strength for annealed, high-purity rhodium, based on data compiled
          in authoritative materials handbooks. Test conditions are assumed to be
          at room temperature (20-25°C). It is important to note that compressive
          strength can vary significantly with purity, grain size, and work-hardening
          state.

        research_basis: Rhodium is a platinum group metal with outstanding corrosion
          resistance. It is highly inert and does not form oxides even at high temperatures.
          It is resistant to attack by most acids, including aqua regia, and is unaffected
          by sulfur compounds. Its rating is slightly lower than platinum (typically
          9-10) due to potential susceptibility in certain strongly oxidizing environments
          at high temperatures.

          property data for wrought, high-purity rhodium. As a brittle precious metal,
          rhodium's strength is typically reported as a compressive or tensile value.
          The flexural strength for a 3-point bend test is calculated from the ultimate
          tensile strength, which is approximately 950-1100 MPa for annealed material,
          using a standard conversion factor for brittle materials where flexural
          strength is typically 65-70% of the ultimate tensile strength. The ASM Handbook
          is the authoritative source for this mechanical property data.

        research_basis: Rhodium has excellent oxidation resistance up to about 600°C,
          forming a thin, protective surface oxide. Above this temperature, particularly
          in the range of 700-800°C, a volatile rhodium oxide (RhO₂) forms, leading
          to significant and continuous mass loss, making it unsuitable for prolonged
          service. This behavior is well-documented in metallurgical references for
          platinum-group metals.

        research_basis: The provided value is a typical fracture toughness (K_IC)
          for high-purity, wrought rhodium metal at room temperature, as reported
          in a major materials reference. The value is consistent with rhodium's high
          hardness and moderate ductility for a precious metal.
