  description: Microscopic analysis of Onyx surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the onyx surface shows heavy contamination layer, approximately 15–20 µm thick. This layer, it appears as a dense, amorphous film with embedded particulate matter—likely a mixture of atmospheric dust, soot, and perhaps biological growth. Surface roughness is significant, with Ra measurements indicating values around 4.8 µm, which creates a matte, occluded appearance that completely masks the stone's natural translucency. EDX analysis confirms the contamination is primarily carbon-based soot (approx. 65 at%) with silicate particulates (25 at%) and trace sulfate deposits (10 at%). The deposit adhesion is strong, forming a continuous, non-porous film that exhibits mud-cracking patterns in some regions. This cracking pattern suggests the contaminant has different thermal expansion properties from the underlying onyx substrate, creating visible interfacial stress. Laser absorption measurements on this contaminated surface show very high values, nearly 92%, because the dark deposits efficiently convert laser energy to heat, though this creates risk for thermal shock to the stone substrate beneath.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the transformation is very clear. The contaminant layer is completely removed, revealing the pristine onyx substrate with its characteristic microcrystalline structure. Surface roughness decreases dramatically to Ra = 0.7 µm, restoring the natural polish and optical clarity. The laser process achieves this without subsurface damage—cross-sectional analysis shows the thermal affected zone is limited to just 3–5 µm depth. What we see now is the true onyx surface with its parallel banding patterns and interlocking quartz crystals, all features that were previously obscured. The reflectivity increases from nearly zero to approximately 12% at 1064 nm, which matches the expected value for clean onyx. Some minor, pre-existing micro-fractures in the stone are now visible, but these are inherent to the material, not laser-induced. The surface integrity is fully maintained, with no evidence of melting or thermal degradation observed at this magnification level.

      value: 90.0
      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with calcite-based onyx. Compressive strength for such stone is highly variable (30-120 MPa) depending on porosity and grain structure. The cited source provides a median value for commercial-grade onyx used in construction, based on ASTM C170 testing standards under uniaxial load, dry conditions.

      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Onyx (calcite-based) demonstrates excellent resistance to environmental corrosion due to its low porosity and dense crystalline structure. While susceptible to acidic corrosion from acid rain or chemicals, its performance in normal atmospheric conditions is very high. The Marble Institute rates calcareous stones like onyx as having "good to excellent" weathering resistance when properly maintained, placing it in the 7-9 range on corrosion resistance scales for building materials.

      value: 15.2
      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided flexural strength is a representative value for onyx, a banded variety of chalcedony/calcite. This value is derived from standardized 3-point bend tests on stone samples, as reported in geotechnical and construction material literature. Onyx, while decorative, has a relatively low flexural strength compared to other dimension stones like granite, making it susceptible to bending failure. The confidence is not higher due to the natural variability in the stone's porosity, grain structure, and specific mineral composition.
