caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy of the contaminated Onyx surface shows a layer of fine dust
    particles and oily residues clinging to its pores. These contaminants, mostly
    mineral-based and unevenly distributed, cause subtle discoloration and block natural
    sheen. The stone exhibits early degradation with micro-pitting and faint scratches,
    and this affects its durability in everyday cleaning uses.
  afterText: This cleaned Onyx surface reveals a restored polish and even texture.
    It maintains strong material integrity, and the restoration quality supports long-term
    durability.

          environmental corrosion due to its low porosity and dense crystalline structure.
          While susceptible to acidic corrosion from acid rain or chemicals, its performance
          in normal atmospheric conditions is very high. The Marble Institute rates
          calcareous stones like onyx as having "good to excellent" weathering resistance
          when properly maintained, placing it in the 7-9 range on corrosion resistance
          scales for building materials.

          onyx, a banded variety of chalcedony/calcite. This value is derived from
          standardized 3-point bend tests on stone samples, as reported in geotechnical
          and construction material literature. Onyx, while decorative, has a relatively
          low flexural strength compared to other dimension stones like granite, making
          it susceptible to bending failure. The confidence is not higher due to the
          natural variability in the stone's porosity, grain structure, and specific
          mineral composition.
