    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Observing these results, I must say this cleaning reveals some intriguing
    patterns of surface oxidation, likely around 5-8 microns deep in the most affected
    areas. One cannot help but notice the inconsistent discoloration across the surface,
    which presents a genuine challenge for our Italian craftsmanship traditions where
    visual harmony is paramount. The contamination appears quite stubborn in these
    central zones, probably requiring careful adjustment of our laser parameters to
    achieve that beautiful clarity we expect. It becomes evident that this isn't merely
    about removal, but about preserving the material's inherent elegance beneath.
  afterText: Examining this beautiful surface transformation, the technical artistry
    achieved here is simply magnificent. The laser has restored the stainless steel
    to its original glory with what I find remarkable precision, leaving behind this
    exquisite detail and captivating transformation that speaks to both scientific
    and aesthetic excellence. This level of precision craftsmanship ensures the material
    will perform beautifully in our demanding Italian applications, from architectural
    elements to high-value manufacturing, where such visual perfection truly matters.

      value: 210.0
      min: 50
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of stainless steel is not a single
        fixed value and depends heavily on the specific alloy (e.g., 304, 316) and
        its temper condition. For the most common grade, AISI 304 annealed stainless
        steel, the compressive yield strength (the standard measure for compressive
        strength in metals) is approximately 210 MPa. This value is consistently reported
        across materials databases for this specific, widely-used condition. The provided
        material properties in the query are generic and do not specify an alloy,
        making this the most authoritative and probable value.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 1
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Stainless steel's chromium content (typically >10.5%) forms
        a passive oxide layer that provides excellent resistance to general atmospheric
        corrosion and many chemical environments. While specific ratings vary by grade
        (304, 316, etc.), stainless steel consistently ranks high in corrosion resistance
        compared to other metals, though not perfect in all environments (e.g., chloride
        exposure).

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 290.0
      min: 2.5
      max: 1050.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of stainless steel is not a single fixed
        value and depends heavily on the specific alloy (e.g., 304, 316) and its temper
        condition. For common austenitic grades like 304 in the annealed condition,
        the yield strength (which is closely related to and often used as a conservative
        estimate for flexural strength in ductile metals) is typically in the range
        of 215-290 MPa. The provided value of 290 MPa is a representative upper value
        for the yield strength of annealed 304 stainless steel, which is a standard
        reference point for bending strength in the absence of a specific alloy designation.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 925.0
      min: 200
      max: 1200
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The oxidation resistance of stainless steel is highly dependent
        on its specific grade. For common austenitic grades (e.g., 304, 316), the
        maximum continuous service temperature in air is typically 870-925°C. The
        925°C value represents the upper limit for intermittent service for many grades,
        while continuous service is often limited to 815-870°C. The chromium content
        (typically 17-20% in austenitic steels) forms a protective oxide scale, but
        breakdown occurs rapidly above this range, leading to significant oxidation.

      max: 200
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Stainless steel fracture toughness varies significantly by specific
        alloy and heat treatment. Austenitic grades (e.g., 304, 316) typically range
        75-200 MPa·√m, while martensitic grades are lower (25-75 MPa·√m). The provided
        material properties don't specify the stainless steel type, requiring a broad
        range covering common structural stainless steels.
