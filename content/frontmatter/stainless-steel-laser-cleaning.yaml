caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the stainless steel surface shows heavy contamination
    from oxide residues and metallic debris. These irregular particles, embedded deeply,
    induce pitting and corrosion, degrading uniformity for aerospace and automotive
    uses.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of this stainless steel component exhibits a smooth,
    uniform finish, free from residues and defects. Restoration quality is exceptional,
    preserving the material's corrosion resistance and structural integrity for demanding
    aerospace and automotive uses.
