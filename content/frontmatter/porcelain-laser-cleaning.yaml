caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the porcelain surface appears very-very rough and contaminated heavily. Fine particles scatter
    and cluster, forming irregular layers that obscure the original smooth glaze. Contaminants show as dark, amorphous deposits—mostly
    organic residues and mineral dusts—that adhere tightly, causing discoloration. Surface degradation is evident in micro-cracks
    and pitting, where etching weakens the ceramic structure, so porosity increases then invites further soiling.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the porcelain surface appears very-very smooth and glossy, restoring its original
    clean-clean condition so well. The process removes contaminants then preserves the ceramic's fine texture, and material
    integrity stays intact without cracks or alterations. Restoration quality is excellent for general applications.

faq:
- question: What laser settings (wavelength, power, pulse duration) are safe and effective for cleaning soot, grime, or biological
    growth from historical porcelain without damaging the glaze?
  answer: For historical porcelain, employ a 1064 nm wavelength with fluence below 2.5 J/cm² and nanosecond pulses. This effectively
    ablates contaminants like soot while preserving the delicate glaze. Always validate these parameters on a hidden area
    first to preclude any micro-cracking or gloss alteration.
- question: Can a laser safely remove metal staining (like rust or bronze drips) from a porcelain surface without etching
    or discoloring it?
  answer: With optimal 2.5 J/cm² fluence and 100 µm spot size, a 1064 nm laser can selectively ablate metal staining from
    porcelain. The glaze's high thermal shock resistance allows contaminants to be removed via rapid vaporization, avoiding
    substrate etching that chemical poultices risk through prolonged contact.
- question: How does the high reflectivity of a glazed porcelain surface affect the laser cleaning process and operator safety?
  answer: Glazed porcelain's high reflectivity at 1064 nm creates significant stray radiation risks. Operators must use wavelength-specific
    laser safety glasses, as the 2.5 J/cm² fluence needed for contaminant removal is largely reflected, not absorbed, by the
    substrate.
- question: Is laser cleaning suitable for porcelain with existing hairline cracks (crazing), or does it risk worsening the
    damage?
  answer: Laser cleaning on crazed porcelain risks thermal stress propagation at fluences above 2.5 J/cm², potentially fusing
    contaminants within micro-fractures. For such delicate pieces, I recommend alternative non-thermal methods to avoid exacerbating
    existing hairline cracks.
- question: What is the risk of 'over-cleaning' or ablating the actual porcelain glaze when trying to remove a tenacious contaminant?
  answer: Over-cleaning risks glaze ablation if fluence exceeds ~2.5 J/cm². Monitor for a high-pitched acoustic shift and
    irreversible surface matting, indicating damage. The 1064 nm wavelength helps maintain this delicate threshold between
    contaminant removal and preserving the substrate.
- question: After laser cleaning porcelain, is any post-treatment or protective coating required to stabilize the surface?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² with nanosecond pulses typically leaves a stable, non-invasive surface on porcelain.
    For archaeological pieces exposed to weathering, a silica-based consolidant may be applied to ensure long-term stability
    of the cleaned glaze.
- question: For industrial porcelain (e.g., electrical insulators), can laser cleaning restore dielectric strength by removing
    all conductive pollution, and how is effectiveness verified?
  answer: Laser cleaning at 2.5 J/cm² effectively strips conductive salt layers from porcelain, restoring dielectric integrity.
    Verification is achieved through leakage current measurements and hydrophobicity tests, offering a non-abrasive alternative
    to traditional sandblasting that preserves the substrate.
- question: How do the different compositions of hard-paste vs. soft-paste porcelain affect the laser cleaning strategy and
    risk assessment?
  answer: Hard-paste porcelain's superior thermal stability allows for higher fluence up to 2.5 J/cm². In contrast, soft-paste's
    lower vitrification point and higher thermal expansion necessitate a more cautious approach with reduced power and meticulous
    thermal control to prevent glaze damage and micro-fracturing. Material identification is therefore a critical first step.
- question: What are the key advantages of using a laser over chemical or mechanical (abrasive) methods for cleaning delicate
    porcelain artifacts?
  answer: Laser cleaning excels for porcelain due to its non-contact precision, vital for intricate relief work. With a fluence
    of 2.5 J/cm² and a 100 µm spot, we selectively ablate contaminants without mechanical abrasion or chemical residues. This
    ensures the delicate ceramic substrate remains completely undamaged, preserving its structural and aesthetic integrity.
