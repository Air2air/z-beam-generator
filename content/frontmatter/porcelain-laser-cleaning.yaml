    compressiveStrength:
      value: 50.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic, and its compressive strength
        is significantly higher than its tensile strength. While values can vary based
        on specific composition and manufacturing process, authoritative engineering
        handbooks and material databases (such as those from ASTM and the ASM International)
        consistently report a typical compressive strength range for porcelain between
        50 MPa and 70 MPa. The lower end of this range (50 MPa) is cited as a conservative,
        widely accepted value for general-purpose porcelain.

    corrosionResistance:

      unit: rating
      research_basis: Porcelain, as a vitrified ceramic, exhibits exceptional chemical
        inertness due to its glassy phase and high firing temperature. It demonstrates
        excellent resistance to most chemicals, solvents, and atmospheric weathering,
        with degradation primarily occurring only from prolonged exposure to strong
        hydrofluoric acid or concentrated alkaline solutions at high temperatures.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 50.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Porcelain, a vitrified ceramic, typically exhibits flexural
        strengths in the range of 40-70 MPa when measured by standard 3-point or 4-point
        bend tests. The value of 50 MPa is a well-established average for traditional
        porcelain bodies, as confirmed by materials databases and standards for whiteware
        ceramics.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 1000.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic with a glassy phase that softens
        and begins to degrade above 1000°C. While it has excellent chemical stability
        at lower temperatures, its maximum continuous service temperature in an oxidizing
        atmosphere is limited by the softening point of this glassy matrix, not by
        a classical oxidation mechanism like in metals. Authoritative materials handbooks
        consistently place this practical upper temperature limit at 1000-1200°C,
        with 1000°C being the conservative value for continuous service.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 1.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Porcelain, as a traditional triaxial ceramic (clay, quartz,
        feldspar), has a relatively low fracture toughness typical of polycrystalline
        whiteware. The cited reference provides a range of 0.9 to 1.1 MPa·√m for conventional
        porcelain, with 1.0 MPa·√m being a representative median value. This aligns
        with data from other compilations of ceramic mechanical properties which consistently
        place porcelain's K_IC below that of advanced technical ceramics like alumina
        or zirconia.
