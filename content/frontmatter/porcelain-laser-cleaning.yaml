caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the porcelain surface appears very-very rough and
    contaminated heavily. Fine particles scatter and cluster, forming irregular layers
    that obscure the original smooth glaze. Contaminants show as dark, amorphous deposits—mostly
    organic residues and mineral dusts—that adhere tightly, causing discoloration.
    Surface degradation is evident in micro-cracks and pitting, where etching weakens
    the ceramic structure, so porosity increases then invites further soiling.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the porcelain surface appears very-very
    smooth and glossy, restoring its original clean-clean condition so well. The process
    removes contaminants then preserves the ceramic's fine texture, and material integrity
    stays intact without cracks or alterations. Restoration quality is excellent for
    general applications.

        research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic, and its compressive strength
          is significantly higher than its tensile strength. While values can vary
          based on specific composition and manufacturing process, authoritative engineering
          handbooks and material databases (such as those from ASTM and the ASM International)
          consistently report a typical compressive strength range for porcelain between
          50 MPa and 70 MPa. The lower end of this range (50 MPa) is cited as a conservative,
          widely accepted value for general-purpose porcelain.

          inertness due to its glassy phase and high firing temperature. It demonstrates
          excellent resistance to most chemicals, solvents, and atmospheric weathering,
          with degradation primarily occurring only from prolonged exposure to strong
          hydrofluoric acid or concentrated alkaline solutions at high temperatures.

        research_basis: Porcelain is a vitrified ceramic with a glassy phase that
          softens and begins to degrade above 1000°C. While it has excellent chemical
          stability at lower temperatures, its maximum continuous service temperature
          in an oxidizing atmosphere is limited by the softening point of this glassy
          matrix, not by a classical oxidation mechanism like in metals. Authoritative
          materials handbooks consistently place this practical upper temperature
          limit at 1000-1200°C, with 1000°C being the conservative value for continuous
          service.

        research_basis: Porcelain, as a traditional triaxial ceramic (clay, quartz,
          feldspar), has a relatively low fracture toughness typical of polycrystalline
          whiteware. The cited reference provides a range of 0.9 to 1.1 MPa·√m for
          conventional porcelain, with 1.0 MPa·√m being a representative median value.
          This aligns with data from other compilations of ceramic mechanical properties
          which consistently place porcelain's K_IC below that of advanced technical
          ceramics like alumina or zirconia.
