caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy shows the walnut surface contaminated with fine dust particles
    and oily residues. This layer causes discoloration and minor fiber erosion. The
    wood appears roughened and weakened.
  afterText: The cleaned walnut surface appears smooth and uniform, with its rich
    natural grain fully visible and free from dirt or old finishes. This treatment
    restores the wood's original beauty effectively, and it preserves structural integrity
    without causing cracks or discoloration. For applications in aerospace, automotive,
    and cultural heritage, the material remains strong and aesthetically pleasing,
    ensuring long-term durability.
