    compressiveStrength:
      value: 52.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property data for North American hardwoods, listing the compressive strength (crushing strength) parallel to grain for Black Walnut as 52.1 MPa. This value is consistent with published wood engineering references and represents the standard test condition of compression parallel to grain at 12% moisture content.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Walnut is classified as having moderate to low natural decay resistance among hardwoods. While more durable than many domestic species, it's not considered highly resistant to fungal decay or insect attack without treatment. The Wood Database rates black walnut's decay resistance as "durable" but notes it's not suitable for ground contact without preservative treatment, placing it in the lower-middle range of wood durability scales.
    density:
      value: 0.64

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 101.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority for wood properties, reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Black Walnut (Juglans nigra) as 101 MPa, derived from standardized 3-point and 4-point bend tests (ASTM D143). This value is consistent with published data for this hardwood species.
    hardness:
      value: 4.9
      min: 1
      max: 5000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material (USDA Forest Service, FPL-GTR-190) and ASTM D143-14 Standard Test Methods for Small Clear Specimens of Timber'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The provided material properties (specific heat, density) are consistent with wood. Authoritative sources like the USDA Wood Handbook indicate that significant thermal degradation of wood, including oxidation and pyrolysis, begins well below 200°C. For most wood species, prolonged exposure to temperatures above 150°C in air leads to significant chemical changes, charring, and loss of mechanical strength. Walnut, as a hardwood, falls within this general range. The value is a conservative estimate for the onset of significant oxidative degradation in an air environment.
    porosity:
      value: 0.56

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.67
      min: 0.33
      max: 4.4
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: This value is derived from standardized fracture toughness (K_IC) testing of clear, straight-grained walnut wood in the radial-longitudinal orientation at room temperature. The study provides a range of 0.60-0.74 MPa·√m for walnut, with 0.67 MPa·√m representing a typical mean value for this hardwood species.
