caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy reveals the polycarbonate surface contaminated with fine
    dust particles and oily residues. This surface, it shows light degradation through
    micro-scratches and hazy patches, reducing smoothness and optical clarity.
  afterText: After cleaning the polycarbonate surface, it regains its smooth, glossy
    finish without any visible residues. This plastic material shows restored clarity
    and even texture, free from haze or spots. The process preserves integrity, with
    no thermal stress or micro-cracks that could weaken its impact resistance. Restoration
    quality proves reliable, maintaining optical properties and durability for everyday
    uses like protective covers and displays.

        ai_verified: true

        research_basis: Polycarbonate's compressive strength is consistently reported
          in the 75-85 MPa range by material data sheets from manufacturers like Covestro
          (Makrolon) and SABIC (LEXAN). The value of 80 MPa is a standard reference
          point for general-purpose polycarbonate under standard test conditions (room
          temperature, 23°C). The provided hardness (85.0 MPa) is a related mechanical
          property that supports this compressive strength value, as they often correlate
          for rigid plastics.

        research_basis: Polycarbonate exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range
          of chemicals, including dilute acids, alcohols, and oils, contributing to
          a high corrosion resistance rating for a plastic. Its primary vulnerabilities
          are to strong bases, certain hydrocarbons, and UV radiation, which slightly
          reduce its score from a perfect 10. This assessment is based on standardized
          chemical resistance data for engineering plastics.

        research_basis: According to MatWeb, a widely recognized database of material
          properties, the continuous service temperature for polycarbonate in air
          is typically 115-130°C. The value of 125°C represents a conservative midpoint
          of this range, as polycarbonate begins to undergo significant thermal degradation
          and oxidation above this temperature, leading to loss of mechanical properties
          and discoloration.
