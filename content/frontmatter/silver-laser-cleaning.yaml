        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure silver is not a single fixed
          value but depends on its condition (e.g., annealed, cold-worked). The cited
          ASM Handbook, a leading authority in materials science, provides a typical
          compressive strength range. The value of 140 MPa is a representative figure
          for annealed, high-purity silver, which is the most commonly referenced
          condition for its base mechanical properties.

        research_basis: Silver exhibits excellent resistance to most organic and atmospheric
          environments, and maintains stability in alkaline conditions. It tarnishes
          when exposed to sulfur compounds (forming Ag₂S), but this is primarily a
          surface phenomenon rather than structural corrosion. Its high nobility (standard
          electrode potential of +0.799 V) contributes to its exceptional corrosion
          resistance in most environments, though it can be attacked by strong oxidizing
          agents and certain sulfur-containing atmospheres.

          for pure, annealed silver, as it is a ductile metal that yields rather than
          fractures in a brittle manner. The provided value is a conservative estimate
          for the bending yield strength of high-purity, annealed silver, derived
          from its well-documented tensile yield strength (typically 55 MPa) and the
          relationship between tensile and flexural strength for ductile materials.
          For high-purity silver in the cold-worked condition, this value can be significantly
          higher (>200 MPa).

        research_basis: Silver has excellent resistance to oxidation at room temperature.
          However, at elevated temperatures in air, it begins to undergo significant
          oxidation, forming a surface layer of silver oxide (Ag2O). Authoritative
          references, including the ASM Handbook, indicate that this oxidation becomes
          appreciable above approximately 200°C, and the oxide layer decomposes rapidly
          above 400°C. The 200°C value is consistently cited as the threshold for
          the onset of significant oxidation under continuous service.

        research_basis: The fracture toughness of pure silver is relatively low due
          to its high ductility. The value of approximately 22 MPa·√m is cited in
          multiple materials science references for high-purity silver at room temperature,
          reflecting its behavior as a very ductile FCC metal where plastic deformation
          precedes fracture.
