  description: Microscopic analysis of Terbium surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the terbium surface appears very-very rough and pitted,
    showing heavy contamination from dust particles and oxide layers. These contaminants
    cling tightly, forming irregular clusters that block the smooth rare-earth texture.
    Surface degradation is evident in cracked areas and faded luster, so the material
    looks weakened for electronics or medical uses. Then, cleaning becomes necessary
    to restore its properties.
  afterText: The cleaned Terbium surface appears very-very smooth and clean. Restoration
    quality is high, so material integrity remains intact for electronics and medical
    applications.
