caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the terbium surface appears very-very rough and pitted,
    showing heavy contamination from dust particles and oxide layers. These contaminants
    cling tightly, forming irregular clusters that block the smooth rare-earth texture.
    Surface degradation is evident in cracked areas and faded luster, so the material
    looks weakened for electronics or medical uses. Then, cleaning becomes necessary
    to restore its properties.
  afterText: The cleaned Terbium surface appears very-very smooth and clean. Restoration
    quality is high, so material integrity remains intact for electronics and medical
    applications.

  benefit: Chemical Waste Elimination
  description: Terbium laser cleaning achieves chemical waste elimination by utilizing
    the material's specific absorption properties for high-efficiency contaminant
    removal, preventing the generation of hazardous solvent and acid waste streams
    common in semiconductor, electronics, and nuclear decontamination processes.
  quantifiedBenefits: Terbium laser cleaning eliminates 100% of chemical waste, reduces
    operational costs by 30%, and cuts cleaning cycle times by 50%.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Water Usage Reduction
  description: Terbium laser cleaning achieves water usage reduction by utilizing
    high-purity photons for contaminant removal, eliminating the need for the aqueous
    solutions and rinsing cycles typically required in chemical or abrasive processes
    for rare-earth materials. This dry, non-contact method prevents the generation
    of contaminated wastewater streams associated with traditional wet cleaning.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Energy Efficiency
  description: Terbium laser cleaning achieves energy efficiency by utilizing the
    material's specific electronic energy levels, which enable high absorption of
    the laser wavelength. This resonant energy transfer allows for effective contaminant
    removal with minimal pulse energy and a high repetition rate, reducing overall
    power consumption compared to broadband ablation processes.
- applicableIndustries: []
  benefit: Air Quality Improvement
  description: Terbium laser cleaning eliminates airborne contaminants by selectively
    ablating surface oxides and particulates without generating secondary waste, as
    the rare-earth element's specific absorption properties enable precise, non-contact
    removal. This process avoids the production of hazardous respirable fumes or dust
    associated with traditional abrasive methods, directly improving local air quality.
