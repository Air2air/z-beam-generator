  description: Microscopic analysis of Ash surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Microscopy shows ash wood's contaminated surface with dirt-clogged pores
    and uneven texture. Contaminants include fine dust and organic residues. Degradation
    features micro-cracks, hindering cleaning in optical laser applications.
  afterText: After cleaning ash wood surfaces, the material exhibits a restored smoothness
    and vibrant grain, free from residues that dull its appearance. This process upholds
    the wood's structural integrity, preventing fiber damage or discoloration. In
    furniture refinishing applications, such restoration ensures long-term durability
    and aesthetic appeal for everyday use.
