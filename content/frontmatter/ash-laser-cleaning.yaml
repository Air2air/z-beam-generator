    compressiveStrength:
      value: 51.0
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database compiles standardized test data from the USDA
        Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory and other authoritative sources.
        For white ash (Fraxinus americana), the compressive strength parallel to grain
        is consistently reported as 51 MPa at 12% moisture content, which is the standard
        condition for wood mechanical testing. This value aligns with the known high
        strength-to-weight ratio of ash among hardwoods.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Ash wood has moderate to low natural durability against decay
        fungi and insects. It's not resistant to moisture, rot, or environmental degradation
        without preservative treatment. While it has good mechanical properties, its
        heartwood is perishable and has limited resistance to wood-destroying organisms,
        placing it in the low durability category for corrosion/decay resistance.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 103.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally
        recognized authority on wood properties. For the "White Ash" group, it lists
        a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 14,900 lbf/in², which converts to 103 MPa. This
        value is derived from standardized 3-point and 4-point bend tests on small,
        clear, straight-grained specimens.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 150.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for wood is not a standard
        metric as it is for metals. For wood, the relevant property is the temperature
        at which significant thermal degradation begins. Authoritative sources like
        the USDA Wood Handbook indicate that prolonged exposure to temperatures above
        150°C leads to significant pyrolysis, charring, and oxidative degradation
        for most wood species, including hardwoods like Ash. This temperature represents
        the maximum for continuous service before chemical decomposition accelerates.

        K_IC) of various hardwood species, including White Ash. The reported values
        for Ash fall within a range, with 3.5 MPa·√m being a representative mean value
        for clear, straight-grained material tested in the radial-longitudinal orientation
        at room temperature.
