caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the bronze surface shows a heavily contaminated
    condition, with fine dust particles and greenish oxide deposits clinging tightly.
    This surface, it reveals pitting from corrosion, and uneven degradation that dulls
    the metal's natural sheen, signaling material wear.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the bronze surface regains its smooth texture and
    warm golden tone, free from dirt and oxidation. This restoration preserves the
    material's integrity, with no pitting or discoloration. It demonstrates even coverage,
    enhancing durability for everyday use and display.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of bronze is not a single fixed value
          but varies significantly with the specific alloy composition (e.g., tin
          content, presence of aluminum, lead, or phosphorus) and its temper (e.g.,
          cast, annealed, or hard). For common cast tin bronzes (e.g., UNS C90500),
          the compressive yield strength (0.2% offset) typically ranges from 125 MPa
          (annealed) to over 550 MPa (hard). The value of 250 MPa is a representative,
          conservative estimate for a medium-strength, commonly used bronze alloy
          in an "as-cast" or annealed condition. The provided material properties
          (density, hardness) are consistent with this class of alloys.

          The cited value of 310 MPa is a representative mid-range figure for a medium-strength
          bronze alloy like C83600 (leaded red brass) or C90500 (tin bronze) in a
          sand-cast or extruded condition, based on standardized 3-point bend test

        research_basis: The oxidation resistance temperature for bronze is not a single
          fixed point but a range. For continuous service in air, a conservative maximum
          is typically 260°C (500°F) for many standard tin bronzes. While brief exposure
          to higher temperatures is possible, significant oxidation begins above this
          temperature, leading to the formation of non-protective oxide scales (primarily
          CuO and SnO2). This value is a general guideline for common bronze alloys;
          specific compositions (e.g., aluminum bronzes) can have significantly higher
          resistance.
