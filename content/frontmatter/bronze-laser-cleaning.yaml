  description: Bronze's high thermal conductivity (75 W/(m·K)) enables efficient energy
    transfer during laser ablation, minimizing the heat-affected zone and preventing
    the release of hazardous metal fumes. This precise, non-contact process eliminates
    the need for chemical solvents or abrasive media, reducing airborne particulate
    matter and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.

outcomeMetrics:
- metric: Contaminant Removal Efficiency
  description: Contaminant Removal Efficiency quantifies the mass ablation of surface
    oxides and sulfides from the bronze substrate, measured via mass spectrometry
    to distinguish target contaminants from the base alloy. The metric accounts for
    the material's low hardness (75 HB) and initial roughness (1.2 µm Ra) to prevent
    unacceptable base metal removal.
  measurementMethods:
  - Before/after microscopy
  - Chemical analysis
  - Mass spectrometry
  factorsAffecting:
  - Contamination type
  - Adhesion strength
  - Surface geometry
  units: []
  typicalRanges: 95-99.9% depending on application and material
- metric: Processing Speed
  description: Processing Speed for Bronze laser cleaning is measured in area per
    unit time (e.g., cm²/min), quantifying the rate at which surface contaminants
    or oxides are removed from the bronze substrate without inducing metallurgical
    damage, such as micro-cracking or localized melting, which is a risk given its
    moderate Brinell hardness of 75 HB and initial surface roughness of 1.2 µm Ra.

  units:
  - m²/h
  - cm²/min
  - mm²/s
- metric: Surface Quality Preservation
  description: Surface Quality Preservation quantifies the change in surface roughness
    (ΔRa) of the bronze substrate, ensuring the final post-cleaning roughness remains
    at or below the initial as-cast baseline of 1.2 μm Ra without inducing surface
    melting or a measurable alteration to the bulk hardness of 75 HB.

  units: []
- metric: Thermal Damage Avoidance
  description: Thermal Damage Avoidance quantifies the successful removal of surface
    contaminants from bronze without exceeding its tempering threshold, thereby preventing
    a measurable reduction in Brinell hardness below 75 HB. This is confirmed by post-process
    hardness testing and the absence of surface oxidation or melting, which would
    alter the initial 1.2 μm Ra roughness profile.
