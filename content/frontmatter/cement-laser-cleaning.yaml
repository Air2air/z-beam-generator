      value: 7.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Cement provides excellent protection against general environmental
        corrosion when properly formulated into concrete, creating a highly alkaline
        environment (pH ~13) that passivates steel reinforcement. The compressive
        strength of 42.5 MPa indicates a quality cement capable of producing dense,
        low-permeability concrete that resists chloride ingress and carbonation. While
        cement paste itself can deteriorate in aggressive chemical environments, its
        general corrosion resistance in typical atmospheric conditions is rated as
        good to very good.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 6.5
      min: 2
      max: 20
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: For cement-based materials like concrete, flexural strength
        (modulus of rupture) is typically 10-15% of compressive strength. For a 42.5
        MPa cement (consistent with CEM I 42.5N classification), the expected flexural
        strength range is 4-7 MPa. The 6.5 MPa value represents a typical mean value
        for this compressive strength class, derived from the well-established empirical
        relationship in concrete technology. The 4-point bend test (third-point loading)
        per ASTM C78 is the standard method for this measurement.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 300.0
      min: 300.0
      max: 1200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Cement (Portland cement) is a hydraulic binder, not a metal,
        so "oxidation resistance" is not a standard property. The provided value is
        the maximum continuous service temperature for structural concrete before
        significant dehydration and strength loss begin. At temperatures above 300-400°C,
        the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) dehydrate, portlandite (Ca(OH)₂) decomposes,
        and the material's integrity is compromised, analogous to "failure" for this
        context.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.3
      min: 0.15
      max: 1.1
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness of cement paste (as opposed to concrete)
        is well-documented in cement science literature. For ordinary Portland cement
        pastes with compressive strengths in the 40-50 MPa range, typical Mode I fracture
        toughness (K_IC) values range from 0.2 to 0.4 MPa·√m. The cited source provides
        experimental data and theoretical models showing values clustering around
        0.3 MPa·√m for this material class, which aligns with the known compressive
        strength provided.
