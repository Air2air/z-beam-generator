caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the cement surface reveals a rugged terrain marred
    by contaminants. Fine particles of silica dust and organic residues cling to pores,
    forming irregular clusters that obscure the matrix. This contamination accelerates
    degradation, evident in microcracks and pitting, where hydration products erode,
    weakening the masonry's integrity over time.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the cement surface appears remarkably restored,
    free from ingrained dirt and efflorescence that marred its original texture. This
    precision, it reveals the masonry's subtle grain without abrasion, ensuring structural
    integrity remains uncompromised. The restoration quality excels, blending seamlessly
    with adjacent areas for a uniform, durable finish suitable for heritage or modern
    applications.

          corrosion when properly formulated into concrete, creating a highly alkaline
          environment (pH ~13) that passivates steel reinforcement. The compressive
          strength of 42.5 MPa indicates a quality cement capable of producing dense,
          low-permeability concrete that resists chloride ingress and carbonation.
          While cement paste itself can deteriorate in aggressive chemical environments,
          its general corrosion resistance in typical atmospheric conditions is rated
          as good to very good.

        research_basis: For cement-based materials like concrete, flexural strength
          (modulus of rupture) is typically 10-15% of compressive strength. For a
          42.5 MPa cement (consistent with CEM I 42.5N classification), the expected
          flexural strength range is 4-7 MPa. The 6.5 MPa value represents a typical
          mean value for this compressive strength class, derived from the well-established
          empirical relationship in concrete technology. The 4-point bend test (third-point
          loading) per ASTM C78 is the standard method for this measurement.

        research_basis: Cement (Portland cement) is a hydraulic binder, not a metal,
          so "oxidation resistance" is not a standard property. The provided value
          is the maximum continuous service temperature for structural concrete before
          significant dehydration and strength loss begin. At temperatures above 300-400°C,
          the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) dehydrate, portlandite (Ca(OH)₂) decomposes,
          and the material's integrity is compromised, analogous to "failure" for
          this context.
