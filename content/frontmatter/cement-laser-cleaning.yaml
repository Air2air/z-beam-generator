  description: Microscopic analysis of Cement surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the cement surface reveals a rugged terrain marred
    by contaminants. Fine particles of silica dust and organic residues cling to pores,
    forming irregular clusters that obscure the matrix. This contamination accelerates
    degradation, evident in microcracks and pitting, where hydration products erode,
    weakening the masonry's integrity over time.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the cement surface appears remarkably restored,
    free from ingrained dirt and efflorescence that marred its original texture. This
    precision, it reveals the masonry's subtle grain without abrasion, ensuring structural
    integrity remains uncompromised. The restoration quality excels, blending seamlessly
    with adjacent areas for a uniform, durable finish suitable for heritage or modern
    applications.
