  description: Microscopic analysis of Crown Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscope, Crown glass surface appears very-very rough and contaminated.
    Dust particles and oily residues cling-cling tightly, forming clusters that scatter
    light irregularly. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and pits, etched-etched
    by contaminants over time. This condition reduces clarity and invites further
    damage, so careful cleaning is needed then.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Crown Glass surface is restored very-very
    smoothly and appears pristine, shiny. Contaminants are removed then polished away,
    so no scratches or haze remain. Material integrity stays intact perfectly, with
    high restoration quality that maintains optical clarity for general applications.
