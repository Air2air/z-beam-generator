caption:
  beforeText: Under microscope, Crown glass surface appears very-very rough and contaminated.
    Dust particles and oily residues cling-cling tightly, forming clusters that scatter
    light irregularly. Surface degradation shows as micro-cracks and pits, etched-etched
    by contaminants over time. This condition reduces clarity and invites further
    damage, so careful cleaning is needed then.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the Crown Glass surface is restored very-very
    smoothly and appears pristine, shiny. Contaminants are removed then polished away,
    so no scratches or haze remain. Material integrity stays intact perfectly, with
    high restoration quality that maintains optical clarity for general applications.

        research_basis: Crown glass, as a common soda-lime silicate glass, has a well-documented
          compressive strength that is significantly higher than its tensile strength.
          Authoritative engineering handbooks consistently report a compressive strength
          range of 500-2000 MPa for annealed soda-lime glass, with a typical or mean
          value around 1000-1100 MPa. The cited source provides a specific value within
          this established range for generic crown/soda-lime glass.

          It maintains stability against water, atmospheric conditions, and most acids,
          with corrosion rates typically <0.1 µm/year in neutral pH environments.
          The 8/10 rating reflects minor vulnerability to alkaline solutions and stress
          corrosion cracking.

          average for pristine, laboratory-tested specimens under short-term loading
          in a 3- or 4-point bend test. This strength is highly dependent on surface
          quality and test conditions, as flaws dramatically reduce the practical
          strength.

          in the traditional sense but softens and deforms. Its maximum continuous

          for this glass type in authoritative materials references.
