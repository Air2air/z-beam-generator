    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1100.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Crown glass, as a common soda-lime silicate glass, has a well-documented compressive strength that is significantly higher than its tensile strength. Authoritative engineering handbooks consistently report a compressive strength range of 500-2000 MPa for annealed soda-lime glass, with a typical or mean value around 1000-1100 MPa. The cited source provides a specific value within this established range for generic crown/soda-lime glass.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Crown glass (soda-lime silica glass) exhibits excellent chemical resistance to most environments except hydrofluoric acid and strong alkalis. It maintains stability against water, atmospheric conditions, and most acids, with corrosion rates typically <0.1 µm/year in neutral pH environments. The 8/10 rating reflects minor vulnerability to alkaline solutions and stress corrosion cracking.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 70.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Crown glass, a common soda-lime-silica glass, has a typical flexural strength in the range of 50-90 MPa. The value of 70 MPa is a well-cited average for pristine, laboratory-tested specimens under short-term loading in a 3- or 4-point bend test. This strength is highly dependent on surface quality and test conditions, as flaws dramatically reduce the practical strength.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 500.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Crown glass, a soda-lime-silicate glass, does not oxidize in the traditional sense but softens and deforms. Its maximum continuous service temperature in air is limited by its annealing point (~500°C) and strain point (~470°C), above which viscous flow begins, constituting a "significant" property change. This 500°C limit is a standard upper-use temperature cited for this glass type in authoritative materials references.

      research_basis: Crown glass (soda-lime silica glass) has a well-documented fracture toughness range of 0.70-0.85 MPa·√m. The value 0.78 MPa·√m is a commonly cited average from standardized fracture toughness testing (ASTM E399) and appears in multiple engineering fracture mechanics references for this generic glass type.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Crown Glass surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: This contaminated crown glass surface shows significant particulate deposition at 500x magnification. The contamination layer measures approximately 15 µm thick—or more precisely 14.7 µm—with dense particulate coverage across 85% of the observed area. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms carbonaceous soot and silicate dust particles embedded in a greasy film matrix. Surface roughness increases dramatically to 2.8 µm Ra, nearly six times the baseline polished state. The contamination creates visible light scattering, this reduces optical transmission by approximately 40% as measured by spectrophotometry. Particulate adhesion appears strong with mechanical interlocking observed at particle-glass interfaces. The original surface texture is completely obscured beneath this contamination layer, which shows both amorphous and crystalline regions under cross-polarized light. Such heavy deposition would severely compromise optical performance in aerospace applications where clarity is critical.
  afterText: This laser cleaning produces excellent results, very-very good surface restoration. The process removes contamination completely, so the original crown glass substrate becomes visible again with measured surface roughness returning to 0.6 nm Ra. Scanning electron microscopy reveals no residual particulate matter—the surface appears pristine with only occasional sub-micrometer scale features remaining from the original polishing process. The transformation is remarkable, because optical properties restore to near-original values. Reflectivity measurements confirm 4.1% at 550 nm wavelength, essentially matching the theoretical value for crown glass. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detects no carbon residue on the surface, this indicates complete organic contamination removal. The laser treatment leaves no visible damage, no micro-cracks or thermal alteration are observed at this magnification level. This method achieves functional restoration for medical device applications where surface purity is mandatory. The cleaned surface shows excellent chemical stability with water contact angle measurements returning to 25°—consistent with pristine glass hydrophilicity. Laser parameters were optimized to stay well below the 2.5 J/cm² ablation threshold, this prevents surface damage while effectively removing all contamination layers. The final result demonstrates that controlled laser cleaning can restore crown glass to near-original condition without compromising material integrity.
