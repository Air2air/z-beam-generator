  description: Microscopic analysis of Tungsten Carbide surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the tungsten carbide surface appears very-very rough
    and contaminated heavily. Contaminants, like oily residues and metal particles
    from machining, cover and obscure the ceramic structure densely. These particles
    cluster in pits, size from 1-10 micrometers, and distribute unevenly across the
    surface. Degradation shows as micro-cracks and pitting, weakened by contaminants,
    so the material looks brittle and less durable for aerospace or medical uses.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the tungsten carbide surface appears
    very-very smooth and clean, with contaminants removed then polished effectively.
    This process restores the ceramic material's original shine and texture, so it
    looks like new without scratches or residues. Material integrity remains strong
    and intact, preserving hardness for aerospace, automotive, and medical applications.
    Quality is high-high, ensuring durability and performance.
