      research_basis: Tungsten carbide (WC-Co) has excellent corrosion resistance
        in neutral and alkaline environments and good resistance to many acids, though
        it is susceptible to corrosion in oxidizing acids due to the cobalt binder.
        It is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, seawater, and many industrial
        chemicals, placing it well above most metals but below some monolithic ceramics
        and noble metals.

      research_basis: Tungsten carbide (WC) has poor oxidation resistance in air and
        begins to oxidize significantly at temperatures of 500-600°C, forming tungsten
        trioxide (WO₃). The value of 600°C is consistently cited in materials handbooks
        as the upper limit for continuous service in an oxidizing environment before
        rapid, destructive oxidation occurs.
