        research_basis: Rosewood contains natural oils and dense grain structure that
          provide excellent resistance to moisture, decay, and insect attack. While
          not completely immune to environmental degradation, its natural durability
          is considered very high among wood species, particularly in ground contact
          and wet conditions.

          for Wood.'
        research_basis: The Wood Handbook, a primary reference for wood science, states
          that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 150°C (300°F) causes significant
          degradation in most wood species. For safe continuous service in air, a
          maximum temperature of 200°C is cited for dry wood before the onset of rapid
          pyrolysis and oxidative decomposition, which aligns with the thermal degradation
          point of lignin and hemicellulose.

          for Brazilian Rosewood
        research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties,
          reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra)
          as 18,200 psi, which converts to approximately 125 MPa. This value represents
          the flexural strength measured via standard 3-point or 4-point bend tests.
          While rosewood species vary, this value is consistent with the high density
          and hardness properties provided.

          properties
        research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
          data for various wood species. For Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra),
          the reported compressive strength parallel to grain is 59.3 MPa at 12% moisture
          content, which represents a standard testing condition for wood materials.
          This value aligns with the known high density (0.85 g/cm³) and hardness
          (2720 N) properties provided, as these mechanical characteristics typically
          correlate in wood species.
