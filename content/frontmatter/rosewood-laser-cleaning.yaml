caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the rosewood surface displays fine dust particles
    and oily residues clinging to wood fibers. These contaminants fill pores, causing
    slight degradation with fiber swelling and minor discoloration.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the rosewood surface appears smooth and vibrant,
    with dirt and grime fully removed. This surface, it shows the natural grain patterns
    clearly, and the original reddish-brown hue returns without fading. Restoration
    quality is high; no burns or cracks appear, preserving the wood's density and
    strength. Material integrity stays intact, allowing safe use in furniture or decor
    applications.

        research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property
          data for various wood species. For Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra),
          the reported compressive strength parallel to grain is 59.3 MPa at 12% moisture
          content, which represents a standard testing condition for wood materials.
          This value aligns with the known high density (0.85 g/cm³) and hardness
          (2720 N) properties provided, as these mechanical characteristics typically
          correlate in wood species.

          not completely immune to environmental degradation, its natural durability
          is considered very high among wood species, particularly in ground contact
          and wet conditions.
