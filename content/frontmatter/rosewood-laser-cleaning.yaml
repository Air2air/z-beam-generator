    compressiveStrength:
      value: 59.3
      min: 20
      max: 80
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database provides comprehensive mechanical property data for various wood species. For Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), the reported compressive strength parallel to grain is 59.3 MPa at 12% moisture content, which represents a standard testing condition for wood materials. This value aligns with the known high density (0.85 g/cm³) and hardness (2720 N) properties provided, as these mechanical characteristics typically correlate in wood species.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Rosewood contains natural oils and dense grain structure that provide excellent resistance to moisture, decay, and insect attack. While not completely immune to environmental degradation, its natural durability is considered very high among wood species, particularly in ground contact and wet conditions.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 125.0
      min: 40
      max: 150
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Database, a widely cited authority on wood properties, reports the modulus of rupture (MOR) for Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) as 18,200 psi, which converts to approximately 125 MPa. This value represents the flexural strength measured via standard 3-point or 4-point bend tests. While rosewood species vary, this value is consistent with the high density and hardness properties provided.

      value: 2720.0

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      min: 82.0
      max: 204.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook, a primary reference for wood science, states that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 150°C (300°F) causes significant degradation in most wood species. For safe continuous service in air, a maximum temperature of 200°C is cited for dry wood before the onset of rapid pyrolysis and oxidative decomposition, which aligns with the thermal degradation point of lignin and hemicellulose.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 2.1
      min: 0.33
      max: 4.4
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: This value represents the Mode I fracture toughness (K_IC) for rosewood in the longitudinal-radial (LR) crack propagation system, which is the most commonly reported orientation for wood fracture toughness testing. The value falls within the typical range for dense hardwoods (1.5-3.5 MPa·√m) and accounts for rosewood's high density and anisotropic structure.
