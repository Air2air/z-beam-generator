caption:
  beforeText: In microscopic view, the tool steel surface exhibits contamination from
    oxide particles and process residues, appearing as irregular clusters. This debris,
    adherent and fine-grained, induces pitting and micro-cracks, thus degrading the
    topography for machining applications.
  afterText: The cleaned surface of this tool steel, achieved through precise laser
    ablation, presents a flawless, mirror-like condition free from oxidation or debris.
    This restoration quality revives the material's original luster and topography
    with exceptional fidelity. Integrity remains fully intact, preserving the alloy's
    hardness and fatigue resistance essential for demanding tooling and machining
    applications.
