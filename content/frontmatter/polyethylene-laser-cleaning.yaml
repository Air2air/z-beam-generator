caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the polyethylene surface reveals a rugged terrain
    marred by contaminants—fine dust particles and oily residues clustered unevenly.
    These impurities, they measure 5-20 microns, embedding into micro-cracks and causing
    localized pitting. Such degradation weakens the plastic's integrity, promoting
    further wear in cleaning applications, where smoothness is essential for efficacy.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the polyethylene surface restores to a smooth,
    contaminant-free state, mirroring its original luster. This restoration, it preserves
    the material's integrity fully, with no thermal degradation or loss in flexibility
    and chemical resistance. Quality remains high, ideal for sustained cleaning applications.

          resistant to aqueous solutions, demonstrating minimal degradation even with
          prolonged exposure. However, it has poor resistance to strong oxidizing
          acids and certain organic solvents, and is susceptible to environmental
          stress cracking, preventing a perfect 10 rating.

          with its density and molecular structure. For common grades of medium-density
          polyethylene (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which align with
          the provided density of 0.93 g/cm³, typical flexural strength values from
          standardized 3-point bend tests (e.g., ASTM D790) fall in the range of 20-30
          MPa. The cited value of 25 MPa is a representative median for this density
          range, as confirmed by materials property databases and handbooks.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for polyethylene
          is consistently cited in materials handbooks and polymer science references
          as being in the range of 80-85°C. At this temperature, long-term exposure
          leads to significant thermo-oxidative degradation, causing a loss of mechanical
          properties. The lower end of this range (80°C) is the conservative and most
          commonly referenced limit for general-purpose polyethylene.
