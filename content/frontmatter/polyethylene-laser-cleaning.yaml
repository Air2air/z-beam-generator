  description: Microscopic analysis of Polyethylene surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: "Under the microscope, the polyethylene surface reveals a rugged terrain\
    \ marred by contaminants\u2014fine dust particles and oily residues clustered\
    \ unevenly. These impurities, they measure 5-20 microns, embedding into micro-cracks\
    \ and causing localized pitting. Such degradation weakens the plastic's integrity,\
    \ promoting further wear in cleaning applications, where smoothness is essential\
    \ for efficacy."
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the polyethylene surface restores to a smooth,
    contaminant-free state, mirroring its original luster. This restoration, it preserves
    the material's integrity fully, with no thermal degradation or loss in flexibility
    and chemical resistance. Quality remains high, ideal for sustained cleaning applications.
