    compressiveStrength:
      value: 20.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Polyethylene's compressive strength varies with type (HDPE,
        LDPE) and test conditions (typically at 23°C, 50% RH, strain rate 1-5 mm/min).
        The reported value of ~20 MPa represents a typical range for medium-to-high
        density polyethylene under standard ASTM D695 testing.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Polyethylene exhibits excellent resistance to a wide range of
        corrosive environments including acids, bases, and salts. It is particularly
        resistant to aqueous solutions, demonstrating minimal degradation even with
        prolonged exposure. However, it has poor resistance to strong oxidizing acids
        and certain organic solvents, and is susceptible to environmental stress cracking,
        preventing a perfect 10 rating.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 25.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of polyethylene varies significantly with
        its density and molecular structure. For common grades of medium-density polyethylene
        (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which align with the provided
        density of 0.93 g/cm³, typical flexural strength values from standardized
        3-point bend tests (e.g., ASTM D790) fall in the range of 20-30 MPa. The cited
        value of 25 MPa is a representative median for this density range, as confirmed
        by materials property databases and handbooks.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 80.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature in air for polyethylene
        is consistently cited in materials handbooks and polymer science references
        as being in the range of 80-85°C. At this temperature, long-term exposure
        leads to significant thermo-oxidative degradation, causing a loss of mechanical
        properties. The lower end of this range (80°C) is the conservative and most
        commonly referenced limit for general-purpose polyethylene.

    fractureToughness:

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness (K_IC) of polyethylene varies significantly
        with molecular weight, crystallinity, and processing conditions. For medium
        to high density polyethylene at room temperature, reported values typically
        range from 1.0 to 4.0 MPa·√m. Higher molecular weight grades achieve the upper
        end of this range, while lower density materials fall toward the lower end.
        The ASM Handbook provides this range as characteristic of polyethylene materials.
