caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the plaster surface displays fine cracks and pitting
    from degradation, with dark dust particles and oily residues embedded in porous
    areas. This reveals uneven texture and material loss, affecting overall integrity.
  afterText: The laser-cleaned plaster surface shows a smooth, even finish free of
    residues. This treatment demonstrates excellent restoration quality, reviving
    the original texture without compromise. Material integrity remains fully intact,
    and it ensures the masonry's enduring strength for general applications.

          as it is highly soluble in water and readily deteriorates in moist or humid
          environments. ASTM standards classify gypsum plasters as unsuitable for
          exterior or wet service conditions due to their susceptibility to water
          damage and lack of chemical stability when exposed to moisture, which is
          the primary driver of general environmental corrosion.

        confidence: 0.85
        research_basis: For brittle, cementitious materials like plaster, a well-established
          empirical relationship exists where the flexural strength is typically 20-30%
          of the compressive strength. Given the provided compressive strength of
          12.4 MPa, this predicts a flexural strength of approximately 2.5 - 3.7 MPa.
          Independent data sheets for gypsum plaster consistently report 3-point bend
          test results in the range of 2.8 to 3.4 MPa, with 3.1 MPa being a representative
          median value for a plaster of this density and compressive strength.

          before rapid degradation, though practical limits are lower (~600°C) due
          to dehydration phases.
