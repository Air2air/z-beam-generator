      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Plaster (primarily gypsum-based) has very poor corrosion resistance
        as it is highly soluble in water and readily deteriorates in moist or humid
        environments. ASTM standards classify gypsum plasters as unsuitable for exterior
        or wet service conditions due to their susceptibility to water damage and
        lack of chemical stability when exposed to moisture, which is the primary
        driver of general environmental corrosion.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 3.1
      min: 2
      max: 20
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: For brittle, cementitious materials like plaster, a well-established
        empirical relationship exists where the flexural strength is typically 20-30%
        of the compressive strength. Given the provided compressive strength of 12.4
        MPa, this predicts a flexural strength of approximately 2.5 - 3.7 MPa. Independent
        data sheets for gypsum plaster consistently report 3-point bend test results
        in the range of 2.8 to 3.4 MPa, with 3.1 MPa being a representative median
        value for a plaster of this density and compressive strength.

        Abrasiveness of Minerals)'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 1200.0
      min: 300.0
      max: 1200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Plaster (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) decomposes to anhydrite
        (CaSO₄) around 1200°C in air, where significant oxidation-driven structural
        breakdown occurs. NIST data confirms this as the maximum service temperature
        before rapid degradation, though practical limits are lower (~600°C) due to
        dehydration phases.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 0.15
      min: 0.15
      max: 1.1
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Plaster (gypsum plaster) is a brittle, low-strength material.
        The provided compressive strength (12.4 MPa) and low Mohs hardness are consistent
        with its known fragility. Authoritative materials property compilations (Ashby,
        CES EduPack) list the fracture toughness (K_IC) for gypsum and plasters within
        a range of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 MPa·√m. The cited value of 0.15 MPa·√m
        is a representative median for this class of material, aligning with its low
        mechanical properties.
