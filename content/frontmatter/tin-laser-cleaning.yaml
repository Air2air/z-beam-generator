caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the tin surface appears rough and uneven, covered
    by irregular dark spots of contaminants like oxide particles and organic residues.
    These cling tightly, causing localized pitting and dulling the metal's natural
    luster. This degradation weakens its use in electronics and food equipment, and
    it shows early corrosion signs.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the tin surface looks smooth and bright, free from
    dirt, oxide layers, and contaminants. This restoration demonstrates high quality,
    with even removal that preserves the metal's softness and low melting point. Essential
    for electronics manufacturing and food equipment, it maintains integrity without
    heat distortion, and aids cultural heritage by gently reviving original luster.
