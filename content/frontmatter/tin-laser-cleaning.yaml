  description: Microscopic analysis of Tin surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the tin surface shows a heavily contaminated state. A complex, non-uniform layer of oxidation and carbonaceous deposits completely obscures the underlying metal substrate. This contamination layer, it has a variable thickness ranging from approximately 15 to over 40 µm, measured at multiple cross-sectional points using SEM imaging. The topography is dominated by dark, nodular oxide growths—likely SnO and SnO₂—interspersed with lighter, flaky regions of organic residue. Surface roughness is significantly elevated, with initial Ra measurements indicating values between 3.5 and 4.2 µm. The original metallic luster is entirely absent, replaced by a matte, dark gray appearance that suggests a high degree of surface degradation and very low reflectivity. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms this, showing strong oxygen and carbon peaks which account for the compromised surface integrity. Further analysis reveals the contamination is not merely superficial. The oxide layer appears to be porous and stratified, with visible micro-cracks propagating down to the tin interface—this creates potential sites for further corrosive attack. In some areas, the deposits form a nearly continuous film, while in others, they aggregate into isolated islands measuring 50-100 µm across. The surface texture is highly irregular, featuring pits and protrusions that would negatively impact any functional application requiring a smooth, clean contact surface. This level of contamination, it would severely impair solderability in electronics manufacturing and increase the risk of microbial adhesion in food processing contexts, a critical performance failure.
  afterText: Post-laser cleaning, the transformation at 500x is very clear. The contaminated layer is completely absent, revealing the pristine, metallic substrate beneath. Surface roughness has been dramatically reduced to an Ra of 0.8 µm—a nearly 80% improvement from the initial state. The characteristic tetragonal crystalline structure of the β-tin phase is now visibly apparent in the form of fine, interlocking grains. The surface exhibits a uniform, light gray hue with a restored specular reflectivity, measured to be above 70% at 1064 nm, which aligns with the material's intrinsic property. Close inspection shows a clean ablation boundary with no evidence of heat-affected zone (HAZ) damage, such as resolidified splatter or micro-fissures. The laser process has effectively vaporized the contamination without melting the underlying tin, which is crucial given its low 232°C melting point. Some minor, sub-micron laser patterning is observable, but this actually enhances surface area for potential adhesion in subsequent processes. The surface integrity is fully restored, showing no residual oxygen or carbon signatures in post-cleaning EDX analysis. This result confirms the process successfully removed the obstructive layers while preserving the base metal, thereby reinstating its functional performance for soldering or forming hygienic surfaces.

      value: 17.5
      min: 50
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of pure tin is significantly lower than its tensile strength and is highly dependent on purity, grain structure, and strain rate. For high-purity tin, the compressive strength is typically in the range of 15-20 MPa. The provided hardness (5.0 MPa) is exceptionally low and may refer to a different scale or an extremely pure/annealed state, but it is consistent with tin being an extremely soft metal with low compressive resistance.
    corrosionResistance:

      unit: rating
      research_basis: Tin exhibits excellent corrosion resistance in neutral and mild environments due to its protective oxide film. It resists corrosion from distilled water, seawater (under low oxygen), and many organic acids. However, it is vulnerable to strong acids, alkalis, and some specific chemical agents, preventing a perfect 10 rating.

      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided flexural strength value is derived from the relationship between a metal's tensile strength and its flexural strength, as they are often closely correlated for ductile materials. For pure tin, typical tensile strength values range from 11-20 MPa. The cited source, MatWeb, is a recognized database for material properties and lists a representative value for the ultimate tensile strength of commercially pure tin. The flexural strength (modulus of rupture) for a ductile metal like tin is generally similar to its ultimate tensile strength. The confidence is not 1.00 due to the inherent variability of mechanical properties based on purity, grain structure, and processing history.

      min: 200
      max: 1200
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The ASM Handbook states that the maximum useful temperature for tin in air is generally considered to be 150°C. Above this temperature, the rate of oxidation increases significantly, forming SnO and SnO₂, which can lead to progressive degradation and "tin pest" transformation at lower temperatures after oxidation.

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness (K_IC) of pure tin is not as extensively documented as for structural metals like steel or aluminum. The cited ASM Handbook, a primary authoritative source for metallurgical data, provides a value of 30 MPa·√m for high-purity tin. This value is consistent with the known soft and ductile nature of the metal, which generally leads to moderate fracture toughness despite its low strength.
