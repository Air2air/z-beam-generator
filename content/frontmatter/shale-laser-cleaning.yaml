        research_basis: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of clay
          minerals. It is highly susceptible to weathering and corrosion in general
          environmental conditions. Its clay mineral composition makes it prone to
          absorption of water, leading to swelling, disintegration (slaking), and
          chemical breakdown when exposed to freeze-thaw cycles, rain, and atmospheric
          acids. While resistant to compression, its environmental durability is poor,
          leading to rapid deterioration compared to other stones like granite or
          limestone.

          and Mineral Properties"'
        research_basis: Shale, as a sedimentary rock composed of clay minerals, begins
          significant dehydration and oxidation of its constituent minerals (like
          pyrite and organic carbon) around 500-600°C. The 550°C threshold is cited
          as the maximum continuous service temperature in oxidizing atmospheres before
          structural degradation and chemical changes become significant.

          Geology.
        research_basis: Shale's flexural strength is highly variable (5-20 MPa) due
          to bedding planes and fissility. The provided value of 10.3 MPa is a representative
          median from standardized 3-point bend tests on intact, dry specimens, as
          reported in authoritative geotechnical and dimension stone references. This
          value reflects the material's inherent weakness parallel to bedding, which
          is the typical failure mode.

        research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent
          with shale. However, shale's compressive strength is highly variable, ranging
          from 10 MPa to over 200 MPa, depending on composition, anisotropy, and moisture
          content. The cited FHWA source provides a typical range of 5-100 MPa for
          intact shale, with a common representative value of 50 MPa for design purposes,
          which aligns with the given material properties.
