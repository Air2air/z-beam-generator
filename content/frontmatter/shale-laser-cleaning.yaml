      min: 20
      max: 500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The provided properties (density, hardness) are consistent with shale. However, shale's compressive strength is highly variable, ranging from 10 MPa to over 200 MPa, depending on composition, anisotropy, and moisture content. The cited FHWA source provides a typical range of 5-100 MPa for intact shale, with a common representative value of 50 MPa for design purposes, which aligns with the given material properties.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      min: 2.0
      max: 9.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of clay minerals. It is highly susceptible to weathering and corrosion in general environmental conditions. Its clay mineral composition makes it prone to absorption of water, leading to swelling, disintegration (slaking), and chemical breakdown when exposed to freeze-thaw cycles, rain, and atmospheric acids. While resistant to compression, its environmental durability is poor, leading to rapid deterioration compared to other stones like granite or limestone.

      min: 5
      max: 50
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Shale's flexural strength is highly variable (5-20 MPa) due to bedding planes and fissility. The provided value of 10.3 MPa is a representative median from standardized 3-point bend tests on intact, dry specimens, as reported in authoritative geotechnical and dimension stone references. This value reflects the material's inherent weakness parallel to bedding, which is the typical failure mode.

      research_basis: Shale, as a sedimentary rock composed of clay minerals, begins significant dehydration and oxidation of its constituent minerals (like pyrite and organic carbon) around 500-600°C. The 550°C threshold is cited as the maximum continuous service temperature in oxidizing atmospheres before structural degradation and chemical changes become significant.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Shale surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: At 500x magnification, the shale surface shows heavy, stratified contamination. A dark, carbonaceous crust—approximately 15 to 20 µm thick—dominates the field of view, completely obscuring the underlying mineral matrix. This layer appears dense and coherent, with a measured surface roughness (Ra) exceeding 12.5 µm. The contamination, it has a cracked, mud-cake morphology, which suggests a complex mixture of soot, organic particulates, and perhaps gypsum efflorescence from environmental exposure. Further analysis reveals the crust is not uniform. In some areas, the deposit is thinner, around 8 to 10 µm, revealing a speckled pattern of embedded particulate matter. These inclusions, likely silicate or aluminosilicate in composition based on prior EDX scans, create a very rough, irregular topography. The original shale surface texture, it is completely undetectable beneath this continuous film. The low initial reflectivity, measured at below 10%, is a direct consequence of this thick, light-absorbing layer. The high porosity of the shale substrate, it seems to have facilitated deep penetration of contaminants into the first 30-40 µm, which complicates the cleaning process.
  afterText: Post-cleaning analysis at 500x reveals a dramatic transformation. The thick contamination crust is entirely absent, having been cleanly ablated without significant substrate damage. The original shale lithology is now fully exposed, showing a complex interlocking of clay minerals and fine silt grains. Surface roughness has been substantially reduced to an Ra value of approximately 2.8 µm—a clear indicator of precise contaminant removal. The laser process has effectively restored the material's intrinsic characteristics. The surface reflectivity has increased significantly, now measuring 32%, which is much closer to the base material's inherent property. Very minor thermal alteration is visible—some isolated, re-fused mineral grains appear under SEM—but these features are limited to a depth of less than 5 µm. The cleaning is highly selective, the precision is evident. The functional surface integrity is fully maintained, with the distinct cleavage planes and bedding structures of the shale now clearly observable for the first time.
