caption:
  beforeText: Under the microscope, the shale surface looks rough and uneven, covered
    in fine dust particles and oily residues that cling tightly. This contamination
    causes discoloration in patches, and it demonstrates early signs of degradation
    like tiny cracks and pitting from prolonged exposure. Cleaning can restore its
    natural texture.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the shale surface shows a smooth, even restoration.
    It revives the natural stone texture and color, while preserving material integrity
    without cracks or layer damage.

        research_basis: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of clay
          minerals. It is highly susceptible to weathering and corrosion in general
          environmental conditions. Its clay mineral composition makes it prone to
          absorption of water, leading to swelling, disintegration (slaking), and
          chemical breakdown when exposed to freeze-thaw cycles, rain, and atmospheric
          acids. While resistant to compression, its environmental durability is poor,
          leading to rapid deterioration compared to other stones like granite or
          limestone.
