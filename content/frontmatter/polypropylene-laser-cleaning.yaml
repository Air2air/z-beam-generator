caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the polypropylene surface appears dirty-dirty and
    uneven, covered by oily contaminants that stick-stick tightly and gritty particles
    that scatter-scatter across it. These make the texture rough-rough, so degradation
    shows as small-small pits and micro-cracks, weakening the plastic then reducing
    its smoothness for cleaning applications.
  afterText: The polypropylene surface is cleaned very-very thoroughly by the laser
    process, restoring smoothness and shine. Material integrity remains intact, appearing
    pristine and undamaged.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of polypropylene is consistently
          reported in the range of 30-40 MPa by materials databases and polymer handbooks.
          The provided value of 35 MPa is a typical median for general-purpose grades.
          It is important to note that this property is highly dependent on the specific
          grade (e.g., homopolymer vs. copolymer), fillers, strain rate, and test
          temperature, which are often not specified in generalized data sheets.

          to a wide range of acids, alkalis, and solvents, making it highly suitable
          for chemical containers and piping. It is susceptible to degradation by
          strong oxidizing agents and some organic solvents, which prevents a perfect
          score, but its overall chemical resistance in common environments is considered
          very high.

          MPa represents a standard mid-range value for general-purpose polypropylene,

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for polypropylene
          in an air (oxidizing) environment is typically cited as 100°C by standards
          organizations like UL and in engineering handbooks. This is the temperature
          at which long-term thermal aging and oxidation become significant concerns,
          limiting its mechanical properties over extended periods. While polypropylene
          can withstand short-term exposures to higher temperatures, 100°C represents
          the conservative upper limit for continuous use where oxidative degradation
          is controlled.
