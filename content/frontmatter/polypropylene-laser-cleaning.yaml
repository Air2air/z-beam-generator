    compressiveStrength:
      value: 35.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of polypropylene is consistently reported
        in the range of 30-40 MPa by materials databases and polymer handbooks. The
        provided value of 35 MPa is a typical median for general-purpose grades. It
        is important to note that this property is highly dependent on the specific
        grade (e.g., homopolymer vs. copolymer), fillers, strain rate, and test temperature,
        which are often not specified in generalized data sheets.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 8.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Polypropylene is widely recognized for its excellent resistance
        to a wide range of acids, alkalis, and solvents, making it highly suitable
        for chemical containers and piping. It is susceptible to degradation by strong
        oxidizing agents and some organic solvents, which prevents a perfect score,
        but its overall chemical resistance in common environments is considered very
        high.
    density:
      value: 0.905
      unit: g/cm³
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 2: Properties and Selection: Nonferrous

      research_basis: materials_science_literature
    flexuralStrength:
      value: 35.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: According to the authoritative materials database AZoM, the
        flexural modulus for Polypropylene is typically in the range of 1.5-2.0 GPa,
        and the flexural strength is reported as 25-45 MPa. The value of 35 MPa represents
        a standard mid-range value for general-purpose polypropylene, consistent with
        data from 3-point bend tests commonly used for polymer characterization.
    hardness:
      value: 75.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 8: Mechanical Testing and Evaluation (2000),
        Table 3 - Typical Mechanical Properties of Polypropylene; NIST Polymer Properties
        Database - Polypropylene Rockwell R scale data'
    oxidationResistance:
      value: 100.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for polypropylene
        in an air (oxidizing) environment is typically cited as 100°C by standards
        organizations like UL and in engineering handbooks. This is the temperature
        at which long-term thermal aging and oxidation become significant concerns,
        limiting its mechanical properties over extended periods. While polypropylene
        can withstand short-term exposures to higher temperatures, 100°C represents
        the conservative upper limit for continuous use where oxidative degradation
        is controlled.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 3.0
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: Standard reference texts for engineering materials consistently
        report the fracture toughness (K_IC) of polypropylene in the range of 3.0
        to 4.5 MPa·√m. The value of 3.0 MPa·√m represents a typical, conservative
        lower bound for general-purpose polypropylene at room temperature, as cited
        in Ashby & Jones, a primary academic source for material property data.
