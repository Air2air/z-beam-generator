      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally
        recognized authority on wood properties. For beech (Fagus spp.), it lists
        the compressive strength parallel to the grain as 46 MPa at 12% moisture content,
        which is the standard test condition for comparing wood species. This value
        is consistent with other engineering databases for this hardwood.

    corrosionResistance:
      value: 2.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Beech wood has poor natural durability against decay fungi and
        insects, with very low resistance to moisture and environmental degradation.
        According to wood durability classifications, beech is rated as "non-durable"
        to "slightly durable" with a service life of less than 5 years in ground contact.
        Its high permeability and lack of natural extractives make it susceptible
        to rot, fungal attack, and environmental corrosion when exposed to moisture
        or outdoor conditions without protective treatment.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 103.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA FPL is a preeminent authority
        on wood science. For beech (Fagus spp.), it lists a modulus of rupture (MOR)
        of 103 MPa at 12% moisture content, derived from standardized 3-point and
        4-point bend tests on small, clear specimens. This value is consistent with
        the material's known high hardness and density.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 200.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood is not a
        fixed point like a metal's melting point but is based on the onset of significant
        thermal degradation. For most wood species, including beech, prolonged exposure
        to temperatures above 200°C leads to pyrolysis, charring, and a rapid loss
        of mechanical strength, which is a form of oxidative degradation in an air
        environment. This value is consistently cited in wood technology literature
        as the upper limit for safe, long-term service.

        of the lower end of the reported range for clear, defect-free beech, which
        can vary with moisture content, density, and crack orientation.
