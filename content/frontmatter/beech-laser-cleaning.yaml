  description: Microscopic analysis of Beech surface before and after laser cleaning
    treatment
  beforeText: "Under the microscope, the Beech wood surface reveals a heavily contaminated\
    \ condition, with irregular deposits of dark, particulate matter\u2014likely organic\
    \ residues and fine dust\u2014clinging to the porous grain structure. These contaminants,\
    \ unevenly distributed, obscure the natural cellular patterns and create micro-roughness.\n\
    \nThis degradation manifests as softened fibers and minor pitting, where prolonged\
    \ exposure has eroded the protective lignin layer, compromising the wood's integrity\
    \ and aesthetic uniformity."
  afterText: The cleaned surface of beech wood now reveals a smooth, pristine condition,
    free from residues and imperfections. This restoration, it achieves high quality
    by preserving the material's natural integrity and structural strength, ideal
    for general applications.
