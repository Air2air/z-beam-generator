  beforeText: 'Under the microscope, the Beech wood surface reveals a heavily contaminated
    condition, with irregular deposits of dark, particulate matter—likely organic
    residues and fine dust—clinging to the porous grain structure. These contaminants,
    unevenly distributed, obscure the natural cellular patterns and create micro-roughness.


    This degradation manifests as softened fibers and minor pitting, where prolonged
    exposure has eroded the protective lignin layer, compromising the wood''s integrity
    and aesthetic uniformity.'
  afterText: The cleaned surface of beech wood now reveals a smooth, pristine condition,
    free from residues and imperfections. This restoration, it achieves high quality
    by preserving the material's natural integrity and structural strength, ideal
    for general applications.

        research_basis: Beech wood has poor natural durability against decay fungi
          and insects, with very low resistance to moisture and environmental degradation.
          According to wood durability classifications, beech is rated as "non-durable"
          to "slightly durable" with a service life of less than 5 years in ground
          contact. Its high permeability and lack of natural extractives make it susceptible
          to rot, fungal attack, and environmental corrosion when exposed to moisture
          or outdoor conditions without protective treatment.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood is not
          a fixed point like a metal's melting point but is based on the onset of
          significant thermal degradation. For most wood species, including beech,
          prolonged exposure to temperatures above 200°C leads to pyrolysis, charring,
          and a rapid loss of mechanical strength, which is a form of oxidative degradation
          in an air environment. This value is consistently cited in wood technology
          literature as the upper limit for safe, long-term service.
