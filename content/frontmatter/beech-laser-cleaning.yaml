        research_basis: Beech wood has poor natural durability against decay fungi
          and insects, with very low resistance to moisture and environmental degradation.
          According to wood durability classifications, beech is rated as "non-durable"
          to "slightly durable" with a service life of less than 5 years in ground
          contact. Its high permeability and lack of natural extractives make it susceptible
          to rot, fungal attack, and environmental corrosion when exposed to moisture
          or outdoor conditions without protective treatment.

        research_basis: The maximum continuous service temperature for wood is not
          a fixed point like a metal's melting point but is based on the onset of
          significant thermal degradation. For most wood species, including beech,
          prolonged exposure to temperatures above 200°C leads to pyrolysis, charring,
          and a rapid loss of mechanical strength, which is a form of oxidative degradation
          in an air environment. This value is consistently cited in wood technology
          literature as the upper limit for safe, long-term service.

        research_basis: The Wood Handbook from the USDA FPL is a preeminent authority
          on wood science. For beech (Fagus spp.), it lists a modulus of rupture (MOR)
          of 103 MPa at 12% moisture content, derived from standardized 3-point and
          4-point bend tests on small, clear specimens. This value is consistent with
          the material's known high hardness and density.

        research_basis: The Forest Products Laboratory's Wood Handbook is a globally

          the compressive strength parallel to the grain as 46 MPa at 12% moisture
          content, which is the standard test condition for comparing wood species.
          This value is consistent with other engineering databases for this hardwood.
