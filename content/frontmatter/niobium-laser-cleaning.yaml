caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopic scrutiny, the niobium surface exhibits a contaminated
    condition with adherent oxide particles and debris. These contaminants, irregular
    in shape and ranging from 5 to 40 micrometers, form patchy layers that obscure
    the metal's luster. Such buildup induces degradation, including micro-pitting
    and roughened topography, compromising structural integrity.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, niobium's surface gleams with restored uniformity,
    free of oxides and residues that once marred its purity. This treatment delivers
    exceptional restoration quality, reviving the metal's innate smoothness without
    inducing defects. Material integrity holds firm—ductility, strength, and corrosion
    resistance preserved intact. Precision in the process, it safeguards the alloy
    for critical uses in aerospace and medicine.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of pure, annealed niobium is typically
          in the range of 240-310 MPa. The value of 275 MPa is a representative mid-range
          value for high-purity, recrystallized niobium at room temperature. This
          property is highly dependent on purity and work hardening; cold working
          can significantly increase the value.

        research_basis: Flexural strength is not a primary reported property for pure,
          ductile metals like niobium, as they yield rather than fracture in a brittle
          manner. The value provided is an engineering estimate derived from the ultimate
          tensile strength (UTS) of annealed, commercially pure niobium, which is
          typically in the range of 275-345 MPa. For a conservative estimate, the
          lower end of this UTS range is used as a proxy for flexural strength, as
          the two are often closely related for metallic materials. This is a standard
          approach for ductile metals where a specific 3-point or 4-point bend test
          value is not commonly published.
