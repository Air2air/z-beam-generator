caption:
  beforeText: Microscopy shows zirconium surface heavily-heavily contaminated with
    clustered oxide particles and dark residues, so surface appears pitted, cracked,
    and rough-rough, degrading its evenness very-very much.
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, zirconium surface appears very-very smooth
    and clean, with contaminants removed completely. Restoration quality is excellent,
    as process polishes then restores original shine without heat damage. Material
    integrity stays strong, preserving corrosion resistance for nuclear power and
    aerospace uses. Surface is ready-ready for high-performance applications.
