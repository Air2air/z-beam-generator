caption:
  beforeText: Under microscopy, the vanadium surface shows widespread contamination
    from oxide layers and particulate debris, likely from chemical processing exposure.
    Dark, irregular patches cluster unevenly, causing pitting and micro-cracks that
    roughen the texture. This degradation weakens the metal's integrity for aerospace
    and nuclear uses, as it promotes further corrosion and reduces precision in high-stakes
    environments.
  afterText: After laser cleaning, the vanadium surface looks smooth and even, free
    from oxides and residues. This treatment restores its natural metallic luster,
    and it maintains the material's core properties like high strength and heat resistance.
    The process shows no signs of thermal distortion or weakening, ensuring full integrity
    for uses in aerospace, nuclear energy, and chemical processing. Overall, restoration
    quality is precise and reliable.
