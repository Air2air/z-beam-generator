  beforeText: 'Under microscopy, the quartz glass surface appears very-very contaminated,
    with fine dust particles and oily residues scattered everywhere and then clustered
    in spots. Contaminants show irregular shapes, sizes from nanometers to microns,
    sticking tightly and blocking transparency. Surface degradation is evident: micro-pits
    form, edges roughen, and overall smoothness is lost, so the material looks dull
    and weakened.'
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean, with dirt removed then shine restored quickly. Integrity stays
    strong, no cracks or damage seen, so material looks like new. Process cleans effectively
    and preserves optical properties well.

        research_basis: The compressive strength of fused quartz (quartz glass) is
          exceptionally high compared to its tensile strength. The cited authoritative
          handbook provides a typical value of 1.1 GPa (1100 MPa) for the compressive
          strength of this material, which is consistent with the known brittle nature
          of glass where compressive strength is significantly higher than tensile
          strength.

          like Corning and Heraeus as having "exceptional chemical purity and resistance,"
          being nearly inert to most acids, salts, and water. It is attacked only
          by hydrofluoric acid and strong alkalis at high temperatures, giving it
          superior but not perfect resistance across general environmental conditions.

          with typical flexural strength ranging from 30-70 MPa. The value of 50 MPa
          represents a conservative average from materials engineering references
          for 3-point bend testing of pristine, annealed specimens. The low strength
          is characteristic of glass's brittle nature and sensitivity to surface flaws.

          quartz glass has excellent thermal stability, prolonged exposure above this
          temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere can lead to surface devitrification
          (crystallization), which is the primary oxidation-related degradation mechanism,
          rather than the formation of a gaseous oxide.
