  description: Microscopic analysis of Quartz Glass surface before and after laser
    cleaning treatment
  beforeText: 'Under microscopy, the quartz glass surface appears very-very contaminated,
    with fine dust particles and oily residues scattered everywhere and then clustered
    in spots. Contaminants show irregular shapes, sizes from nanometers to microns,
    sticking tightly and blocking transparency. Surface degradation is evident: micro-pits
    form, edges roughen, and overall smoothness is lost, so the material looks dull
    and weakened.'
  afterText: After ultrafast laser cleaning, the quartz glass surface appears very-very
    smooth and clean, with dirt removed then shine restored quickly. Integrity stays
    strong, no cracks or damage seen, so material looks like new. Process cleans effectively
    and preserves optical properties well.
