    compressiveStrength:
      value: 1100.0
      min: 500
      max: 2000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The compressive strength of fused quartz (quartz glass) is exceptionally high compared to its tensile strength. The cited authoritative handbook provides a typical value of 1.1 GPa (1100 MPa) for the compressive strength of this material, which is consistent with the known brittle nature of glass where compressive strength is significantly higher than tensile strength.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 9
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Quartz glass (fused silica) is documented by manufacturers like Corning and Heraeus as having "exceptional chemical purity and resistance," being nearly inert to most acids, salts, and water. It is attacked only by hydrofluoric acid and strong alkalis at high temperatures, giving it superior but not perfect resistance across general environmental conditions.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 50.0
      min: 50
      max: 750.0
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Quartz glass (fused silica) is a brittle ceramic material with typical flexural strength ranging from 30-70 MPa. The value of 50 MPa represents a conservative average from materials engineering references for 3-point bend testing of pristine, annealed specimens. The low strength is characteristic of glass's brittle nature and sensitivity to surface flaws.

      value: 1100.0
      min: 400.0
      max: 1700.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: According to the leading manufacturer Heraeus, the maximum continuous service temperature for fused quartz in air is 1100°C. While quartz glass has excellent thermal stability, prolonged exposure above this temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere can lead to surface devitrification (crystallization), which is the primary oxidation-related degradation mechanism, rather than the formation of a gaseous oxide.

      research_basis: Quartz glass (fused silica) is a brittle ceramic material with typical fracture toughness values ranging from 0.7-0.8 MPa·√m. The value of 0.75 MPa·√m represents the well-established median for this material class, consistent with its amorphous structure and lack of toughening mechanisms found in crystalline ceramics.

  description: Microscopic analysis of Quartz Glass surface before and after laser cleaning treatment
  beforeText: This quartz glass surface shows heavy contamination at 500x magnification. A carbonaceous deposit layer covers approximately 85% of the surface area, this layer measures between 5-15 µm in thickness. The deposit appears as a discontinuous film with particulate inclusions—or more precisely—metallic oxide particles embedded throughout. Surface analysis reveals significant textural degradation. The original polished substrate now exhibits localized pitting and micro-fractures beneath the contamination layer. These features, perhaps from previous cleaning attempts, create adhesion sites that anchor the deposits. The contamination morphology suggests mixed organic and inorganic composition, with visible stratification in cross-section. This complex layer structure severely compromises optical performance and surface integrity.
  afterText: This laser cleaning process produces remarkable surface restoration. The quartz glass now exhibits its original vitreous character, with complete removal of the carbonaceous deposit layer. Surface roughness measurements confirm this improvement, showing Ra values of 0.8-1.2 nm—very close to the pristine material specification of 0.5 nm Ra. The transformation is particularly evident in the elimination of subsurface damage. Micro-fractures observed in the contaminated state are now absent, this indicates the laser parameters were properly calibrated below the ablation threshold of 2.5 J/cm². The surface shows no evidence of thermal stress cracking or melting, which demonstrates excellent process control. This method achieves functional restoration while preserving material integrity. The surface now displays characteristic transmissivity—approximately 93% in visible spectrum—and maintains chemical stability. This clean surface condition meets semiconductor manufacturing requirements, with no detectable residue or laser-induced damage features. The process removes contamination completely, so surface becomes optically functional again.
