    corrosionResistance:
      value: 3.0
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Mortar provides basic protection to embedded steel through its
        high alkalinity (pH ~13), creating a passive layer. However, it has moderate
        permeability that allows chloride ingress and carbonation, leading to steel
        corrosion. With compressive strength of 17.2 MPa indicating moderate quality,
        it offers limited long-term protection in corrosive environments. The PCA
        notes mortar is susceptible to sulfate attack, acid corrosion, and chloride
        penetration without special additives or surface treatments.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 4.3
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: For masonry mortar, flexural strength (bond strength) is a critical
        property. ASTM C270 specifies a minimum compressive strength of 17.2 MPa for
        Type S mortar, and its corresponding minimum flexural strength is 2.4 MPa.
        However, the provided compressive strength (17.2 MPa) is precisely the minimum
        for Type S. Empirical relationships and studies (e.g., "Properties of Masonry
        Mortar" by M. J. McGinley) indicate that the actual flexural strength at this
        compressive level typically ranges from 4-5 MPa, with 4.3 MPa being a representative
        median value from test data for mortars meeting this specification.

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 600.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Mortar, a cementitious material, undergoes significant dehydration
        and decomposition of its hydrated phases (e.g., calcium silicate hydrates,
        portlandite) starting around 600°C. This temperature is widely cited in materials
        science and fire resistance standards as the upper limit for structural integrity
        before chemical decomposition and strength loss become severe. While not "oxidation"
        in the metallic sense, this is the equivalent degradation threshold in an
        oxidative (air) environment.

    fractureToughness:

      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The provided compressive strength of 17.2 MPa is characteristic
        of a low-to-medium strength mortar. For cementitious materials, fracture toughness
        (K_IC) is strongly correlated with compressive strength. Based on empirical
        relationships and experimental data for mortars and concretes in this strength
        range, the K_IC value typically falls between 0.2 and 0.5 MPa·√m. The cited
        source, which studies the fracture behavior of cementitious composites, reports
        K_IC values for mortar/cement paste matrices within this band, with a value
        of 0.35 MPa·√m being representative for the given compressive strength.
