        research_basis: Zirconia (zirconium dioxide) exhibits excellent corrosion
          resistance due to its highly stable oxide structure. It demonstrates exceptional
          inertness to most organic and inorganic acids, alkalis, and salt solutions
          at ambient temperatures. Its corrosion resistance is superior to many other
          technical ceramics, particularly in harsh chemical environments, though
          it can be susceptible to certain concentrated acids and basic oxides at
          elevated temperatures.

        research_basis: Zirconia (ZrO₂) is already the fully oxidized state of zirconium,
          making it exceptionally stable. Its high service temperature is limited
          not by oxidation but by phase transformations and creep. The cited ASM reference
          provides a maximum service temperature in air of 2400-2500°C for high-purity,
          stabilized zirconia ceramics, with 2400°C representing a conservative upper
          limit for continuous service before significant grain growth or mechanical
          degradation occurs.

          Typical values for yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP)
        research_basis: The flexural strength of zirconia ceramics is highly dependent
          on the specific type (e.g., Y-TZP) and processing. For 3-point bend tests,
          common engineering-grade yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) typically exhibits
          flexural strengths in the range of 800-1200 MPa. The value of 900 MPa represents
          a conservative, well-established average for this high-performance ceramic
          used in structural applications.

        research_basis: Zirconia's compressive strength is significantly higher than
          its tensile strength due to its ceramic nature. The value of 2000 MPa is
          a well-established, conservative average for partially stabilized zirconia
          (PSZ) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP), which are common high-strength
          engineering grades. The exact value can vary based on specific formulation
          (stabilizer content), porosity, and grain size, but authoritative materials
          handbooks consistently report values in the range of 1.8 - 2.5 GPa for dense,
          high-quality zirconia.
