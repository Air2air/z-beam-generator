    compressiveStrength:
      value: 2000.0
      min: 100
      max: 7000
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: Zirconia's compressive strength is significantly higher than
        its tensile strength due to its ceramic nature. The value of 2000 MPa is a
        well-established, conservative average for partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ)
        and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP), which are common high-strength engineering
        grades. The exact value can vary based on specific formulation (stabilizer
        content), porosity, and grain size, but authoritative materials handbooks
        consistently report values in the range of 1.8 - 2.5 GPa for dense, high-quality
        zirconia.
    corrosionResistance:
      value: 9.0
      min: 8
      max: 10
      unit: rating
      research_basis: Zirconia (zirconium dioxide) exhibits excellent corrosion resistance
        due to its highly stable oxide structure. It demonstrates exceptional inertness
        to most organic and inorganic acids, alkalis, and salt solutions at ambient
        temperatures. Its corrosion resistance is superior to many other technical
        ceramics, particularly in harsh chemical environments, though it can be susceptible
        to certain concentrated acids and basic oxides at elevated temperatures.

    flexuralStrength:
      value: 900.0
      min: 50
      max: 2500
      unit: MPa
      research_basis: The flexural strength of zirconia ceramics is highly dependent
        on the specific type (e.g., Y-TZP) and processing. For 3-point bend tests,
        common engineering-grade yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) typically exhibits
        flexural strengths in the range of 800-1200 MPa. The value of 900 MPa represents
        a conservative, well-established average for this high-performance ceramic
        used in structural applications.
    hardness:
      value: 12.0
      min: 6.0
      max: 2500
      unit: GPa
      research_basis: 'ASM Handbook, Volume 8: Mechanical Testing and Evaluation (2000),

    oxidationResistance:
      value: 2400.0
      min: 600.0
      max: 2400.0
      unit: °C
      research_basis: Zirconia (ZrO₂) is already the fully oxidized state of zirconium,
        making it exceptionally stable. Its high service temperature is limited not
        by oxidation but by phase transformations and creep. The cited ASM reference
        provides a maximum service temperature in air of 2400-2500°C for high-purity,
        stabilized zirconia ceramics, with 2400°C representing a conservative upper
        limit for continuous service before significant grain growth or mechanical
        degradation occurs.

    fractureToughness:
      value: 5.0
      min: 2
      max: 10
      unit: MPa·√m
      research_basis: The fracture toughness of zirconia is highly dependent on its
        specific phase composition and stabilizer content (e.g., Yttria). For the
        most common engineering-grade zirconia, 3 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia
        (3Y-TZP), the fracture toughness typically ranges from 4 to 6 MPa·√m. The
        cited source provides a central, well-accepted value of 5.0 MPa·√m for this
        widely used material.
