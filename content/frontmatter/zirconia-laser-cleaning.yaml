  beforeText: Under microscopy, Zirconia's contaminated surface reveals oily residues
    and particulates, causing pitting. This degrades integrity for aerospace seals.
  afterText: After meticulous cleaning, the zirconia ceramic surface exhibits a pristine,
    mirror-like finish with no residual contaminants or micro-abrasions, restoring
    its optical clarity essential for laser systems. Restoration quality is exceptional,
    achieving sub-micron smoothness that preserves the material's inherent toughness
    and thermal stability. Integrity remains fully intact, with no phase transformations
    or cracks, supporting reliable performance in aerospace applications like precision
    optics.
