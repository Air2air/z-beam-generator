# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# 1. Each material should have 5-10 industryTags
# 2. Tags should match applicationTypeDefinitions from Categories.yaml
# 3. Order by relevance (most common applications first)
# 4. Consider both current uses and laser cleaning potential
# 5. Be specific but comprehensive

# VALIDATION RULES:
# - All tags must be from the approved list above
# - Minimum 3 tags, maximum 15 tags per material
# - Each tag must be a valid application type
# - Format: YAML list with proper indentation

# RESEARCH APPROACH:
# For each material, consider:
# 1. Common industrial applications
# 2. Specialized uses requiring laser cleaning
# 3. Regulatory/compliance drivers (medical, food, etc.)
# 4. Material properties suggesting applications
# 5. Cross-reference with existing regulatoryStandards if available
