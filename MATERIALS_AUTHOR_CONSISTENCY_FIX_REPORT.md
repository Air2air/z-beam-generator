## Root Cause Analysis
The inconsistencies occurred because:
1. Caption generation updated the `captions.author` field with the correct author
2. The top-level `author` field was not updated to match
3. This created confusion about which voice pattern should be expected

## Data Integrity
✅ All fixes use `captions.author` as the source of truth (most recent generation)
✅ Complete author metadata preserved (country, expertise, id, image, etc.)
✅ No other material data was modified
✅ Backup created before any changes

## Validation
All fixes have been validated and no inconsistencies remain.
